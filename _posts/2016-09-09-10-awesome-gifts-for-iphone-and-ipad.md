The year is coming to a close, so that means it’s the holiday gift-giving season. If you’re on the hunt for a perfect gift idea, here are 10 great gifts for iPhone and iPad users.

1\. [Apple AirPods Pro](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPC9QD4)
-------------------------------------------------------------

[Apple AirPods Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07ZPC9QD4) [Apple AirPods Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07ZPC9QD4) [Buy Now On Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07ZPC9QD4) $249.00

[Apple AirPods Pro](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPC9QD4) are probably high on the list of any Apple device user, and for good reason. The completely wireless earbuds take what makes the AirPods so popular and add some great features to the mix.

The biggest perk is active noise cancellation technology, something not found in many other earbuds. With three different sizes of tips and a special fit test, you’ll find the most comfortable fit that also provides the best noise cancellation. A special Adaptive EQ also changes the audio to the shape of your ear.

The earbuds are also resistant to sweat and water, making them perfect for a workout or run. And just like the AirPods, the AirPods Pro quickly and easily connects with an iPhone or iPad and other Apple devices, including an Apple Watch and Mac.

2\. [Apple Watch Series 5](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XR5T85R)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Another great gift for iPhone users is an Apple Watch. And the [Apple Watch Series 5](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XR5T85R) is a great way for anyone to track and improve their overall health, stay in touch with family and friends, and depend less on an iPhone.

Thanks to the always-on Retina Display, the Series 5 will display the time and watch face (complications included) without having to turn your wrist or touch the screen. Another exclusive feature is a built-in compass. You can also keep track of your daily activity and even take an ECG to get a better idea of your heart health.

There are two different sizes of the watch, along with a number of different case and band options to suit your taste. You can also purchase a version of the watch with cellular capability that can fully operate away from an iPhone.

While most iPhone users have a wireless charger at home or work to juice up their handset, they probably still have a Lightning cable in their car. But you can cut the cord on the go [Belkin Boost Up Wireless Charging Vent Mount](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RNRHHR6).

Made for any iPhone that supports wireless charging, the mount provides the fastest possible charging speed. It securely attaches to any air vent in a vehicle. The adjustable brackets fit a wide variety of phone sizes and thinner cases. You can even place an iPhone in portrait and landscape mode.

Thanks to the combination of hardware and iPadOS 13, current iPad Pro models are taking big steps forward in productivity. But one major part of the equation is missing—a hardware keyboard. While Apple offers its own optional Smart Keyboard Folio, anyone looking to get some serious work done should look at the [Brydge Pro Keyboard for 11-inch iPad Pro](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MTSF94C).

The keyboard can turn the iPad Pro into a MacBook-like clone. The adjustable backlit keyboard features well-spaced keys with good travel. Connecting via Bluetooth, a single charge of the keyboard provides up to 12 months of use. There is even a special row of keys with iPadOS specific functions.

You can choose from a silver or space gray version to match the iPad Pro color choices. There is also a version available for the larger, 12.9-inch iPad Pro. A snap-on magnetic cover protects the back of the tablet while on the go.

Now that Apple’s AirPods and other completely wireless headphones have become commonplace, you’ve probably run into a problem at the gym, on an airplane, and other locations—a 3.5mm jack. Instead of having to forgo watching a video or listening to music, you can use the [Twelve South AirFly Duo](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Z13H4TP).

While traveling or on the go, you’re probably carrying a cable and a charging adapter. And the combination always seems to take up an inordinate amount of room in a mangled mess on the bottom of your bag. But Fuse’s [The Snap Back](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZHJ8FK5) brings the two essential items together. The organizer makes it simple.

First, you’ll insert the charger into The Snap Back, insert the USB cable and then wrap it around the outside. When it’s charging time, you can control the amount of cable, too.

Along with the version for the 12W Apple charger that can juice up an iPhone or iPad with a Lightning cable, Fuse has a version for the 5W iPhone charger, the 18W USB-C adapter that can charge an iPhone and iPad Pro, and a 29/30W USB-C MacBook Air charger.
