Granted, Macs are relatively more secure than Windows due largely to the [better-optimized macOS](https://beebom.com/macos-catalina-features/). Besides, Apple’s sort of hypersensitive approach also ensures spammers and data trackers don’t have a free run. But that doesn’t mean Macs are immune to malware or spyware attacks. In fact, if you have been able to keep a close watch at macOS recently, you would already know that Apple’s offering has fallen prey to several viruses including mshelper, CrescentCore, and OSX/Linker. Well, that just goes on to bust the age-old myth that Mac users don’t need to have an extra layer of shield against viruses. If you don’t want to put your sensitive information at risk, get the best antivirus for your Mac in 2020.  

Best Mac Antivirus Software in 2020
-----------------------------------

  

Choosing the right antivirus solution out of a variety of offerings could be a little tricky. So, fixing the priority right at the beginning would be a much better way to go.  

### What Sort of Antivirus Solutions Should You Choose?

  

Courtesy an ever-growing competition, today you have the luxury to choose from dozens of paid and free antivirus for Mac ([and of course Windows](https://beebom.com/best-antivirus-for-windows-10/)). If you are not a power user, a free package with basic protection against viruses should be sufficient for you. But just in case you are dealing with highly sensitive files and want to ramp up the arsenal to fight out all the malicious attacks including adware, ransomware, and malware, a premium offering would be the right pick for you.  

Keep in mind, most security software goes well beyond just safeguarding your Mac against viruses. For instance, many of them come with built-in [password managers](https://beebom.com/best-password-managers-2018/), [VPNs](https://beebom.com/best-free-vpn-services/), and super handy [parental controls](https://beebom.com/set-up-parental-control-mac-macos-catalina/) to help you keep the online activity of you and your family under the watch. To make your job a tad easier, we have highlighted the features of each software and also given a short verdict based on what they have to offer. With that said, let’s explore the roundup of the top antivirus solutions for macOS!  

1\. Norton
----------

  

Norton has been in the game for several years as a trusted player. So, it deserves a chance to get your attention. The security software is **both feature-packed and offers the needed flexibility to customize everything in line with your needs**. Interface-wise, the software looks neat so getting a hang of the features seems less demanding.  

![Norton Antivirus software for Mac](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Norton-Antivirus-software-for-Mac-.jpg)

On the security front, Norton comes with multiple tools to ward off hacking and data tracking. With the smart firewall, it offers the required shield to your data. Plus, it also comes with **online threats and virus protection** to keep all of your sensitive information guarded. But what has caught my eyes in this security software is the **handy password manager** which makes handling the secure codes a painless exercise. If you often find it a bit inconvenient to deal with your passwords, you should keep this feature in mind.  

In an age where data hacking seems to have become the order of the day, there had never been more demand for VPN. Understanding this need, Norton provides a fast and reliable VPN to shield your online privacy. So, you can browse the web anonymously as your personal information will be safe. Depending on the plan you choose, the software also offers [cloud backup](https://beebom.com/dropbox-altenatives-cloud-storage-services/) to keep your files safe and accessible across devices. As for pricing, Norton antivirus comes at $19.99/year/user which seems kind of a steal given the host of security features. Everything considered; it’s one of the best antivirus packages for Mac that you can get right now.  

_**Price:** $19.99/year/Mac (basic)_

2\. intego
----------

  

If Norton claims to be the best in the business, intego antivirus package for Mac isn’t behind either. The security software ticks off all essential boxes to become a strong contender in the market. What stands it out from many other rivals is the ability to **eliminate malware with more precision**. So, if you are on the lookout to get full-fledged antivirus software that can fight out malware without any blemish, it is your top bet.  

![Intego antivirus software for Mac](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Intego-antivirus-software-for-Mac-.jpg)

Another department where intego has an edge over many other counterparts is real-time protection. The software comes with **a variety of shields against phishing, explicit content, and duplicate files.** Therefore, you can not only ward off phishing and inappropriate content but also prevent your Mac from being cluttered by unnecessary files.  

Often find your kids breaking the set rules? Well, you can use this security software to **keep track of your children’s activity** so that their usage remains guarded.

3\. Bitdefender
---------------

  

For those looking for the best of both worlds: **top-notch safeguard against virus and a comparatively affordable price**, Bitdefender appears to be an easy-picking. The software has been on the scene for several years and comes with a whole host of tools to get rid of viruses, ransomware, and malware. Besides, it also has the reputation of offering one of the fastest and in-depth scans.  

![Bitdefender antivirus for Mac ](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Bitdefender.jpg)

  
  

  

Apart from the deep scan, I find its defense against privacy invasion highly appreciable. The software allows you to **keep a close eye on the webcam and microphone**, ensuring you have the desired control over privacy. On the parental control front, I rate Bitdefender slightly higher than its counterparts thanks largely to a variety of settings. So, if you have an unruly kid who doesn’t like to follow your set rules, you can employ the necessary restrictions to keep him/her protected online.  

Bitdefender allows you to **locate, lock, and wipe out your device in case of theft or loss**. This is what you need to stay in control of your data even if your device is not near you. Additionally, it has the support for multiple platforms including iOS, Android, and Windows which offer more flexibility for the folks who have a variety of devices to manage.

4\. Avast
---------

  

I guess many of you had expected Avast to comfortably enter this roundup, hadn’t you? Frankly speaking, Avast has been one of my top picks ever since I started trying out antivirus on Mac. This security software is designed to shield your macOS device on three main fronts. It comes with a **strong suite of tools to take on malware.** Thus, keeping the malware attack away from your Mac shouldn’t be a big deal for you.  

![Avast antivirus software for macOS](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Avast-antivirus-software-for-macOS-.jpg)

The second important line of defense that Avast offers is **against the vulnerable Wi-Fi networks**. Considering how they can jeopardize the security of personal information, it’s a notable feature. The software immediately alerts you whenever anyone joins your network. That not only helps in keeping an eye on hackers but also stops anyone from misusing the internet plan.  

And the third is readied to **ward off ransomware by offering a strong wall** for your photos so that they won’t be encrypted with your approval. On top of all, Avast’s basic variant comes for free, which makes it probably the best free antivirus for Mac in 2020. As for the premium version, it is priced at $59.99/year which may be a touch expensive but it’s got enough goodies live up to the billing.

5\. Panda
---------

  

Claiming to provide ultimate virus protection, Panda is the kind of security software that can fit into the taste of most people. As to whether or not it has the tools to walk the tall talk, I would say that it won’t disappoint you – if not being able to stand out of the rest. For providing dependable antivirus protection, the software **bets big on a firewall** that has a good track record of detecting malicious stuff. So, you can rely on it to keep your Mac defended against viruses.  

![Panda antivirus solution for Mac ](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Panda.jpg)

Wi-Fi networks are often found to be the targets of hackers and prying neighbors. Thus, security software has **put more emphasis on providing a strong cushion to the Wi-Fi networks**. Additionally, the software also works pretty fast in scanning external/USB devices, making sure they remain protected from threats.  

Aside from offering reasonably good parental control, password manager, shield against ransomware, it provides the much-needed **data shield that allows you to encrypt all of your confidential information** as well. Add to that the compatibility with several platforms (i.e Windows, and Android) as well as the availability of free variant and it seems inline for a great pick.
