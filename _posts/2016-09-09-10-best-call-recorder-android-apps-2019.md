One of the most underrated features of a smartphone is the ability to record voice calls. While some of the OEMs like OnePlus, Xiaomi, and Huawei make sure to include this feature on their build of Android, the feature cannot be found natively on Android. For me, call recording is a very important feature, as it helps me save important conversations that I might want to refer later. It also makes it easier for me to discuss my ideas with colleagues on calls, as I know that everything that we brainstormed on, is safely saved on my phone. If for these reasons or reasons of your own, you need to record calls on your Android device, there are some really good apps present on the Play Store which let you do just that:  

_**Note****:** Since most of the apps on the list share an almost similar name, be sure to download the apps from the provided links only. Also, call recording is illegal in some countries, like the US, so remember to check your country’s status before you download and use any of these apps. _  

Best Call Recorder Apps for Android (Free and Paid)
---------------------------------------------------

  

1\. Truecaller
--------------

  

Most of us know Truecaller as a caller ID app which lets us identify unknown numbers. However, not many of us know that **Truecaller also offers a call recording feature which is quite good**. I am a fan of Truecaller as not only it lets me know who is calling me, but it also saves me from picking up spam calls. That’s why, having the call recording feature bundled with the Truecaller app is a boon for me. If you also use Truecaller app, instead of using any other app on this list, you can use it to record all your calls. That said, do note that the **call recording feature is not free and is a part of Truecaller’s premium plan which costs ₹49/month**.

However, before you decide to pay for the feature, you can use the 14-day free trial to check it out. The free trial is very important as not all Android devices are supported. You will have to install and use the app to see if your phone is supported or not. You can check out our article on **[how to use Truecaller to record calls](https://beebom.com/how-to-record-calls-truecaller-android/) which also includes a list of verified supported and unsupported devices**. I tested the call recording feature on my OnePlus 3 and it worked flawlessly. I had one of the best call recording experience, and hence, I highly recommend this app to anyone looking to record calls on their Android device.  

_**Download:** ([Free 14-day trial](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.truecaller), ₹49/month)_  

2\. Automatic Call Recorder
---------------------------

  

Automatic Call Recorder is one of the best call recording apps which you can currently download and use. **I used the app on a couple of different devices and it worked flawlessly on all of them**. The app lets you record any number of calls. It also gives you three different modes for automatically record your calls. You can either record all calls, record calls only for saved contacts, or record calls for numbers which are not saved in your contacts.

The app also **has a decent integration with DropBox and Google Drive,** so you don’t have to worry about running out of space on your smartphone. To top it all of, it also has a beautiful dark mode.
