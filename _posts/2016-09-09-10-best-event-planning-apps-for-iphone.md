Best Event Planners for iPhone and Android in 2020
--------------------------------------------------

  

As always, it’s better to get the expectations right up front for a more informed buying decision.  

### What Else Should You Expect from a Party Planner?

  

Both Apple’s [App Store](https://beebom.com/how-hide-unhide-app-store-purchases-iphone-ipad-mac/) and [Google’s Play Store and its alternatives](https://beebom.com/google-play-store-alternatives/) boast a variety of event planning apps. While some are pretty lightweight with simple features like a countdown, to-do list, and guest list, others go well beyond the basic rules. Should you want to have a simple yet efficient event planer, pick out the basic ones. However, if your need warrants a fully-featured party planner with an integrated task manager, note-taking tools, reminders, and calendars, choose the ones that are equipped to take care of all the needs.  

Also, note that we are featuring those apps here which you can use to plan small-scale events. If you are looking for event planning apps to help you manage an event which requires you to host a couple hundred or more attendees, their seating arrangements, ticketing, food, and more, then these apps are not for you. There are professional software that can help you with that. With that out of the way, let’s get to our list shall we?

Based on your requirements, you can **display or hide calendars, set different priorities for tasks** as per importance, and add unlimited notes so that you don’t forget any essential tasks.
