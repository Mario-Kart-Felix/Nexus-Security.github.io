We all use our iPhones for a variety of tasks, everyday. One of these tasks is getting directions to places that we’d like to visit, or checking up on traffic on our commute to and from work. Maps, GPS, and [navigation apps](https://beebom.com/google-maps-alternatives/) are what we use in these situations to figure out the best route to reach a destination, and to get an idea of how long it will take us to get there. Say, you’re visiting a new city, and you need to visit the best places that the city has to offer; it’s GPS and navigation apps to the rescue. Same goes for situations where you want to prevent getting lost in a new, unknown city. With that in mind, here are the 10 best GPS, and navigation apps for iPhone, that you should consider having on your device, for just such a situation.  

1\. Google Maps
---------------

  

Google Maps is by far the most widely used, and trusted GPS, and navigation app in the world. Developed by Google, and distributed for free, the app features **accurate traffic** data, multiple modes of transport for navigation and directions, as well as **automatic re-routing** in navigation due to traffic conditions, or missed turns, and exits.

The app also features street view, and indoor imagery, to allow users to virtually visit a place, before deciding on physically visiting it. Best of all, though, is the feature that allows users to **save maps for offline use**, so that they can get directions, and search the offline maps, even when they don’t have any data connectivity. This can prove extremely handy while visiting new cities, or going abroad.

The app features a **simple interface**, and focuses on letting the user choose the destination, and then providing them with the directions, and navigation. The best part about using Apple Maps, is its seamless **integration with Siri**, and the fact that it gets displayed on the lock screen, as well, which means that users can take a quick glance at the navigation, even if their phone got locked while driving.

If you’re using a car equipped with an Apple CarPlay system, then using Apple Maps gets even better.

10\. Triposo
------------

  

The Triposo is app is not so much a fully-fledged GPS and navigation app, as it is an app aimed at tourists. The app doesn’t feature a complete world map.
