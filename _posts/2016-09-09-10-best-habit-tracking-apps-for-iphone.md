Having said that, let’s get started with the top habit tracking apps for Android and iOS, shall we?  

1\. HabitShare

For a more **simplified habit tracking experience**, “HabitShare” is one of my top picks. Probably the best part about this app is the ability to make habit tracking absolute fun by keeping complexity at bay. For starters, you can ideally customize it to keep a tab on all the important aspects and stick to the set rules with the timely reminders. Thanks to the **detailed charts, daily/weekly habit goals, and insightful comments**, the app keeps you on track. Besides, you also have the option to add friends to bring some fun elements into the mix.

2\. Habitica
------------

  

What I like the most about Habitica is a **unique way to track habits** or whatever you have planned to accomplish.

So, if you are someone who admires a highly intuitive user-interface along with a whole host of features, keep this app in mind.

6\. Habit-Bull
--------------

  

While there is a lot to like in Habit-Bull, I would like to highlight three main features that make it worth giving a chance. First and foremost, the habit tracking app offers an **easy way to track multiple habits along with repeated to-dos** in the personalized calendar. And with the intuitive streak counter as well as the success percentage, it helps you keep an eye on the progress without needing to dive into the detail. Perfect for those who want to track their streaks on the move!  

![Habit Bull](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Habit-Bull.jpg)

Times when you feel a little down or don’t get the desired motivation to continue, some sort of impetus comes in really handy.

_**Price:** Free, in-app purchases available _  

_**Install:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/habit-bull-daily-goal-tracker/id1041482672) and [Android ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oristats.habitbull&hl=en_IN)_  

7\. Loop
--------

  

For those in quest of a **powerful habit tracker designed specifically for Android** devices, Loop appears to be a front-runner. The app may sport a simple design language but it comes with a range of easy-to-use tools that makes tracking habits a painless exercise. Being completely **ad-free and open-source** also helps its cause – to a great extent. It has a little different technique for calculating the habit score. While every repetition strengthens your habit, every missed day makes it weaker. In terms of analyzing your data, I find Loop up to the mark courtesy the presence of several charts. Furthermore, it also makes allows users to **export data to spreadsheets (CSV)** or to a database file (SQLite) which can be helpful for both sharing and compiling data.  

![Loop](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Loop.jpg)

_**Install:** [Android ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits&hl=en_IN)_  

8\. Habit
---------

  

Due mainly to the **minimal design language and easy-to-use tools**, Habit hasn’t failed to catch my attention. The app aims at making habit tracking an upfront task – free of any complexities. Depending on how you want to embrace good practices and give up the bad ones, you can **schedule habits and monitor your performance**. Thanks to the helpful widget, you can keep an eye on your progress without having to dive into the app. Additionally, the detailed graphs and statistics make you fully aware of how you have gotten better over time and even the areas that haven’t yet been addressed properly. Beyond progress tracking, I have found it quite smooth and snappier. Besides, Habit is also ad-free, letting you use it without any inconvenience.

_**Install:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/habit-daily-tracker/id1445651730)_  

9\. Goal Tracker & Habit List & Workout Calendar
------------------------------------------------

  

Yet another habit tracker designed specifically for Android users! Having given it a close look, I must say that it deserves serious consideration for multiple reasons. For one, the app **goes well beyond the usual habit tracking**. I mean it’s a one-stop platform for tracking goals and developing good habits for improved productivity. That aside, it also allows users to schedule habits with the desired flexibility. And with the **custom alerts**, it reminds them of each task that needs immediate attention. Even better, the app automatically backs up all the data and even allow them to **export to [Dropbox](https://beebom.com/dropbox-altenatives-cloud-storage-services/)** for easier access across devices.

10\. Done
---------

  

While Done may not be the most feature-packed habit tracker for iOS, it has got enough to offer a more pragmatic habit tracking experience. You can use this app for both **building great habits and destroying bad ones** at your own pace. With a variety of color options, it lets you add some nice personal touch to goal tracking. Additionally, you can also note down your thoughts with each routine so that they won’t slip out of your mind. As it **also supports Face ID/ Touch ID**, no one will be able to access your personal data without your permission. And if you ever want to share the data with anyone, you can export it in CSV format – which is yet another plus. Lastly, it’s worth noting that Done’s freemium version allows you to create only three habits. To break this limitation, you will need to go for the Done premium ($8.99 – one-time premium upgrade).
