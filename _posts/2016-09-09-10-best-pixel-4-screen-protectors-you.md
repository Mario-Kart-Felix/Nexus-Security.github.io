4\. Prism Screen Protector by Dbrand

So, if you want to try out the new screen protector by Dbrand, you can get one for your Pixel 4.

Further, ESR covers the whole display including the sensor areas, but you have some cutouts for major sensors like the front camera and Soli chip so no worries there.
