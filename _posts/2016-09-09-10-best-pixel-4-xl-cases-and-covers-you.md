After months of endless leaks and rumors, [Pixel 4 XL](https://beebom.com/pixel-4-launched-price-specs-details/) (along with its 5.7-inch smaller sibling) has finally arrived. Boasting the fastest “face unlock” and innovative motion-sensing Soli radar chip that gives the device a 180-degree sense of motion, Google’s latest flagship smartphone has got the quality to stand out. Add that to the dual-camera that bets big on astrophotography along with the 6.3-inch Quad HD display with 90Hz max refresh rate, and you have a premium smartphone with plenty of wow factor.
