You can argue that [Pixel 4 XL](https://beebom.com/pixel-4-launched-price-specs-details/) lacks a flashy design and even win the debate to a great extent. But when it comes to the display, Google’s latest flagship smartphone packs a solid punch with a resolution of 1440 x 3040 pixels and ~537 PPI pixel density. Add to that the 90Hz max refresh rate for ultra-smooth responsiveness, and the 6.3-inch Quad HD display shines where it counts. With that said, the top-notch display warrants enhanced shields to stay protected; considering glass (no matter how durable it is) is always susceptible to scratches and cracks. To keep the AMOLED display safeguarded against scratches and even unexpected bumps, we have dished out the best Pixel 4 XL screen protectors which you can buy for your brand new smartphone.  

Best Screen Protectors for Pixel 4 XL in 2019
---------------------------------------------

  

For improved protection against scuffs, we have picked out high-quality tempered glass screen guards for Pixel 4 XL. Most of these screen defenders sport 2.5D rounded edges for full-coverage and come with precise cutouts for perfect installation. And with bubble-free adhesives, they are incredibly easy to install. Better still, many accessory makers offer the screen protectors in multiple packs so that you get a highly protective screen defender for your Pixel device without having to dole out a lot of bucks. With that said, let’s jump right in to explore the roundup!  

1\. ESR
-------

  

I have always rated ESR’s screen guards very highly as they are quite strong. And this offering for Google’s latest flagship is no different. The company claims that the screen guard is **3x stronger** than other ordinary screen protectors in the market and can **withstand up to 5 kg of pressure**. Besides, it features rounded edges for complete protection against scuffs. And with an oleophobic coating, it can resist oil, fingerprints, and sweat to offer maximum sensitivity. Another thing worth reiterating is that ESR screen guard is **bubble-free** so that you won’t have any trouble while installing it on your Pixel smartphone.

2\. SPARIN
----------

  

Sporting **precise cutouts and smooth curved edge**, Sparin screen protector offers edge-to-edge protection to the OLED display of Pixel 4 XL. Made of high-grade tempered glass, the screen guard is very strong and boasts **9H hardness**. And with 0.33mm thickness, it can endure scratch and impact with ease. It also offers top-notch clarity so that you can view content without any glare. The ability to resist fingerprints and dust helps it keep both clarity and responsiveness intact for long. On top of all, Sparin offers the screen guards in four-packs at just one price, which makes it one of the cheapest screen protectors for Pixel 4 XL.

3\. OMOTON
----------

  

OMOTON doesn’t need any introduction, does it? The company has long been one of the leading manufacturers of screen guards. So, it didn’t have to put any effort to catch my attention. Talking about the quality of this screen protector, it features precise cutouts and has 2.5D rounded edges that go a long way in providing **full-coverage to the large 6.3-inch screen.** Another department where it stands out against many other counterparts is the responsiveness thanks mainly to the **oleophobic layer** that keeps oil, dust, and sweat at bay.

Claiming to deliver **99.9% high-definition clarity**, OEAGO screen guard deserves a shot on your Pixel 4 XL. As compared to other screen protectors in the market, it’s a bit thin.

5\. FilmHoo
-----------

  

I always prefer a screen guard that is designed to be **case-friendly** and gets along comfortably with any type of case. That’s the reason why FilmHoo has caught my eyes. With **0.25mm thickness**, it’s probably the thinnest screen protectors for Pixel 4 XL in the market right now. It provides HD clarity and comes with extra hydrophobic and oleophobic layers for **much-improved protection against scuffs** and oil. As for durability, it may not be the strongest out there but it can be trusted to endure impact and also take on nasty scratches with ease.

Simply put, QITAYO is one of the most durable screen protectors for Pixel 4 XL. Equipped with a **reinforced glass structure**, the screen guard provides a reliable defense to the touchscreen. Plus, it also features an **anti-dust nano-coating** which prevents dust and smudge from destroying smoothness. Another quality that makes QITAYO a fine option is a curved and smooth edge that gets fitted out seamlessly on the entire screen for edge-to-edge coverage.

Touted to provide **high-transparency and unmatched responsiveness**, Pulen screen guard is easily one of the best in the business. Thanks largely to the high-grade tempered glass, it is also equally robust when it comes to withstanding the challenges from scratches. At 0.33mm, the case is **a little thicker for additional safeguard against impact**. Besides, the neat cutouts along with bubble-free adhesives assist it to get installed perfectly on the screen.

Well, I have chosen this offering from TopAce specifically for the folks who have a limited budget to spend on a case and a screen protector. Made of **soft TPU material**, the TPU case is pretty slim and snaps around Pixel 4 XL snuggly. Plus, it also features a **geometric pattern** on the back for enhanced heat dissipation. So, there is less chance of your smartphone getting hot even after hours of gameplay or movie streaming.

A reasonably good screen guard like Tocol is worth giving a chance. The company claims that the screen defender provides **top-grade protection to the screen**. And looking at the durable tempered glass along with industry-standard hardness, I must say that it does seem to be a promising choice. While the neat cutouts make sure it doesn’t interfere with selfie camera and the motion sense technology, the ability to ward off dust and oil enables it to offer desired sensitivity.
