Every PC enthusiast wants to keep their computer’s processor temperatures as low as possible. Well, this is absolutely necessary, as the CPU shouldn’t run too hot, if you want to preserve its longevity. The stock CPU coolers that are bundled along with the processors available in the market today are sub-par and do not give you the best cooling performance. That’s exactly why most consumers prefer buying [better aftermarket coolers](https://beebom.com/best-cpu-coolers/) for significant improvements in thermal performance. Likewise, the thermal paste that’s usually provided with these coolers are not even close to the best ones out there.  

Well, if you have no idea what a thermal paste is, it’s nothing but a thermally conductive compound, that’s usually applied between the CPU and cooler’s heatsink, in order to prevent air gaps and fasten up the heat transfer between CPU and the cooler. So, if you’re an enthusiast who wants the absolute best thermal performance out of your CPU, we highly recommend you to purchase a high quality thermal paste. There are plenty of them available in the market, and if you’re confused regarding which one to go for, here are the 10 best thermal paste for CPU you can buy.

Cool Down Your CPU Using The Best Thermal Pastes
------------------------------------------------

  

The stock thermal paste that’s often bundled with the CPU coolers are certainly not even close to the best ones you can get your hands on. If you feel like your processor is running pretty hot, even at a low ambient temperature, you should certainly consider investing in a good thermal paste. Even if you have a laptop, you should consider getting the thermal paste replaced by an expert technician, as the compound used by the manufacturer is usually of average quality and not applied properly.  

Well, there are plenty of options to choose from. Depending on your budget and performance demands, you could choose between normal grease-based or liquid-metal based thermal compounds. We suggest you to go for liquid metal only if the slightest of temperature difference matters a lot to you. Otherwise, it’s not worth the risk at all.
