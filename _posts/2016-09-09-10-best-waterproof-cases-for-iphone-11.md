Putting protection at the forefront, Apple has doubled the water-resistance of the iPhone 11 Pro. That means the smartphone can resist water up to 4 meters deep for 30 minutes, which would be more than enough for most users. So, why would you ever need a waterproof case for your iPhone 11 Pro? Well, the biggest reason why you would want to put on a reliable waterproof cover before diving into a swimming pool, going for an exciting water-sport or going out in rains is that liquid damage is not covered under warranty. Moreover, Apple states that water resistance decreases over time as the phone gets older. And, you wont’ be able to charge your iPhone till it is wet. That’s why you better get one of the best waterproof cases for your iPhone 11 Pro to always stay on the safer side of the stream rather than pay a hefty price for the water damage repair.

Best Waterproof Cases for iPhone 11 Pro
---------------------------------------

  

All the waterproof cases lined up in this post feature IP68 waterproof rating and can shield your smartphone up to 2 meters deep in water for a minimum of 30 minutes (maximum up to 3 hours). Beyond the reliable water-resistance, these covers sport shockproof design and offer an additional safeguard for the triple-lens camera and Super Retina XDR display. Thanks largely to the shockproof construction, they are designed to be an ideal defender against all threats like rains, drops, scratches, snow, and dust. With that said, let’s find out which one of these top waterproof covers looks spot-on for your smartphone!  

1\. Lifeproof FRĒ
-----------------

  

Putting Lifeproof’s FRĒ at the top of this roundup feels like doing an age-old norm. To me, the best part about this waterproof cover is the **impressive design** that stands out in a seemingly crowded market. Well, if you often have to encounter rains or thundershowers and want a waterproof case for regular use, this has to be your top pick. Apart from the adorable profile, it has also got **enough resistance to fight out the impact as well.** And with the grippy sides, the cover feels more comfortable in the hands. But the only thing that may force you to think twice before going for this premium waterproof cover for iPhone 11 Pro is the high-price tag that stands head and shoulders above the pricing of other cases in the market.
