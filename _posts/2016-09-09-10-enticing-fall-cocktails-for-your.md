Whether you’re an oenophile or just enjoy the occasional glass with friends, this sangria is a great way to take wine to a whole new level. We understand some wine lovers wouldn’t dare mix other ingredients with their fermented grapes. However, some people can’t get enough of this sweet, refreshing beverage.

You don’t have to say goodbye to this summer BBQ classic just yet, because the autumn flavors in this version are out of this world. The tart apple, lemon, and lime flavors perfectly complement the cinnamon and cherry brandy. You’ll want more than one glass.
