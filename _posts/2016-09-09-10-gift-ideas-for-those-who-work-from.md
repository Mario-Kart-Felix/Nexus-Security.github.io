So, if you’re buying a gift for someone who works from home this Christmas, why not splash a little cash and get them something they’ll really appreciate? Everything from body massagers to good quality chairs is an option. It just depends on how much you’re willing to spend.

If you’re struggling for inspiration, keep reading. Here are 10 gifts ideas for people who work from home.

1\. [Shoyeido Ceramic Incense Burner](https://www.amazon.com/Shoyeido-Premium-HandCrafted-Ceramic-Incense/dp/B001AWCGY0/)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Shoyeido Ceramic Incense Burner](https://www.amazon.com/Shoyeido-Premium-HandCrafted-Ceramic-Incense/dp/B001AWCGY0?SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B001AWCGY0) [Shoyeido Ceramic Incense Burner](https://www.amazon.com/Shoyeido-Premium-HandCrafted-Ceramic-Incense/dp/B001AWCGY0?SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B001AWCGY0) [Buy Now On Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Shoyeido-Premium-HandCrafted-Ceramic-Incense/dp/B001AWCGY0?SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B001AWCGY0) $29.00

Buying an incense burner is an inherently Christmassy idea; the nativity story claims that one of the three wise men gave Jesus some Frankincense as a gift. Ergo, why not check out the [Shoyeido Incense Burner](https://www.amazon.com/Shoyeido-Premium-HandCrafted-Ceramic-Incense/dp/B001AWCGY0/)? An incense burner has two clear benefits for someone who works from home.

1.  Depending on which aromas you choose to burn, you can inspire creativity, relax your mind, soothe yourself to sleep, and a whole lot more.
2.  If you spend all day sitting in an enclosed office with the windows shut, it’s going to start smelling a little “funky” by the time you power down your computer. Burning incense can freshen up the mustiest of rooms.

2\. [Nature Bright SunTouch SAD Lightbox](https://www.amazon.com/NatureBright-SunTouch-Light-Therapy-package/dp/B000W8Y7FY/)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Nature Bright SunTouch Lightbox](https://www.amazon.com/Nature-Bright-SunTouch-Light-Therapy/dp/B000W8Y7FY?SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B000W8Y7FY) [Nature Bright SunTouch Lightbox](https://www.amazon.com/Nature-Bright-SunTouch-Light-Therapy/dp/B000W8Y7FY?SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B000W8Y7FY) [Buy Now On Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Nature-Bright-SunTouch-Light-Therapy/dp/B000W8Y7FY?SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B000W8Y7FY) $49.99

SAD is an acronym for Seasonal Affective Disorder. SAD is a form of depression that typically kicks in during Fall and Winter as the nights become longer and the weather deteriorates.

The [Nature Bright SunTouch Lightbox](https://www.amazon.com/NatureBright-SunTouch-Light-Therapy-package/dp/B000W8Y7FY/) is a remedy for people who suffer from SAD, but it’s also a great way to wake yourself up in the morning. After all, if you’ve been burning the candle at both ends to meet deadlines, you’re going to need a little help.

3\. [Viktor Jurgen Full Body Massager](https://www.amazon.com/VIKTOR-JURGEN-Electric-Handheld-Percussion/dp/B01MQ0Y25Z/)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Viktor Jurgen Full Body Massager](https://www.amazon.com/VIKTOR-JURGEN-Handheld-Back-Massager/dp/B01MQ0Y25Z?SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01MQ0Y25Z) [Viktor Jurgen Full Body Massager](https://www.amazon.com/VIKTOR-JURGEN-Handheld-Back-Massager/dp/B01MQ0Y25Z?SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01MQ0Y25Z) [Buy Now On Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/VIKTOR-JURGEN-Handheld-Back-Massager/dp/B01MQ0Y25Z?SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01MQ0Y25Z) $29.99

You might think your homeworking friend leads a life of luxury. Nothing could be further from the truth. Having an office, kitchen, and bedroom within a few yards of each other means there’s no motivation to get up and move around. Exercise is an afterthought; physical issues are a very real problem.

While it’s no substitute for going for a jog, a massage set can at least ease some of the aches and pains of sitting down all day. The [Viktor Jurgen Full Body Massager](https://www.amazon.com/VIKTOR-JURGEN-Electric-Handheld-Percussion/dp/B01MQ0Y25Z/) is a handheld device that works on a person’s head, neck, shoulders, back, legs, and feet.

4\. [Dreamfarm Cup Holder](https://www.amazon.com/Dreamfarm-Spink-Cup-Holder-Black/dp/B0026OJJUK/)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Dreamfarm Cup Holder](https://www.amazon.com/Dreamfarm-Spink-Cup-Holder-Black/dp/B0026OJJUK?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B0026OJJUK) [Dreamfarm Cup Holder](https://www.amazon.com/Dreamfarm-Spink-Cup-Holder-Black/dp/B0026OJJUK?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B0026OJJUK) [Buy Now On Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Dreamfarm-Spink-Cup-Holder-Black/dp/B0026OJJUK?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B0026OJJUK) $10.53

Keyboards and food are a bad combination. But keyboards and liquids are an (expensive) disaster waiting to happen. Of course, the obvious solution is to keep liquids well away from the computer. But we all know a typical homeworker’s desk is akin to the beverage fridge in a 7-Eleven.

If you don’t want to be buying the person a new keyboard next Christmas, get your buddy a cup holder this year instead. The [Dreamfarm Spink Cup Holder](https://www.amazon.com/Dreamfarm-Spink-Cup-Holder-Black/dp/B0026OJJUK/) has a suction pad on the bottom so it can never be knocked over.

5\. [Herman Miller Classic Aeron Task Chair](https://www.amazon.com/Herman-Miller-Aeron-Chair-Graphite/dp/B01N32UFNT/)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Herman Miller Classic Aeron Task Chair](https://www.amazon.com/Herman-Miller-Ergonomic-Adjustable-PostureFit/dp/B01N32UFNT?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01N32UFNT) [Herman Miller Classic Aeron Task Chair](https://www.amazon.com/Herman-Miller-Ergonomic-Adjustable-PostureFit/dp/B01N32UFNT?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01N32UFNT) [Buy Now On Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Herman-Miller-Ergonomic-Adjustable-PostureFit/dp/B01N32UFNT?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01N32UFNT) $1,395.00

A high-quality office chair is one of the most critical items in any homeworker’s office. It can prevent back problems and improve your posture.

Of course, the quality and price of chairs can vary drastically between brands. If the person you’re buying for is important to you, you might want to go for a top-of-the-range model. Arguably, the best chair is the [Herman Miller Classic Aeron Task Chair](https://www.amazon.com/Herman-Miller-Aeron-Chair-Graphite/dp/B01N32UFNT/). They’re pricey but impressive.

6\. Gym Membership
------------------

Sticking with the theme of physical health, why not buy the person a gym membership? It’s a not-so-subtle way to remind them that they need to venture beyond the perimeter of their property occasionally.

Again, gym memberships vary drastically in price. If you’re happy to send your buddy into a rough part of town, you can probably pick one up for a few bucks a month. If you want to send them to the local high-end spa, you can expect to pay more than $100 per month.

7\. [Bluelounge CableBox](https://www.amazon.com/Bluelounge-CableBox-Cable-Management-System/dp/B0019T0JA2)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite the tech firms’ best efforts, we still don’t live in a cable-free world. If anything, the number of cables around our machines is multiplying. Apple users know what we’re talking about (_cough_, dongles).

If the person you’re buying for is a neat freak, they probably die a little inside every time they see a mess of tangled cables. You could give them a helping hand and alleviate some stress by buying them a cable management system. There are lots of designs available, but in terms of value for money, you’ll struggle to beat the [Bluelounge CableBox](https://www.amazon.com/Bluelounge-CableBox-Cable-Management-System/dp/B0019T0JA2).

8\. [VIVO Standing Desk](https://www.amazon.com/VIVO-Adjustable-Converter-Workstation-DESK-V000K/dp/B075JYG2TB/)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[VIVO Standing Desk](https://www.amazon.com/VIVO-Adjustable-Converter-Workstation-DESK-V000K/dp/B075JYG2TB?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B075JYG2TB) [VIVO Standing Desk](https://www.amazon.com/VIVO-Adjustable-Converter-Workstation-DESK-V000K/dp/B075JYG2TB?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B075JYG2TB) [Buy Now On Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/VIVO-Adjustable-Converter-Workstation-DESK-V000K/dp/B075JYG2TB?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B075JYG2TB) $119.99

The jury is still out of the health benefits of standing desks. You’ll burn more calories, and some research suggests they can help stave off diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and breast cancer. Other research claims you’ll be at a higher risk of developing back, leg, or foot pain.

As with many things, the answer lies in moderation. Don’t suddenly go from sitting all day to standing all day—split your time between the two environments, instead. If you want to buy a practical-but-beautiful standing desk, check out the [VIVO Standing Desk](https://www.amazon.com/VIVO-Adjustable-Converter-Workstation-DESK-V000K/dp/B075JYG2TB/) as a thoughtful happy medium.

9\. [Click and Grow Indoor Garden Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Click-Grow-Smart-Garden-Indoor/dp/B01MRVMKQH)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Click and Grow Indoor Garden Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Click-Grow-Garden-Gardening-Capsules/dp/B01MRVMKQH?SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01MRVMKQH) [Click and Grow Indoor Garden Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Click-Grow-Garden-Gardening-Capsules/dp/B01MRVMKQH?SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01MRVMKQH) [Buy Now On Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Click-Grow-Garden-Gardening-Capsules/dp/B01MRVMKQH?SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01MRVMKQH) $99.95

While not usable in a traditional sense, a few office plants will brighten the place up no end. Let’s be honest, if you’re spending all day, every day in the same room, you want it to look nice. If the person you’re buying for loves smart home technology, you could buy a [Click and Grow Indoor Garden Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Click-Grow-Smart-Garden-Indoor/dp/B01MRVMKQH).

It comes with smart soil, a water reservoir, and temperature controls. The person won’t need to have green fingers to stop the plant from dying. Lots of seed cartridges are available; Click and Grow devices can grow everything from basil to cherry tomatoes.

10\. [Alexander Del Rossa Bathrobe](https://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Del-Rossa-Bathrobe-A0116STLMD/dp/B01DMKYJ2Y/)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Alexander Del Rossa Bathrobe](https://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Del-Rossa-Bathrobe-A0116STLMD/dp/B01DMKYJ2Y?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01DMKYJ2Y) [Alexander Del Rossa Bathrobe](https://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Del-Rossa-Bathrobe-A0116STLMD/dp/B01DMKYJ2Y?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01DMKYJ2Y) [Buy Now On Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Del-Rossa-Bathrobe-A0116STLMD/dp/B01DMKYJ2Y?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01DMKYJ2Y) $68.99

Do people who work from home even bother to get dressed in the morning? If your loved one is the type of person who spends all day in their pajamas in front of the computer, why not treat them to a new bathrobe? If they ever need to have a video conference call with colleagues, they’ll at least look semi-respectable.

Unsurprisingly, Amazon offers an abundance of bathrobes. If you want something that’s comfy and practical in equal measure, have a look at the [Alexander Del Rossa Bathrobe](https://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Del-Rossa-Bathrobe-A0116STLMD/dp/B01DMKYJ2Y/). They are made with 330GSM coral fleece and come in a variety of sizes and colors.
