Jump scares are those moments in films where everything has gone quiet and dark, and a sudden sound or movement jolts you out of your seat. This Halloween, entertain yourself (and your friends) with the best horror movies on Netflix full of jump scares.

Jump scares can provide cheap thrills or genuine frights, but no matter how they’re used, they’re always entertaining. And the following films make use of the technique so well they’re guaranteed to have you leaping out of your seat (and possibly your skin).

1\. [The Conjuring](https://www.netflix.com/title/70251894)
-----------------------------------------------------------

*   **Released in:** 2013
*   **IMDb Rating:** [6.6/10](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1457767)
*   **Rotten Tomatoes Rating:** [86%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_conjuring/)

The Conjuring has already been touted as one of the classic horror movies of all time. Director James Wan delivers the perfect treatment on one of the oldest storylines in horror movies: a family movies into a new farmhouse in the middle of nowhere, and creepy things start to happen. As usual, people who know about the supernatural (paranormal investigators, in this case) come to their rescue.

While it’s not a typical “jump scare” movie, Wan uses the classic trick to good effect throughout the film. There are a dozen such moments, according to [Where’s The Jump](https://wheresthejump.com/), but I’m pretty sure you’ll be frightened more often than that. It’s what makes The Conjuring one of [the best horror movies to watch on Netflix](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/horror-movies-watch-netflix-halloween/).

2\. [Insidious](https://www.netflix.com/title/70142542)
-------------------------------------------------------

*   **Released in:** 2011
*   **IMDb Rating:** [6.8/10](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1591095/)
*   **Rotten Tomatoes Rating:** [66%](https://rottentomatoes.com/m/insidious)

James Wan’s Insidious is a favorite among horror buffs for restarting the “family moves into a new house and discovers an evil spirit” trend of movies. Fans of The Conjuring will also get to see early glimpses into how Wan developed his creepy style.

The film is packed with jump scares, whether it’s how someone retells a dream about the devil or a paranormal investigator using a modified ViewMaster to look into realms invisible to the naked eye. Where’s The Jump counted a total of 24 jump scares in the film and rates it 5/5, so this is a guaranteed hit.

3\. [Candyman](https://www.netflix.com/title/347365)
----------------------------------------------------

*   **Released in:** 1992
*   **IMDb Rating:** [6.6/10](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103919/)
*   **Rotten Tomatoes Rating:** [74%](https://rottentomatoes.com/m/candyman)

The original Candyman is a delight for those who love jump scares and cheap thrills. It’s not mindless violence either, as the film also offers some insightful commentary on race in America.

Based on a Clive Barker short story, “The Candyman” is a local legend of a bogeyman with a hook for a hand. When a researcher (Virginia Madsen) invokes his spirit by saying his name five times in front of a mirror, a series of killings starts in the small town. Wait for the medicine cabinet scene…

4\. [The Lazarus Effect](http://www.netflix.com/title/80013269)
---------------------------------------------------------------

*   **Released in:** 2015
*   **IMDb Rating:** [5.2/10](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2918436/)
*   **Rotten Tomatoes Rating:** [14%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_lazarus_effect)

After making a documentary like Jiro Dreams of Sushi, you wouldn’t expect director David Gelb to dive into horror. But he is full of surprises in The Lazarus Effect, which is as creepy as they come.

Olivia Wilde and Mark Duplass star as medical researchers who have figured out how to resurrect dead animals. But a terrible accident claims Wilde’s life, and in his grief, Duplass decides to bring her back to life. It’s a success. Only the being that has come back to life seems to be losing Wilde’s soul and possessed by something much, much darker.

5\. [Creep](https://www.netflix.com/title/70306646) and [Creep 2](https://www.netflix.com/title/80168161)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   **Released in:** 2014 and 2017
*   **IMDb Ratings:** [6.3/10](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2428170/) and [6.4/10](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3654796/)
*   **Rotten Tomatoes Ratings:** [89%](https://rottentomatoes.com/m/creep_2014) and [100%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/creep_2_2017)

Looking for a double feature? “Found footage” horror films, like The Blair Witch Project, have its own set of fans. And it gets even more eerie when there isn’t a supernatural element involved. Creep and its sequel are must-watch movies in this genre.

The movies follow the premise of a young videographer finding a Craigslist ad from a man making a bizarre claim, and looking for someone to record it. In the first, the man supposedly wants to record a dying message. The sequel has him claiming to be a serial killer. The truth is stranger than either.

Mark Duplass and Patrick Brice write, direct, and star in both films. Duplass is frighteningly creepy, and Brice’s ability to mix jump scares with slowly-built tension is masterful.

6\. [Friend Request](https://www.netflix.com/title/80097516)
------------------------------------------------------------

*   **Released in:** 2016
*   **IMDb Rating:** [5.3/10](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3352390)
*   **Rotten Tomatoes Rating:** [17%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/friend_request)

Laura is a typical popular college student. She gets tons of friend requests on Facebook, and she’s happy to add everyone. But she accepts one too many, and unfriends Marina for being creepy. Laura didn’t expect how creepy things would get, as Marina commits suicide, and mysterious videos start appearing on Laura’s profile. Things get worse when Laura’s friends start dying.

The plot of Friend Request is quite silly, but it’s the perfect sort of movie to watch with your friends for a jump-scare delight. It was never going to win any Oscars, but if you can’t have fun with something like this, you might want to go for one of the [best horror films for geeks](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/beware-technology-best-horror-films-geeks/) where technology takes center-stage.

7\. [Scream](https://www.netflix.com/title/939827)
--------------------------------------------------

*   **Released in:** 1996
*   **IMDb Rating:** [7.2/10](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117571/)
*   **Rotten Tomatoes Rating:** [79%](https://rottentomatoes.com/m/1074316_scream)

In the first film in the Scream series, director Wes Craven reinvents the slasher-horror genre by adding 19 jump scares in the 111 minutes. This means you’ll be spilling the popcorn once every seven minutes, as you watch the adventures of Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, and David Arquette.

After her mother’s murder, a college student and her friends start getting scary phone calls from a serial killer in a strange white mask and a long black robe. The killer seems to be a fan of horror films, through which Craven pays homage to many classics. As new murders begin to hit the town, can the student and her friends survive?

Once you’re done with Scream, Netflix also has the two sequels, [Scream 2](https://www.netflix.com/title/1181550) and [Scream 3](https://www.netflix.com/title/60000415), available to watch. Craven has only increased the jump scares in those, so if you like the first film you’ll have a blast.

*   **Rotten Tomatoes Rating:** [15%](https://rottentomatoes.com/m/sinister_2)

The original Sinister is a stronger movie, but Sinister 2 has so many startling moments that you are guaranteed to enjoy it. Where’s The Jump counted five major and 14 minor jump scares in this movie. It’s a must-watch combination of creepy kids and a ghost with a scythe.

In Sinister 2, a mother and her twin sons movie into a remote house. Of course, the house holds many secrets and is the site of past murders.

It’s well known that you shouldn’t go to the Livingston House. Evil resides there. But that doesn’t stop six idiots from performing a seance in the place. In the course of events that followed, three died, one survived, and two went missing. It’s now to up Detective Mark Lewis and psychologist Dr. Elizabeth Klein to figure out what happened, rescue the missing people, and ensure that the house does not claim any more lives.
