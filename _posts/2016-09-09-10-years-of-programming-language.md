Via [EE Times](https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1335168#), it’s worth noting that there have been recent shifts in the popularity of certain programming languages that could give us clues about where the digital world is headed, and also remind us of how far we’ve come.

**Python ranks #1**  
IEEE Spectrum released its annual [ranking](https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages-2019) of program languages last month and many were surprised to see Python maintained its top spot. Python, a script-based language, has held the top spot in IEEE Spectrum’s ranking since 2017.

**Rankings from 10 years ago**  
In 2010, the TIOBE Programming Index ranked the top 10 languages in order as follows: Java, C, C++, PHP, (Visual) Basic, C#, Python, Objective-C, Perl, and Ruby.

> For some languages, such as Ruby and Ruby on Rails, runtime speed and boot speed just aren’t fast enough to support a full-scale commercial product. For other languages, like PHP, poor security was a huge factor that kept companies such as Facebook from continuing to utilize the language.

**Other factors: mobile devices, wearables**  
There are a few other factors that could have impacted the popularity of programming languages. The inherent security of the language is one factor. Another is the increase in popularity of mobile devices.
