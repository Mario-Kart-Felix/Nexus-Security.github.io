101+ Coding Interview Problems with Detailed Solutions, Test Cases, and Program Analysis
========================================================================================

January 6, 2020

Hi friends,

4 months ago, I made a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ctyvbc/is_anyone_interested_in_weekly_coding_interview/) on creating a newsletter that sends out 3-6 coding interview problems with details solutions every week. To my surprise, the post received a lot of attention and positive feedbacks from the community.

**Since the total number of problems and solutions has just passed 101, I would like to say another big thank you all again for all the support. It really helps me keep going.**

Moving on, I am hoping to add more questions and then finally condense them into a list of most frequently appeared coding interview problems that I think are the most valuable and productive to spend time on. Again, my goal has always been to help you get good at algorithms and data structures so that you can prepare better for your next coding interviews.

For those who don’t know, [here is the link to all 101+ questions and solutions, sorted by resources →](https://github.com/hoanhan101/algo)

Best,
