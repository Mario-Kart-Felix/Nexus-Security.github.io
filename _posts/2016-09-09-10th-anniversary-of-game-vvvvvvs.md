Terry Cavanagh [posts about the 10th anniversary of the game VVVVVV](http://distractionware.com/blog/2020/01/vvvvvv-is-now-open-source/), now released on GitHub:

> Today is the 10th anniversary of VVVVVV’s release!
> 
> Or possibly tomorrow is, depending on who you ask – technically, the game first went live at 3am GMT on the 11th January 2010, after a very, very long day of fixing every last bug I could, [making last minute builds](http://distractionware.com/blog/2010/01/conundrum/), and trying to slowly upload everything on an extremely unreliable internet connection that kept cutting out. But I’ve always gone by “_it’s not tomorrow until you wake up_” rules, so I still think of January the 10th as the real launch day <3

> Gosh, ten years.
> 
> VVVVVV is such an important game to me, I barely even know where to start. I wanted to do something special to mark the occasion: so, as of today, I’m releasing the game’s source code!

> The repo contains two versions – the desktop version, [ported to C++ by Simon Roth in 2011](http://distractionware.com/blog/2011/07/vvvvvv-version-2-0-launches-in-the-new-humble-indie-bundle/), and later [updated and maintained by Ethan Lee](http://distractionware.com/blog/2014/03/wanted-coder-for-vvvvvv-maintenance/) – and the mobile version, written in Actionscript for Adobe AIR, based on the original v1.0 flash version of the game.
