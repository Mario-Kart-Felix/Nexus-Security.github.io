After the smartphone boom, India is seeing a spike in TV sales thanks to some new players like Xiaomi and Vu. Gone are the days when you had to shell out tens of thousands of rupees just to buy a proper Full HD TV. Now, you can get a 4K TV at an affordable price and without compromising the quality of the display panel. So, in this article, I bring you a definitive list of best 4K TVs in India that you can buy right now. I have done thorough research and have picked only those TVs which offer maximum value and excellent display quality. That being said, let’s go through the article without any delay.  

Best 4K TVs in India Available Now
----------------------------------

  

Since different users have different budgets, I have categorized the article into three sections: **Budget, Mid-range, and Premium**. Mostly the TVs under the budget segment are within Rs. 20,000 to 40,000 range. However, I have taken the liberty and mentioned some TVs which are priced a little higher in the budget segment due to their better display quality and screen size. If you find them within your budget, go for it. Now having said that, let’s begin the article.  

*     
    
    Best Budget 4K TVs in India (~ Rs. 20,000 – 50,000)
    ---------------------------------------------------
    
      
    
  

### 1\. Mi LED TV 4X

  

If you are on a budget and want to buy a 4K TV then Xiaomi has you covered with its 2019 lineup of affordable new TVs. All 4X models released this year come with 4K resolution and Android TV out of the box. The **4X TVs have an HDR 10-bit panel with a refresh rate of 60Hz**. In terms of connectivity, you get 3 HDMI ports and 2 USB ports so that is great. In case you were wondering about the sound output, well Xiaomi has brought a powerful 20W (earlier it was 16W) speaker with Dolby and DTS-HD support. Now you can also access Netflix (catch the [best Netflix movies](https://beebom.com/best-netflix-movies/) and [Netflix Originals](https://beebom.com/best-netflix-originals/)) and Amazon Prime Video which were missing on earlier Mi TVs.  

![1. Mi LED TV 4X](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1.-Mi-LED-TV-4X.jpg)

Talking about the operating system, Mi TV 4X runs both PatchWall and Android TV (get the [best Andorid TV apps](https://beebom.com/best-android-tv-apps/)) with [Google Assistant](https://beebom.com/google-assistant-tricks/) support. Xiaomi also claims that **the TV is optimized by Vivid Picture Engine** which is supposed to bring true to life viewing experience. Taking all points into consideration, Mi TV 4X seems a great value proposition since you are getting a 4K TV at the sub-30k price point. However, keep in mind, the display panel is not as sharp as Samsung or LG’s panel. That is not to say that Xiaomi’s panel is mediocre or sub-standard. In fact, it’s quite good for the money you are paying, but it’s definitely a notch below these giant display manufacturers. Anyway, if you want to learn more about Mi TVs, [check out](https://beebom.com/best-mi-tv-features-tips/) our article on its features.

### 2\. LG 4K Smart LED TV

  

LG is one of the best display manufacturers in the world. So, if you want a 4K TV, you can definitely give a shot at its affordable smart LED TVs. **This LG TV offers 4K HDR with a 50Hz refresh rate and 20W sound output** with DTS-Virtual X support. It is also capable of upscaling the content so that you get a smooth viewing experience irrespective of the content resolution. Also, when it comes to viewing angles, their panels are considered the best. You have a wider view of angle and there is almost no to little color shift.

Next to that, the TV is powered by LG’s webOS which is not a fork of Android TV, but altogether a different platform. However, **you get all your favorite apps including [Netflix, Prime Video,](https://beebom.com/amazon-prime-video-vs-netflix/) Hotstar** and more. In case, you are wondering about voice assistant support, yes this TV also comes with both Google Assistant and Alexa built-in. Overall, this LG TV is a great value for money and if you want the best picture quality, you simply can’t go wrong with it.

### 3\. Samsung Super 6

  

If you want the best 4K TV and can extend your budget then consider getting the Samsung Super 6 TV. Since it’s Samsung, **the panel is absolutely great having rich colors and sharp picture quality.** For a quick overview, the panel comes with a 60Hz refresh rate and packs in a 20W speaker. There is also support for Netflix, Prime Video, Hotstart and more. The only downgrade with respect to Mi TV is that it’s not an HDR TV, but then Samsung’s picture engine is quite good and you will always get excellent color reproduction.

As an aside, Samsung has also brought a smart computer feature that allows you to **connect your smartphone to the TV and it becomes your workstation**. That’s cool, right? Anyway, the Super 6 is available in two sizes: 43 and 50 inches, so go ahead and choose whichever one that fits your bill.

So, as I said, go for Vu Premium TV if you want the largest screen on the wall at an affordable price. Also, if you want smaller 4K TVs, check out its smaller variants too.
