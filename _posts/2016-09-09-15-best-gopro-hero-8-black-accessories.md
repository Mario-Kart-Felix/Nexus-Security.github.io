Light Mod is another offering by GoPro to make your videos production-level straight out of Hero 8 Black. It’s also interesting to see that GoPro is slowly getting into the vlogging space with these mods. **It offers brightness ranging from 20 lumens to 200 lumens** which is absolutely great for a moving camera. There is also an overdrive mode which only lasts up to 30 seconds but offers maximum brightness above 200 lumens. Apart from that, the Light Mod comes with a built-in battery which is nice. However, keep in mind, you will need to buy the Media Mod to be able to attach this Mod with your Hero 8 Black.

13\. Official GoPro Battery and Dual Battery Charger
----------------------------------------------------

  

The new Hero 8 Black comes with HyperSmooth 2.0 stabilization and the ability to shoot videos up to 5.6K. All these features require an exceptional amount of battery so it’s better to keep an extra battery pack. Also, you should get a battery charger that can simultaneously recharge your batteries in no time. GoPro offers both these products at a low cost and you should definitely get this bundle. **The battery capacity is 1220mAh which is pretty good and the charger comes with fast charging** capability. I would say, if you regularly shoot videos with GoPro, this battery pack is indispensable.

14\. Anker PowerCore 10000
--------------------------

  

If an extra battery pack does not cut for you then a power bank will be a better proposition for endless video shooting with the Hero 8 Black. The Anker PowerCore 10000 is the best of the lot when it comes to charging speed and reliability. Also, the power bank is quite compact so it will not add any bulk while traveling to remote locations.
