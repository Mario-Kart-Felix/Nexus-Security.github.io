With a more compact design and the ability to work both as a regular GoPro and a 360-degree camera, it looks really promising for full-on adventure. So, if you have bought this exciting camera ([$499](https://geni.us/NhIzL)) and are hunting for the accessories to safeguard the cam and also get the most out of it, this wide assortment of the best GoPro Max accessories has got you fully covered.

To kickstart this extensive lineup of accessories for GoPro Max on a good note, I would like to put a high-grade screen guard like iTrunk right at the top. The PET screen protector is **completely bubble-free and delivers 99% HD clarity**. Apart from offering high clarity, it is also quite sensitive to the touch. Thanks to the silicone adhesives, the screen guard is pretty easy to install. As for scratch protection, iTrunk is fully capable of **shielding your 360-degree camera against scuffs.** Overall, it’s one of the finest screen guards for your GoPro Max.

Looking for a complete case for your GoPro Max? If the answer is yes, “kitway” can be a great option. The case is **made of waterproof material and offers an uncompromised safeguard to the camera lens.** With the acrylic screen, it provides much-improved color correction.

Speaking of versatility, it **works efficiently as a camera grip, an extension pole and a super handy tripod**. It’s extendable from 9 to 22-inch which makes it right on the money for both close-up and wide-angle shots.

Well, replacement folding adapters might not be on the high priority list for many GoPro Max owners but they are very essential. You can use them to **attach your GoPro to mounts and swap mounts quickly**. Even better, the tools also make it more convenient to install the spare parts. Thus, you should have replacement adapters as they are quite handy. Courtesy the durable quality and neat design, I prefer the official replacement folding adapters.

### 7\. Chesty

  

Chesty is exactly what you should pick to take awesome POV (point of view) shots. Due mainly to the convenience, it remains [my favorite GoPro accessory](https://beebom.com/best-gopro-accessories-for-hero-5-black-hero-5-session/), especially during an adventurous time. It’s made of **lightweight and breathable material.** Hence, it can fit both slim and fat body.

Best GoPro Max Power Bank and Memory Card
-----------------------------------------

  

### 1\. Tranmix

  

According to GoPro, Max can last up to 115 minutes (Wi-Fi Off/1080p/ 60fps) which may be good enough for many users. However, if you are someone who loves to snap a lot of pics and record tons of videos, the battery won’t live up to your demand. And this is where a powerful external battery pack like Tranmix has a role to play. The portable charger boasts a **massive 25000 mAh battery that can** **recharge** **your camera multiple times.** Moreover, it comes with four foldable solar panels which allow you to charge your GoPro even without an electric outlet, albeit slowly. With rugged construction and waterproof design, it’s primed to be a great asset for your adventures.

**Buy from Amazon:** [_$39.99_](https://geni.us/Rbx4Ek4)  

### 2\. GoPro Max Official Rechargeable Battery

  

If you don’t want to carry a massive power bank with you, an efficient rechargeable battery would be a great choice. GoPro offers a **high-quality rechargeable lithium-ion battery** that can work as a spare for your Max. Just toss a couple of them in your bag and you will be able to easily swap them out once the GoPro Max’s battery fully discharges. As for pricing, it’s a tad more expensive than other third-party offerings. But given the efficiency, I think it’s worth checking out.

### 3\. SanDisk 128GB Memory Card

  

This one is a no brainer, isn’t it? To securely store tons of videos and photos, you need a top-grade memory card. And when you think of buying one for your action camera, the name that instantly comes to mind is SanDisk. With up to **100MB/s transfer speed**, the memory card claims to **move up to 1000 photos in a minute**, which is an impressive number. Using the SanDisk app, you can easily manage your entire files. What’s more, the company offers the memory card in many capacities like 128 GB, 256 GB, and 512 GB. As for pricing, while the 128 GB variant comes at $19.93, the 512 GB variant is priced at $99.99.
