> Billed as the world’s largest open access digital archive dedicated to life on Earth, the [Biodiversity Heritage Library](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/) is comprised of animal sketches, historical diagrams, botanical studies, and various scientific research collected from hundreds of thousands of journals and libraries around the globe. In an effort to share information and promote collaboration to combat the ongoing climate crisis, the site boasts a collection of more than 55 million pages of literature, some of which dates back to the 15th century. At least 150,000 illustrations are available for [free download](https://about.biodiversitylibrary.org/ufaqs/how-do-i-download-an-image-from-flickr/) in high-resolution files.
> 
> Among the collections is a digital copy of Joseph Wolf’s [_The Zoological Sketches_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/150060?utm_medium=social_media&utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=Book%20of%20the%20Month&utm_content=MCZ#/summary), two volumes containing about 100 lithographs depicting wild animals housed in London’s Regent’s Park. Wolf originally sketched and painted the vignettes in the mid-19th century. Other diverse works range from [a watercolor project](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/229054?utm_medium=social%20media&utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=HerNaturalHistory&utm_content=NAL#page/9/mode/1up) detailing flowers indigenous to the Hawaiian islands, to a [guide for do-it-yourself taxidermy](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/229784?utm_medium=social%20media&utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=Book%20of%20the%20Month&utm_content=University%20of%20Toronto#page/7/mode/1up) replete with illustrated instructions published in 1833.
