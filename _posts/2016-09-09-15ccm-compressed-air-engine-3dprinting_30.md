> This engine is inspired by Tom Stantons Compressed Air Engine.  
> But with some small changes. Toms engine has about 2.7ccm, mine has about 15mm capacity.  
> It has way more torque at higher pressures. I tested it with up to 16 bar (232psi). But of cause it’s less efficient, even if it runs on very low pressure too (about 0.2 bar or 3 psi). > I didn’t like the solution to glue the cylinder head to the crankcase. So in my version they are screwed with 4 M3x10 screws. Just like the cylinder head.  > It needs a heavy flywheel to run smooth. I use a 160mm rotor from a bicycle. But you can easily make your own (for dimensions take a look into the photos if you haven\`t already).

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
