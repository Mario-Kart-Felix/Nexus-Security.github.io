In another tweet, Gurman suggested the announcement will be made by Wednesday. The news would likely be shared in the form of a press release on the Apple Newsroom and would also likely coincide with early hands-on impressions of the 16-inch MacBook Pro from select media outlets and YouTube channels.  
  
  
  
  
  

> It’s this week - that’s imminent from two weeks ago.

> Only question remaining from multiple folks: is the announcement tomorrow (briefings day) or Wednesday (when review embargoes lift)? Also, 24 hours for a review seems like so little time, so I’d hope the stories are framed as “previews” or “first looks.”

[_9to5Mac_](https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/11/16-inch-macbook-pro-hands-on-event/) recently reported that Apple appears to be holding private press briefings of some kind at its luxury loft mansion in New York City this week, likely to facilitate those 16-inch MacBook Pro first impressions. Multiple out-of-town tech reporters have tweeted that they are in or headed to New York City over the last few days.  
  
  
  
  
  
Rumors suggest the 16-inch MacBook Pro will feature slimmer bezels around the display, a more reliable [scissor switch keyboard](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/25/kuo-16-inch-macbook-pro-scissor-keyboard/), [a standalone Touch ID sensor](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/30/16-inch-macbook-pro-touch-bar-layout/), and [possibly a much-requested physical Esc key](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/16-inch-macbook-pro-possibly-referenced-in-macos-catalina-10-15-1-beta.2206447/post-27888304). Pricing is unknown, but would likely be higher than the $2,799 high-end 15-inch MacBook Pro.  
  
  
  
  
  
For what it's worth, [15-inch MacBook Pro models with AMD Radeon Pro Vega graphics options](https://www.macrumors.com/2018/11/14/macbook-pro-vega-graphics-available/) became available to order on the Wednesday of this week a year ago, along with a [(PRODUCT)RED version of the Apple Watch Sport Loop](https://www.macrumors.com/2018/11/14/apple-watch_productred-sport-loop/). Apple also launched its annual [holiday gift guide](https://www.macrumors.com/2018/11/14/apple-holiday-2018-gift-guide/) on the same day.
