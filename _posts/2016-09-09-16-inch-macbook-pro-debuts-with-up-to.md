Apple today released its much-rumored high-end 16-inch [MacBook Pro](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/), which is the largest ‌MacBook Pro‌ that's been offered for sale since the discontinuation of the 17-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌.

The updated 16-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ features slimmer bezels and a larger, brighter display than the 15-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌, which it is replacing.  
  
  
  
  
  
There's an updated keyboard that does away with the unpopular butterfly mechanism, returning instead to a more reliable scissor mechanism, along with Intel's latest processors.
