The previous 15-inch MacBook Pro included an 87W USB-C power adapter in the box.  
  
  
  
  
  
Apple says the 16-inch MacBook Pro uses the "most advanced thermal architecture ever in a Mac notebook" to enable the system to run at higher power for sustained periods of time. The notebook also features a redesigned fan with a larger impeller, extended blades, and bigger vents for a 28 percent increase in airflow.  
  
  
  
  
  
Apple adds that the 16-inch MacBook Pro can ultimately sustain up to 12 more watts during intensive workloads than the previous 15-inch model.  
  
  
  
  
  
The new 96W USB-C Power Adapter is [also sold separately on Apple.com](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MX0J2AM/A/96w-usb-c-power-adapter) for $79.
