The new 16-inch MacBook Pro [replaces the 15-inch MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch), which has been discontinued. It is possible the 15-inch model will appear in Apple's clearance store at some point, but it is not available at this time.  
  
  
  
  
  
The new 16-inch MacBook Pro starts at $2,399 in the United States, consistent with the former 15-inch MacBook Pro. A maxed-out 16-inch MacBook Pro with a 2.4GHz 8â€‘core Core i9 processor, 64GB of RAM, 8TB of SSD storage, and AMD Radeon Pro 5500M graphics runs $6,099 on Apple's online store.
