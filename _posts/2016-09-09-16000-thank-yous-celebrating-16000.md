Together as a community, we reached over 16,000+ humans thank you! We share projects, coordinate events, make new friends, build open-source together like CircuitPython, we’ve worked really hard to make this a special place for everyone to share their projects, code, and things they make.

Join today! [https://adafru.it/discord](https://adafru.it/discord)

Thank you everyone!
