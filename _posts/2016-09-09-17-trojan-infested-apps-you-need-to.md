Just like the ancient Greek story, where soldiers sneak into the gates of troy by hiding inside a wooden horse similarly Trojans sneak in your phone in the face of harmless apps that you voluntarily install. Apple users are being warned about such apps, to check their devices against a list of malware apps and delete them according to a report by Wandera.  
  
Research team at Wandera, a software-as-a-service firm, has identified 17 apps that install malicious Trojan module on iOS devices. Apple says that the infected apps have been removed from the app store but after examination they found that the apps did not contain the claimed Trojan malware. Instead, the apps were removed because of being adware specifically called the "clicker Trojan malware" and included code that enabled artificial click-through of add and made it seem like you viewed an advertisement which is against App Store's guidelines. Apple further said that the protective tools of App Store have been updated to detect such apps.  
  
 **Below is the list of infected apps:**  
  
RTO Vehicle Information  
EMI Calculator & Loan Planner  
File Manager - Documents  
Smart GPS Speedometer  
CrickOne - Live Cricket Scores  
Daily Fitness - Yoga Poses  
FM Radio PRO - Internet Radio  
My Train Info - IRCTC & PNR​ (not listed under developer profile)  
Around Me Place Finder  
Easy Contacts Backup Manager  
Ramadan Times 2019  
Pro Restaurant Finder - Find Food  
BMI Calculator PRO - BMR Calc  
Dual Accounts Pro  
Video Editor - Mute Video  
Islamic World PRO - Qibla  
Smart Video Compressor  
  
The developer of these is AppAspect Technologies, from India with apps for iOS as well as Android. Wandera said that on examining these apps, they didn't contain the clicker Trojan malware but they used too. Covington thinks it's a possibility that they used to contain Trojan but were pulled from the store, and republished after removing the Trojan module, perhaps the bust on Play store made them retreat and focus their attention on iOS.  
  
According to Wandera, the Trojan not only performed adware but also steal information and data to send to external command or controller, create back-doors, performance degradation, battery drain and heavy bandwidth use. The fact that they published on App Store and remained undetected is alone a matter of concern. “We were amazed with this one,” Wandera VP Michael Covington said in a statement to Forbes. “We've seen a couple of issues creep into the Apple App Store over the last few months—and it always seems to be the network element.”  
  
Apple stands it's ground that any such Trojan malware existed, saying there was no danger beyond ad click-through fraud. But the good news is, the problem is solved on deleting the apps and no remains are left behind. “There is no access to special frameworks that might have left something behind,” Covington explained.
