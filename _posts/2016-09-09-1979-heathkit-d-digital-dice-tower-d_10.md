> This is a revision of the previous 1978 “Heathkit” D&D Digital Dice Tower project. In this revision, I’ll attempt to simplify the build process, add some features, and subsequently update the list of components and source code.
> 
> The content I’ll be adding here assumes you’re at least familiar with the previous project. So if you haven’t already, check out the link in the paragraph above.
> 
> Just like the original project, this is based on a 1975 Bell & Howell Digital Mulitmeter.
