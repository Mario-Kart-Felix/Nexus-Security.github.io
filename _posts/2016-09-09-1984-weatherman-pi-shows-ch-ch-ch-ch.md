When \[MisterM\]’s MIL gave him a rad 80s portable cassette player, he jumped for joy. Once he figured out the window was exactly the same size as the standard for Raspberry Pi HATs, the possibilities left him reeling. A flurry of ideas later, he settled on [a weather display featuring a Pimoroni Unicorn HAT HD](http://kyliemander.com/blog/2019/12/03/new-project-the-1984-weatherman-pi/).

It shows the current weather conditions as animations, scrolls the temperature, and gives a nice graph of rainfall probability.

Surprisingly, the dazzling display isn’t our favorite part. See those spongy headphones up top? They’re not just for decoration, though they go a long way in helping the cassette player keep its identity. Whenever there’s a change in the weather, they shimmy back and forth on a 9g servo. If the servo were continuous, it might be neat to use them as a weather vane.

Be sure to check out \[MisterM\]’s comprehensive demo/build video waiting for you on the B-side. We love a good weather display around here, and [the more colorful and literal](https://hackaday.com/2019/06/12/ikea-cloud-lamp-displays-the-weather-with-esp8266/), the better.
