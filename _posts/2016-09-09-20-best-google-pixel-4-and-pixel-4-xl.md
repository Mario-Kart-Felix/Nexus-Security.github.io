Without getting into the debate  on whether or not Pixel 4/4 XL has taken away the sheen from Galaxy Note 10/10 Plus or iPhone 11 Series, I would say that Google’s latest flagship smartphones stand out on many fronts. The newest Pixel smartphones have arguably the best camera and the fastest face unlock. And with the innovative Soli radar chip that tracks motion on a microscopic scale to recognize gesture-based controls along with an impressive display with 90Hz max refresh rate, the Pixel devices have got the goods to be notable in the seemingly cut-throat market. So, if you have ordered a Pixel 4 or Pixel 4 XL and are on the lookout for some suitable accessories for your brand new Pixel smartphone, this extensive assortment of the best Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL accessories has got you fully covered.

The rugged construction (PC and TPU combo) armed with air-cushion technology is designed to take on beating.

### 4\. VeeR Falcon

  

It’s indeed sad to know that both Google Pixel 4 and 4 XL don’t support Google’s Daydream VR. Moreover, the search giant has also announced that it will no longer sell the Daydream View headsets. However, the Daydream app will continue to support older Pixel devices. But don’t worry, there are tons of VR headsets that can let you **enjoy 360-degree movies** in their full glory. And for this purpose, I have found VeeR Falcon up to the mark. The headset has a modern design and comes with **built-in HiFi active noise canceling technology**. Moreover, VeeR Falcon is lightweight and fully adjustable so that you can wear them for hours. Besides, it’s priced at just $45.99 which makes it a great affordable choice.

Another must-have accessory for fitness freaks! An armband is what you need to keep your Pixel smartphone securely placed during rigorous exercise or intense jogging. It also ensures you can comfortably interact with your device and keep a track of messages and alerts during exercise. Being **skin-friendly and breathable**, VUP is one of the best armbands for Pixel 4 and 4 XL. Made of lycra and neoprene material, the armband is soft and lightweight. Plus, the open design along with a **180-degree rotatable holder** allows you to use your device conveniently – without having to take a break from your exercise.

Best Wireless Charger, Car Charger, Car Mount and Power Bank for Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

### 1\. Anker PowerWave Wireless Charging Stand

  

Anker produces arguably the best charging accessories. So, missing out on its top-notch wireless charging stand would be a blunder.

### 2\. Belkin Boost Up Wireless Charging Pad

  

If Anker claims to be the leader, Belkin is not behind in the race either. And should you think of buying an efficient wireless charging pad, Belkin Boost Up would make a truly premium choice. The wireless charging pad is **lightweight and sports a small form-factor**. With the non-slip surface, your smartphone stays steady on the pad. As for charging efficiency, it can deliver up to **10W speed** which puts in the top-tier segment. Around $40 price tag may seem a touch high but given the premium built and safe charging, Boost Up seems to be a good buy.

### 3\. Cluvox

  

A car charger comes in super handy when you want to power up your smartphone fast and securely during a long drive. If you are willing to get an **ultra-portable car charger**, I would recommend you to take a close look at Cluvox. The company claims that the charger can power up compatible devices **4x faster.** With two USB ports and a durable Type C cable, it’s fully equipped to charge multiple devices simultaneously. Despite being compact, it’s quite durable thanks to the multi-annular design.

### 5\. Tranmix Power Banks

  

Never forget to pick up a solid power bank before going for a long journey. With plenty of battery in the tank, it can keep your smartphone powered up so that you can spend less time charging your device and more time on recording awesome videos or snapping memorable pics during a trip. And for this purpose, I think Tranmix power bank is a great option. The **25000mAh battery** along with 4 foldable solar panels up to 6W make it an indispensable travel accessory for your Pixel 4 and 4 XL. What’s more, the external charger has a rugged design and is also **waterproof**.

Best Camera Lens and Selfie Stick for Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL
------------------------------------------------------------

  

### 1\. Moment – Superfish Lens

  

Despite having a square camera bump just like iPhone 11 Pro, Pixel 4 and the bigger sibling 4 XL features only two rear cameras: a 12-megapixel main camera with f/1.7 wide-angle lens and the new f/2.4 “telephoto” camera with a 16-megapixel sensor. What it doesn’t have is an ultra-wide-angle camera which would have been a great addition. But there is no need to be disappointed as you can fill up the void using **a powerful camera lens** like this one from Moment. The **superfish lens with a 170-degree field of view** can let you capture ultra-wide shots. You can use it to snap the pics of real estate, architecture and action sports. At $99.99, the superfish lens may seem expensive but given quality, it’s a reasonable deal.

### 2\. Fugetek Selfie Stick Tripod

  

Capturing awesome group photos becomes quite easy when you have a selfie stick. And if that stick also doubles as a tripod then you have a perfect accessory for shooting fun-loving videos and amazing photos. If you want an **all-in-one selfie stick** for your new Pixel smartphone, you shouldn’t look beyond Fugetek. What headlines for this modern-looking selfie stick is the **51″ length** which could be nice for snapping wide-angle pics. The non-skid feet endows it more stability, while the **universal thumbscrew mount** offers desired flexibility. And with the Bluetooth remote at the disposal, it’s incredibly easy to capture shots – without the last moment shakes.
