In a world of [Netflix, Prime Video](https://beebom.com/amazon-prime-video-vs-netflix/), and [other streaming services](https://beebom.com/best-streaming-service/) our way of watching movies has changed. Today we all have a smart TV in our living room to watch the latest movies and TV shows. Traditional TV channels and [cable have given way to streaming platforms](https://beebom.com/best-cable-alternatives/) containing a wide variety of content including both popular and Oscar nominated movies.
