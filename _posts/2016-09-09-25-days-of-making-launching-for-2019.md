[Aaron Maurer](https://twitter.com/aaronmaureredu) is again leading [25 Days of Making](https://sites.google.com/view/25-days-of-making/home) this year.

> Dear all my maker friends,
> 
> Almost one year ago we completed the first edition of [25 days of making](https://sites.google.com/view/25daysofmaking/home). It was an incredible experience of many people sharing some wonderful maker projects on their own time. Each day for 25 days(we ended up with 30 in all) we unveiled a new project for you to make and do with your students or perhaps just yourself.
> 
> Last year I had zero intentions of doing it again. It was a lot of work and a lot of fun, but just something of an experiment. However, I have continued to get requests for another round and I could not say no.
> 
> **The 2019 edition will start soon!**
> 
> Here are three things for you to know as we prepare behind the scenes for another 25 days of making.
> 
> 1\. Head to the new 2019[ 25 Days of Making Website and watch the intro video](https://sites.google.com/view/25-days-of-making/home) (below).
> 
> 2. [Sign up for the newsletter to get emails](https://sites.google.com/view/25-days-of-making/home) for the project when it begins.
> 
> 3\. I need a few more makers to round out the projects this year. If you would like to share a project or know of someone, please let me know. We are in the planning and development stages right now so I want to make sure everyone is ready to go come December.
> 
> Let me know your thoughts, let me know if interested in sharing a project, and I cannot wait to start this up again in about a month.
> 
> All right, back to the work and making.
