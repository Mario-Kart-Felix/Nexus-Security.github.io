For quite a long while now, latitude and longitude has been the way humankind has navigated the globe. This is a perfectly workable system, but it’s a little overwrought for daily use by the layperson. [What3Words seeks to provide a simpler solution.](https://what3words.com/)

The system is based on splitting the surface of the globe into a grid of 3 m x 3 m sections. This includes oceans and bodies of water. With the grid layed out, each section is given a name consisting of three English words strung together. For example, [///eggs.form.breakfast](https://what3words.com/eggs.form.breakfast) denotes a spot in the outskirts of Chengdu, China, while [///crops.cards.gifts](https://what3words.com/crops.cards.gifts) is a good approximation of that spot where [the Naked Cowboy hangs out in Times Square, New York.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_Cowboy#/media/File:Naked_Cowboy_on_Times_Square.jpg)

Addresses in this format are written with three leading forward slashes, along with a dot between each word. An attempt has been made to only use uncontroversial words, as well as to make sure no crude addresses are created by awkward combinations. Don’t worry, we checked – but if you do find anything good, drop it in the comments below.

It’s a tool that’s been around for a while, but an interesting one nonetheless. It’s something that needs a wider societal acceptance to become truly useful; we imagine it could be good in a small social circle once everyone is familiar with it. It may yet catch on – only time will tell!
