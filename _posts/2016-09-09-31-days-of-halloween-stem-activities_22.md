> Halloween is the perfect time for some fun and engaging STEM activities. There are just so many activities that capture a child’s interest and imagination during this season, and so many of them are perfect for our young scientists! We love Halloween around here and to celebrate I’m planning 31 days of Halloween STEM Activities countdown to Halloween. Join us on our Halloween STEM adventure!
> 
> I’ve gathered up over 31 science, tech, engineering and math activities that are going to make the countdown to Halloween amazing for your children! Most of these activities are meant for elementary aged children, approximately 8 to 12 years old. Enjoy these spectacularly spooky STEM Halloween projects!

> 
> **[Spider Web Vibrations Science](https://buggyandbuddy.com/spider-web-science-activity-for-kids/)** – Spiders are always popular at this time of year, so why not make a giant spider web and learn a bit about how spiders use vibrations?
