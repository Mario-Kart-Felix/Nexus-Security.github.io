Windowless skyscraper in Manhattan, New York

**33 Thomas Street** (formerly the **AT&T Long Lines Building**) is a 550-foot-tall (170 m) skyscraper in [Civic Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_Center,_Manhattan "Civic Center, Manhattan"), [Lower Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Manhattan "Lower Manhattan"), [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City"). It stands on the east side of [Church Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Street_(Manhattan) "Church Street (Manhattan)"), between Thomas Street and [Worth Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worth_Street "Worth Street"). The building is an example of the [Brutalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture "Brutalist architecture") architectural style. It is a [telephone exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_exchange "Telephone exchange") or wire center building which contained three major [4ESS switches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4ESS_switch "4ESS switch") used for [interexchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interexchange_carrier "Interexchange carrier") ([long distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_distance_calling "Long distance calling")) telephony, as well as a number of other switches used for [competitive local exchange carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_local_exchange_carrier "Competitive local exchange carrier") services. However, it is not used for [incumbent local exchange carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent_local_exchange_carrier "Incumbent local exchange carrier") services, and is not a central office. The [CLLI code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLLI_code "CLLI code") for this facility is NYCMNYBW. The building has also been described as the likely location of a [National Security Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency "National Security Agency") (NSA) [mass surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance "Mass surveillance") hub codenamed TITANPOINTE.

History
-------

The location was previously the site of [cast-iron buildings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast-iron_architecture "Cast-iron architecture"), typical of the area, the [facades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facades "Facades") of which were preserved prior to demolition.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Thomas_Street#cite_note-gridlock-1) The building was a core part of the [AT&T Long Lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T_Long_Lines "AT&T Long Lines") Department, housing [solid-state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_state_(electronics) "Solid state (electronics)") switching equipment which required a high level of security and space. The Long Lines Department became AT&T Communications in 1984, after the [Bell System divestiture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_System_divestiture "Bell System divestiture"). The AT&T Long Lines Building is now commonly known by its street address, 33 Thomas St., like many major New York City commercial buildings.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Thomas_Street#cite_note-2)

AT&T gradually transitioned switches and other facilities from their former AT&T Long Lines headquarters building at [32 Sixth Avenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32_Avenue_of_the_Americas "32 Avenue of the Americas"), just a few blocks away, completing the move by 1999.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Thomas_Street#cite_note-3) 33 Thomas is still used for telephone switching, but some of the space is also used as highly secure [datacenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datacenter "Datacenter") space.

On September 17, 1991, management failure, power equipment failure, and human error combined to completely disable AT&T's central office switch at 33 Thomas. As a result, over 5 million calls were blocked, and [Federal Aviation Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration "Federal Aviation Administration") private lines were also interrupted, disrupting [air traffic control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_control "Air traffic control") to 398 airports serving most of the northeastern United States. Because the building was designed to be self-sufficient, AT&T had a [load shedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_shedding "Load shedding") agreement with the [electric utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_utility "Electric utility"), [Consolidated Edison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Edison "Consolidated Edison"), where they would voluntarily switch from utility power to on-site generators on request. This was a routine procedure that had been performed successfully in the past, but on this occasion, it went wrong. After switching power sources, standard procedure was to check all the equipment power supplies, known as DC plants, for problems. But due to scheduled training, the check was not performed, and one plant went on battery backup. The alarms were not detected until it was too late to maintain uninterrupted power.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Thomas_Street#cite_note-4)

After the destruction of the [World Trade Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_(1973-2001) "World Trade Center (1973-2001)") in the [September 11, 2001 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11,_2001_attacks "September 11, 2001 attacks"), AT&T Local Services restored lost facilities they acquired from the former [Teleport Communications Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleport_Communications_Group "Teleport Communications Group") based there, to 33 Thomas and 811 10th Avenue.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Thomas_Street#cite_note-5)

The Long Lines Building was designed by architect [John Carl Warnecke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carl_Warnecke "John Carl Warnecke") and completed in 1974. As it was built to house [telephone switching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_switching "Telephone switching") equipment, the average floor height is 18 feet (5.5 m), considerably taller than in an average high-rise. The floors are also unusually strong, designed to carry 200-to-300-pound-force-per-square-foot (9.6 to 14.4 kPa) [live loads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_load "Live load").[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Thomas_Street#cite_note-6)

The exterior walls have no windows (other than the entrance) and are made from precast concrete panels clad with flame-treated textured Swedish [granite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granite "Granite") faces. There are six large protrusions from the rectangular base which house air ducts, stairs and elevators. There is a series of large, protruding ventilation openings on the 10th and 29th floors.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Thomas_Street#cite_note-7)[William H. Whyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Whyte "William H. Whyte") claimed that it features the tallest blank wall in the world.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Thomas_Street#cite_note-8)[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Thomas_Street#cite_note-aia4-9)

It is often described as one of the most secure buildings in America, and was designed to be self-sufficient with its own gas and water supplies along with generation capabilities and protected from [nuclear fallout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fallout "Nuclear fallout") for up to two weeks after a nuclear blast.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Thomas_Street#cite_note-gridlock-1) Its style has been generally praised, with _[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")_ saying it is a rare building of its type in Manhattan that "makes sense architecturally" and that it "blends into its surroundings more gracefully" than any other skyscraper nearby.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Thomas_Street#cite_note-10)

The building is a [telephone exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_exchange "Telephone exchange") or wire center building which contained three major [4ESS switches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4ESS_switch "4ESS switch")[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Thomas_Street#cite_note-Morris-11) used for [interexchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interexchange_carrier "Interexchange carrier") ([long distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_distance_calling "Long distance calling")) telephony, two owned by [AT&T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T "AT&T")[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Thomas_Street#cite_note-12)[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Thomas_Street#cite_note-13) and one formerly owned by [Verizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon "Verizon") (decommissioned in 2009).[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Thomas_Street#cite_note-14) It also contains a number of other switches used for [competitive local exchange carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_local_exchange_carrier "Competitive local exchange carrier") services,[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Thomas_Street#cite_note-15) but is not used for [incumbent local exchange carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent_local_exchange_carrier "Incumbent local exchange carrier") services, and is not a central office.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Thomas_Street#cite_note-Morris-11) The [CLLI code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLLI_code "CLLI code") for this facility is NYCMNYBW.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Thomas_Street#cite_note-16)

33 Thomas was described as the likely location of a [NSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency "National Security Agency") [mass surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance "Mass surveillance") hub codenamed TITANPOINTE.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Thomas_Street#cite_note-intercept-17) In an investigation by _[The Intercept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intercept "The Intercept")_, and in a documentary short film by [Henrik Moltke](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Moltke_(journalist) "de:Henrik Moltke (journalist)") and [Laura Poitras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Poitras "Laura Poitras") titled _Project X,_ both drawing on the [surveillance disclosures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present) "Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)") of [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden "Edward Snowden"). The investigation ties the facility to a nearby [FBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation "Federal Bureau of Investigation") building, and its rooftop equipment to NSA's SKIDROWE satellite intelligence system.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Thomas_Street#cite_note-18)[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Thomas_Street#cite_note-intercept-17)
