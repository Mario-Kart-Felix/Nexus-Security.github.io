Thermal inserts are a big thing when it comes to engineering with plastic. They make it easy to use threaded fasteners with plastic parts, and they work great with 3D printing too. There’s a bit of a knack to installing them without damaging your workpiece, however, and \[John Culbertson\] wanted to make using them as easy as possible. Thus, [he created a thermal insert press of his very own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEdtyCNJDfY)!

If you’re not using heat-set inserts with your 3D printed parts you’re missing out. Hackaday’s own \[Joshua Vasquez\] wrote [a great guide on thermal inserts](https://hackaday.com/2019/02/28/threading-3d-printed-parts-how-to-use-heat-set-inserts/) which you heat up to securely melt the plastic as they are pushed into a slightly under-sized hole. While it’s possible to install these inserts by hand, using a press means much more consistent results.

This press relies on 3D printed components in combination with off-the-shelf bearings and fasteners. There’s a linear rail as well, to give the soldering iron a  clean, smooth downward motion. This helps make sure that the inserts go in straight and true, first time, every time. We’ve seen other DIY builds before, [like this modified arbor press that gets the job done](https://hackaday.com/2015/03/06/diy-thermal-insert-press/).
