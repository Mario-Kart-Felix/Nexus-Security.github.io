If you don’t get enough driving in your real life, you can top it off with some virtual driving and even build yourself a cockpit. To this end \[Noctiluxx\] created a very nice [3D printable stick shifter](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1274947) you can build yourself.

The design is adapted for 3D printing from an older [aluminium version](https://www.xsimulator.net/community/threads/diy-h-shifter-by-willynovi-working.2323/) by \[Willynovi\] over on the X-Simulator forums. Every version uses an off-the-shelf ball joint for the main pivot, below which is a guide plate with the desired shift pattern.  Each position has a microswitch, which can be connected to a USB encoder from eBay which acts as a HID. The position is held in the Y-axis position by a clever spring-loaded cam mechanism above the ball joint, while the X-position is held by the bottom guide plate. The gear knob can be either 3D printed or the real deal of your choice.

This design is the perfect example of the power of the internet and open source. The original aluminium design is almost a decade old, but has been built and modified by a number of people over the years to get us to the easy to build version we see today. \[amstudio\] created an excellent video tutorial  on how to built your own, see it after the break.
