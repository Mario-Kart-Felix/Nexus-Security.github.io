> It’s that spooky time of year again so I decided to riff on the jack-o-lantern project I did last year and model up a big ghost to 3D print. Add-in some PWM LED eyes and you have a super simple spooky project.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
