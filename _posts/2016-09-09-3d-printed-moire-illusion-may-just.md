Moiré illusions can be visually captivating, particularly when a little rotational motion is thrown in the mix. \[Dushyant Ahuja\] was a fan of these moving Moiré sculptures he’d seen around the place, [and decided to create his own.](https://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printed-Moire-Illusion/)

The build is based around spinning two spoked discs in opposite directions, such that the spokes create moving Moiré patterns as they turn. To achieve this, the discs were 3D printed, along with a central housing containing two 12 volt gear motors. 3D printed gears are used to allow both discs to rotate about the same axis. Nominally, the motors spin relatively slowly, generating a pleasing, hypnotic effect when turning the discs.

The drivetrain is under the control of an ESP8266, though \[Dushyant\] notes that to get the basic effect, one need only connect the motors to a 12 volt power supply and let them run. However, future plans involve adding some LEDs for bling, and varying the motor speed to create yet more complex effects. With the microcontroller already installed, upgrades should be a cinch.

Moiré effects are good for everything from [guiding ships](https://hackaday.com/2018/04/07/using-moire-patterns-to-guide-ships/) to [taking precision measurements.](https://hackaday.com/2018/03/07/0-05-mm-precision-thats-a-moire/) If you’ve found a new application for these confounding line patterns, [be sure to let us know!](http://HACKADAY.COM/SUBMIT-A-TIP) Video after the break.
