From splat238 on [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/RGB-LED-Pixel-Shades/):

> Originally I created these to wear around the house at Christmas / New Years, sort of as a mobile ornament, but they ended up being a bit more cyberpunk than I anticipated, so they should be fun to wear at other events too!
