Traditionally, we buy wedding rings (or any rings) made from metals like silver or gold. But hard metal rings are uncomfortable during exercise and potentially dangerous in a shop or when you fall. Here are the best silicone ring alternatives.

If you wear metal rings on your fingers often, you might remember how uncomfortable and noticeable they were when you first started wearing them. Rings can be cumbersome, constricting, and for some people, they may cause allergic reactions.

Worse yet, metal rings come with dangers, especially if you take a fall or work with your hands in a gym or shop. Just ask Jimmy Fallon, who had to take two weeks off from the Tonight Show after tripping on a rug.

As he fell, he tried to catch himself and ended pulling his finger off his hand. It’s an injury called ring avulsion. In many cases, the only option is to cut the finger off.

As horrible as that is, rings can cause an even more atrocious injury. In some cases, all the layers of the skin are pulled off the finger, leaving behind just the bones, muscle, and connective tissue. That’s called a finger degloving, and unless you want nightmare fuel, you’re better off not Googling it.

Silicone rings are a great alternative to metal rings for several reasons. They’re far less expensive than a silver or gold ring, and they’ll break under 40 pounds of pressure (in some cases less). That breaking point makes them safer than metal rings (though no ring is still the safest option).

If you have any skin allergies, silicone rings are hypoallergenic and shouldn’t cause you issues unless you are specifically allergic to silicone. They’re also very lightweight and flexible, which means they can be very comfortable. If you know what you’re looking for, you can find silicone rings so comfortable you forget they’re even there.

What to Look For in a Silicone Ring
-----------------------------------

Type Silicone Ring into an Amazon search, and you’ll get dozens and dozens of results. You may even be surprised by the broad variety price points, ranging from $15 for a multi-pack to $30 for a single ring.
