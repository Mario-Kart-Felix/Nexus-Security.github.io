Let’s start our article with one of the most under-rated and a gem of a movie produced by Bollywood which is The Lunchbox. The story of Lunchbox revolves around an Indian housewife and an older man. The movie starts with a simple premise. **What if the critically acclaimed Mumbai Dabbawala misplaced a lunchbox?** With this simple hook, we are led into a story which is full of love, family, and emotions and takes you on a journey that you will never be able to forget. What happens you ask? Well, you will have to watch the movie to find out, won’t you? The Lunchbox is one of the best Netflix hindi movies to watch.

2\. Queen (2014)
----------------

  

One of my favorite Hindi movies of all time is Queen. The story revolves around a traditional family girl who has never set her foot out of her comfort zone and now decided to tour Europe on her own. What forces her to take this step and what happens afterward is the whole story of the movie. The [movie is hilarious](https://beebom.com/best-comedy-movies-on-netflix/) and sad at the same time. **Kangana Ranawat who plays the lead character Rani has killed with her performance in this movie**. This is one Netflix Hindi movie that you won’t regret watching.

3\. Manto (2018)
----------------

  

Manto is the **life story of controversial and troubled Indo-Pakistani writer Sadat Hussain Manto**. The story focuses on the artistic and censorship challenges faced by the writers while he was creating his work. The main character Manto is being played by ever awesome Nawazuddin Siddiqui and might I say it is his one of the best performances yet. The plot is gripping and will hold you till the last minute. I enjoyed watching this movie a lot and highly recommend to all Netflix viewers.

While Hollywood is full of great con movies, it’s something that Bollywood has never been able to get right, that is until Special 26 hit the theaters. Starring Akshay Kumar, t**he movie revolves around a con man and his team who pose as CBI and Income Tax officers** to rob prominent rich businessmen and politicians who are evading tax. If you love con movies and are looking for good Netflix Hindi movies, you are going to love this one.

----------------------------

  

Released in 2017, Bareilly ki Barfi is a movie which will tickle your funny bones in all the right places. Boasting of a talented star cast including Ayushmann Khurrana, Kriti Sanon, Rajkummar Rao, and my favorite Pankaj Tripathi, **the story revolves around Bitti who is a free-spirited small-town girl who lives her life on her own terms**. What happens to her when she meets Chirag Dubey (Ayushman) and Pritam Vidrohi (Rajkumar Rao) is the whole movie. This one is an entertainment bomb.

Based on the Malyalam super hit movie of the same name, **Drishyam is a story about  a man who will do anything to save his family.** Ajay Devan plays the lead character and he has killed with his performance in this role.

-----------------------

  

This is one of my all-time favorite movies of Bollywood. The movie marks a height in Indian cinema which is rarely achieved. The story is about a common man who is fed up with terrorist attacks and decides to do something himself. **It features two of the biggest actors of Indian cinema; Naseeruddin Shah and Anupam Kher and puts them against each other**.

14\. Bahubali (2015) and Bahubali 2 (2017)
------------------------------------------

  

Bahubali and its sequel Bahubali 2 are probably the most hyped movies of India and deservedly so. No movie has ended on such a cliffhanger as Bahubali. **The period drama featuring Prabhas has been directed by the critically acclaimed, S.S. Rajamouli**. While this is not technically a Bollywood movie, it was made in collaboration with Dharma Production, and I had to include it on this list.

------------------------

  

I had stopped expecting good movies from Shahrukh Khan after Chennai express and I was mostly right. However, the release of Dear Zindagi changed all that. **Seeing Shahrukh in a story driven plot is something of an anomaly these days and hence Dear Zindagi is a must watch**. Propelled by a gripping storyline and great performances from Alia Bhatt and Shahrukh Khan, this is a movie that you don’t want to miss.

-----------------------

  

Another great Netflix Hindi movie, Madras Cafe is an action thriller movie which showcases the journey of an Indian intelligence agent to a war-torn coastal island to break a resolute rebel group and meet a passionate journalist. **The movie stars John Abraham and it is probably his best performance in any movie.** He is not just a pile of muscle and shows that if given good a script, he can act too.

If Gurgaon didn’t succeed in dwindling your faith in humanity, Anurag Kashayp’s 2013 thriller Ugly will.

31\. Dangal (2016)
------------------

  

I don’t think there are too many Bollywood sports films that are as memorable as Dangal. Mr. perfectionist “Aamir Khan” has excelled in his role as a **former wrestler (Mahavir Singh)** who pursues the gold medal he never won by training his two strong-willed daughters named Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari. Set in the Indian state of Haryana, the film is loosely **based on the Phogat family** and its tryst with the coveted medals at the Commonwealth Games. Beyond the story, Pritam’s music and Amitabh Bhattacharya’s lyrics are also worthy of praise.

32\. Motichoor Chaknachoor (2019)
---------------------------------

  

Though Motichoor Chaknachoor couldn’t rock the box-office, it has got all sorts of ingredients to be a notable pick. The movie is **about a 36-year-old man “Pushpinder Tyagi”** (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) who is working in Dubai. Tyagi is desperately trying to find a girl to marry back home in Bhopal. During the hunt of a suitable wife, he meets a much younger neighbor Anita (Athiya Shetty) who is willing to **marry someone settled abroad**. Though Nawazuddin has performed his role quite well, it’s Athiya who is kind of stolen the show.

33\. Force 2 (2016)
-------------------

  

For filling your showtime with plenty of hardcore action, you can’t go wrong with Force 2. It’s the **sequel to the 2011 Force film** that had done exceedingly well on the silver screen. Starring John Abraham as ACP Yashwardhan, this action thriller is about **a brave police offers who teams up with a RAW agent** to expose an inside informer who leaks sensitive information to a foreign agency. Apart from raw action scenes, the movie also shows nice chemistry between John and Sonakshi Sinha, the leading lady of the movie.

34\. Bhool Bhulaiyaa (2007)
---------------------------

  

Bhool Bhulaiyaa is the sort of movie that you will enjoy watching time and again. This **comedy horror film is an official remake of the 1993 Malayalam film Manichitrathazhu.** The movie is about an NRI and his wife who decide to live in an ancestral house ignoring the warnings about ghosts. And when unexpected things start taking place, he has to take the help of a psychiatrist (Akshay Kumar) to solve the mystery. Due mainly to the fascinating story, the film **received universal critical acclaim** and also proved to be a massive hit. Moreover, Vidya Balan’s performance is considered one of her best.

35\. Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran (2018)
-----------------------------------------

  

For the folks who are on the lookout for a scintillating **historical action drama film**, “Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran” appears to be a fine bet. The film is directed by Abhishek Sharma and features John Abraham, Diana Penty and Boman Irani in major roles. If you haven’t already guessed it, let me tell you that it’s based on the **nuclear bomb test explosions conducted by the Indian Army** at Pokhran in 1998 during Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s government. In a nutshell, Parmanu is an ode to the amazing bravery of the Indian Army and the resolute scientists.

Judwaa 2 is a **reboot of the 1997 superhit film Judwaa** starring Salman Khan. The movie has been directed by David Dhawan and features Varun Dhawan, Jacqueline Fernandez and Taapsee Pannu in the lead roles. It follows the life of Raja and Prem **(the completely contrasting twins who were separated at birth but are connected through reflexes)** who come together as adults to fight an underground smuggling kingpin to save their family. Varun looks spot on in the dual-avatar, while Jacqueline and Taapsee have performed their parts elegantly which makes the action-comedy a nice watch. Bole to paisa vasool (worth the money you pay)!

38\. Toilet: Ek Prem Katha (2017)
---------------------------------

  

As a satirical comedy, “Toilet: Ek Prem Katha” has lived up to my billing. And rightly so as the movie is a pretty interesting **representation of government campaigns to improve sanitation conditions in India** with the sole focus on the elimination of the open defecation. With an impressive cast led by the likes of Akshay Kumar, Bhumi Pednekar, Anupam Kher, and Sudhir Pandey, the film succeeds in highlighting India’s toilet problem with a great mix of love and comedy. So, it deserves a shot in this roundup of the top Bollywood movies on Netflix.

39\. 3 Idiots (2009)
--------------------

  

No matter how many times you have streamed 3 Idiots, you may fall for it every time it’s on the horizon. So, I’m not going to miss out on this **coming-of-age comedy-drama** that’s undoubtedly one of the best Bollywood movies on Netflix. Directed by Rajkumar Hirani, the film features Aamir Khan, Madhavan, Sharman Joshi, Kareena Kapoor, and Boman Irani in major roles. As for the plot, it revolves around **three students at an Indian engineering college** giving a satirical touch to the social pressures under an Indian education system.

40\. Tamasha (2015)
-------------------

  

If a modern romantic film is what you are willing to stream, Tamasha would be my recommendation for multiple reasons. First and foremost, this movie is about **real-life ex-flames: Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone**. The film (directed by Imtiaz Ali) is set around Ved Vardhan Sahni (Ranbir) and showcases his life in three different stages: a nine-year-old child, a 19-year-old teenager, and a 30-year-old adult. With **A.R Rahman’s soundtrack** and Irshad Kamil’s lyrics, Tamasha won’t fail to touch your heart, should you have a penchant for romantic flicks.
