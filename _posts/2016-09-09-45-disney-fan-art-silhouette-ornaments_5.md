> You can resize these to whatever you like. A typical ornament is 2.5 inches.
> 
> I adjust the Z height to 3.5 or 4mm depending on how fragile the ornament might be.
> 
> Pay attention to resizing too small, so the hook will fit in your ornament. (I’ll be making hooks soon).
> 
> I like 35% infill, but that, too, can be changed to your preference.
> 
> Two of the ornaments, Pooh and Jack Skellington/Sally, are a dangling ornament. I uploaded a pic of Pooh. These are meant to have a string glued to each piece to dangle.
> 
> Thingiverse makes the files look rounded, but they are very flat.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
