If the [pro-grade camera](https://beebom.com/best-iphone-11-11-pro-11-pro-max-camera-tips/) of the iPhone 11 Series has become the talk of the town, “Night Mode” has perhaps caught the most [spotlight](https://beebom.com/spotlight-tips-tricks/). While almost every Android flagship including Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy had its own version of Night Mode for quite some time, none of them could nail it down like 2019 iPhones. Given the huge praise from both experts and shutterbugs, I can feel the enormous craving with which the users of older iPhones are willing to take some pie out of the stunning night photography. If you too want this feature, look no further than these best Night Mode camera apps for iPhone and iPad.  

Best iPhone and iPad Apps to Take Night Mode Photos
---------------------------------------------------

  

Before getting into the exploring mode, it would be apt to sort out of a few clouds that might be hanging behind the scene and also put the disclaimer away.  

### So, How Do You Take Night Mode Photos on Older iOS Devices?

  

Let’s get it out of the way upfront! No night mode app can match the repertoire of Apple’s offering. However, they can certainly please you with fairly impressive bright and crisp images captured in dark environments. How do these apps achieve such a result?  

Well, most of these night mode camera apps **first capture several frames and then merge them all together to create a single frame.** Thus, the photo that comes out appears brighter; as if it had been captured under decent light. Keep in mind, the whole process doesn’t happen in the blink of an eye. So, you will need to **hold your smartphone steadily for 10 seconds** (in some extremely dark environments, you may have to hold your iOS device even longer.)  

For the best result, ensure that your iPhone remains steady until the pic has been captured. Also, make sure the subject isn’t moving while the image is being shot. Last but not least, the **image resolution may vary based on the device you are using**. That all being said, get scrolling!  

1\. NeuralCam
-------------

  

Without any surprise what-so-ever, NeuralCam has topped our lineup of the top night mode camera apps for iPhone. I can vouch for the fairly impressive performance of this camera app because I [have put it to an acid test.](https://beebom.com/how-get-night-mode-older-iphones-iphone-xs-xr-iphone-8/) So, how does this app deliver such a good result consistently?  

![NeuralCam](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2-3.jpg)

Well, it first snaps multiple frames and then uses image processing algorithms to **merge the frames seamlessly using [machine learning.](https://beebom.com/examples-of-artificial-intelligence/)** As a result, the image looks brighter. I also love its ability to shoot ultra-wide landscape shots at night. While it can’t deliver the same result as Apple’s Night Mode, it’s worth giving a chance.  

![NeuralCam Shots ](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1-2.jpg)Interface-wise, NeuralCam has kept everything simple, making it easier to get a good hang of all the tools. Lastly, the camera app **works with both iPhone and iPad running iOS 12 or later.** As for pricing, it comes at $4.99 which I find reasonable considering the reliable performance.

2\. ProCam 7
------------

  

When you talk about the [best camera apps for the iPhone and iPad,](https://beebom.com/best-iphone-camera-apps/) the one that instantly comes to mind is “ProCam 7”. A whopping **4.5 stars out of more than 21.5K ratings** just show how well this camera app has been received by users. As for night mode photography, ProCam 7 does a pretty good job. It **brightens up the photos while still keeping the natural colors intact** (to a good extent).

Beyond night mode shots, ProCam is a fully-featured camera app. So, you can get all the bells and whistles to capture adorable selfies and normal pics. It also takes advantage of **Smart HDR or [Deep Fusion](https://beebom.com/iphone-deep-fusion-ios-13-beta/)** to deliver better results. For the folks who are fond of slofies would be glad to have slow shutter mode that supports all the available lenses like (0.5x, 1x, and 2x). As far as pricing is concerned, ProCam comes at $5.99 and works with both iPhone and iPad (iOS 11 or later). In a nutshell, it’s one of the best iPhone camera apps for night shots.  

_**Price:** [$5.99](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id730712409), in-app purchases available_  

3.NightCap Camera
-----------------

  

For capturing beautiful night photos on the iPhone, I have found NightCap up to the task. Thanks to the **long exposure, the camera app snaps brighter photos in low light.** The long exposure also plays a vital role in providing improved motion blur effects and much-reduced image noise. Powered by [AI](https://beebom.com/best-artificial-intelligence-courses-online/), the app automatically adjusts focus and exposure to capture clear shots even in dark.

If you wish to **fine-tune the settings manually, the gesture-based adjustment** will make your task quite easy. With the light trails mode, you can take better pics of fireworks and moving objects. What has caught my eyes in NightCap Camera is the **astronomy modes that capture stars and Northern lights.** If you have a liking for astrophotography, you would find the four camera modes exciting.

**The light boost feature increases the brightness of shots while ensuring that their details aren’t compromised.** And with the night reduction mode, you have the option to minimize image noise. Just like ProCam, NightCap camera also works with Apple watch so that you can get a preview and even control some major features right from your wrist.  

_**Price:** [$2.99](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id754105884)_  

4.Cortex Camera
---------------

  

Cortext Camera has been in the low-light photography game for long. So, I don’t think many of you would be surprised to see it in this lineup. The camera app has a **lightweight and intuitive interface** that can easily appeal to those who are on the lookout for a simple yet highly functional night mode apps for their older iPhones.  

![Cortex Camera ](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cortex-Camera-.jpg)

The app **works pretty well in reducing noise in low-light conditions.** Therefore, you can get clear and crisp shots in dark environments without having to use a tripod. It first combines several exposures to create a single image that is brighter and noise-free.

There are a couple of things to keep in mind. First and foremost, you must **keep your device steady** and also ensure that the subject is not moving for the duration of the exposure that normally takes around 2-10 seconds. And the second, the **image resolution entirely depends on which iOS device you are using.** For instance, the camera app delivers up to 19 megapixels on iPhone 6s/6s Plus and about 30 megapixels on iPhone 7 or later.  

_**Price:** [$2.99](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id517488939)_  

5.Night Camera HD
-----------------

  

This one might be less popular as compared to ProCam and NeuralCam but it packs a solid punch when it comes to shooting pics in dark. With the **ISO enhancements, manual setting options for light exposure, and separate residual light**, it has got all the needed tools to capture images in low-lit environments.One of my favorite features of this app is the tap to focus and tap to exposure at once. After you have chosen the preferred setting, you can choose to lock it so that it stays intact. Times when you may want to prevent the last-minute shake from destroying your night-time shots, the self-timer could come in super handy.

Another thing worth noting is the option to have **luminance, luminosity, and RGB histograms** which make it a bit easier to recognize the over and underexposure. Moreover, Night Camera HD supports iOS 8 or later that means you can get night mode even on your quite older iPhone or iPad.  

_**Price:** [$2.99](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id562160609)_
