TikTok is one of the fastest-growing social networks today, with some of the best video content you’ll see on the internet. These five websites and apps only make it better than ever before.

For the uninitiated, TikTok is a social network much like the old Vine, and similar to Instagram or Snapchat. It only supports videos, with a maximum limit of 15 seconds. You can merge multiple videos into one longer Story.

If you want to know more, check out our primer on [what is TikTok and how does it work](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-tiktok-how-does-it-work/). If you already know TikTok, jump on to the apps.

1\. [TikTokforWeb](https://tiktokforweb.com/) (Web): Unofficial Web Client for TikTok
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, TikTok is only available as a mobile app for Android and iOS. We’ve seen this before with Instagram and other social networks, where the web client is launched years later. And till then, you get third-party developers making unofficial versions like this one.

TikTokforWeb doesn’t let you sign in with your own account, so this is a generic web viewer for random TikTok Videos. You can search for an account or hashtag you already know. You can also select your country to see the top TikTok posts currently in your region.

The TikTok web viewer also allows you to watch TikTok Live channels, where users are live streaming to the masses. There is also a TikTok TV option, where you can watch a continuous stream of TikTok videos with other users in a channel.

TikTokforWeb also includes a mini-app you can use to download TikTok videos.

2\. Video Downloader for Social Media (Android): Easiest Way to Download TikTok Videos
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to download a TikTok video to your drive, perhaps to make a reaction video or make it a part of your own clip, check out the strangely named Video Downloader for Social Media by Avalon Inc. It is one of the most highly rated among thousands of other such apps on the Play Store.

The app’s claim-to-fame is that it removes the TikTok watermark from the video, so it’s easier for you to use.

Just copy-paste the link and the app does the rest. You can even download only the sound from the video to use it as a ringtone. A handy video manager tab lets you decide what to do with all the files you’ve saved.

**Download:** Video Downloader for Social Media for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tiktok.video.videodownloader&hl=en) (Free)

#### For iOS Users:

Unfortunately, this is only available for Android users and there aren’t any particularly good iPhone apps now. For now, you can use a web-based app like [TikTok Video Downloader](https://tiktokvideo.download).

It doesn’t remove the watermark, but you’ll be able to save an MP4 video to your phone or computer. TikTok videos can also be downloaded through the TikTok Lite app if you’re using that.

TikTok is still new and so it isn’t yet supported by many of the [best free all-in-one apps to download any video on the internet](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/18-free-ways-to-download-any-video-off-the-internet/). But hopefully, this should be fixed soon enough as TikTok gets more and more popular.

3\. TikTok Lite (Android): Best for Lurkers and Casual TikTok Users
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If you use TikTok to check out the videos rather than make your own, the main app is overkill. It is packed with features that you won’t use, and it drains your battery. Instead, get the official TikTok Lite app.

As with other [storage-saving lite apps for Android](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-lite-android-apps/), TikTok Lite is smaller in size. It also focuses on ensuring it uses less data than the main app, which is critical to anyone on mobile networks and not Wi-Fi. Heck, it even lets you download and save a few videos for watching them offline.

TikTok Lite is best for passive users since you don’t even need to sign in. Download the app and you can use it without a TikTok account, thus protecting your privacy a little more.

**TikTok Lite didn’t let users upload videos, but now there is an update.** When you tap the upload button, it prompts you to download a 10MB “Video” feature before being able to use it. It is a stripped-down version of the main uploader though, so we still wouldn’t recommend it for serious TikTok users.

**Download:** TikTok Lite for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zhiliaoapp.musically.go) (Free)

4\. Vizmato (Android, iOS): Best Video Editor for TikTok
--------------------------------------------------------

[![](//static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/essential-tiktok-apps-sites-Vizmato-3-310x671.png)](//static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/essential-tiktok-apps-sites-Vizmato-3.png)

[![](//static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/essential-tiktok-apps-sites-Vizmato-4-310x671.png)](//static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/essential-tiktok-apps-sites-Vizmato-4.png)

Vizmato is the best video editor for TikTok today. Even the free version is packed with enough features for you to make great videos, and the paid pro version ($11.99 / year) only adds more fun.

It covers the basics of everything you’ll need to create videos. Here’s a quick run-through of the best features available in the free version of Vizmato:

1.  Split any video, trim a video, or join multiple videos to make a single video.
2.  Select multiple photos and turn them into a slideshow video, complete with background music.
3.  Add several sound effects.
4.  Record videos through the app itself, adding music and filters live.
5.  Add popular filters to any video, and video effects like ripples, shocks, transitions, etc.

The free version has a few limitations in the use of filters, effects, songs, and the time limit of the videos. It also adds a visual watermark at the end, but you can always trim that out in the TikTok app before you post your video.

However, if you love the free app and want to avoid all that, just buy the Pro version. It’s worth it for any serious video creator.

**Download:** Vizmato for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.globaldelight.vizmato&hl=en_IN) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vizmato-video-editor-filter/id496232649) (Free)

5\. [Hashtags for TikTok](https://tiktokhashtags.com) (Web): Hashtag Generator for TikTok
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is important to use trending hashtags and popular topics if you want to [get more fans and followers on TikTok](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/get-more-tiktok-fans-followers/). Not sure which hashtags to use? There’s an app for that.

You can easily think of one hashtag based on the video you have made. For example, if you shot a cute video of your puppy, you would tag it with #dog.

So type the word “dog” into Hashtags for TikTok to instantly generate a box of 15-20 hashtags. Tap “copy” and paste it into your new TikTok video or as its first comment.

**Think about this though:** Hashtags for TikTok is the only generator of its kind right now but doesn’t say where it is getting the data for these hashtag recommendations.

There are plenty of similar apps for Instagram though, and this app even recommends keywords that are based on hashtags for Instagram. Make of that what you will…
