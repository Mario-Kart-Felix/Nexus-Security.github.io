If you’ve been more flexible with your workout schedule over the summer, it’s time to get back to it. If you’re ready to try something new, here are five trendy workouts you should try this fall!

Aerial Yoga
-----------

Yoga and hammocks; if this doesn’t already sound amazing, I don’t know what does! The gravity-defying moves decompress your spine, improve your blood circulation, and stimulate your lymphatic system to flush toxins out of your body. Aerial yoga has quickly gained popularity over the last few years. In the beginning, it was pretty hard to find a studio with silky threads hanging from the ceiling. But today, most people would be surprised if a yoga studio didn’t offer aerial classes. You can even [buy and install your own hammock](https://antigravityfitness.com/ecom/5-antigravity-silk-hammock-kit.html)!

If this sounds interesting, but you’ve never taken a single yoga class, have no fear! Even advanced yoga practitioners and teachers are clueless about how to maneuver in the silk threads when they get in the hammock for the first time. It’s fun, exciting, different, and you can safely flip and fly around. You’ll also discover new ways to twist, bend, and extend your spine.

Give it a shot—you might absolutely love it!

Trampoline Workout

Remember when you were a kid and jumping on a trampoline was one of your favorite things to do? Well, trampoline workouts are now a popular fitness trend, so if you want to recreate that joy you felt as a kid, check it out!

In addition to being fun serotonin boosters, trampoline workouts are a full-body strengthening and conditioning challenge. It fires up your cardiovascular system, seriously works your leg muscles, and activates your core, so you can keep your balance and keep jumping. Whether it’s a 20-minute High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) sequence or a 60-minute full-body endurance session, a trampoline workout can challenge you on many levels.

Celebrity trainer [Simone De La Rue](https://www.bodybysimone.com/) swears by it.

“Bouncing helps drain the lymphatic glands and boost your immune system,” said De La Rue. “It especially protects your knees, hips, and lower back, and you are forced to use your core to stabilize so that you don’t fall off. It also challenges your coordination and skill. Over time, these add up to incredible holistic health benefits for both your body and mind.”

To quote famous hip-hop group, House of Pain, it’s time to, “Jump up, jump up, and get down.”

Bungee Workout
