Let’s have a read.

Hack #1: Set Multiple Prices Per Product 
-----------------------------------------

This one is an easy and straightforward technique.

It’s not easy for store owners to give personal attention to each and every customer but it’s easy to make them feel special. How is that? Through personalized pricing. By setting custom prices for customers or by creating pricing tiers for members you can make sure they feel valued and increase their chances of making a purchase.

Special pricing also impacts store loyalty. You’ll see customers coming back to your store because of exclusive prices.

Hack #2: Organize Flash Sales with a Countdown Timer 
-----------------------------------------------------

Sales are good. Always good. But having a smart strategy is even better. When it comes to driving people to make a purchase – a tactic that always works is **Urgency**! 

Giving people a limited time to make a decision gets them to act fast. They don’t procrastinate and take action quickly.

One day sale offers that last only a few hours, deals that are announced at the nth hour, work wonders. Couple that with a countdown timer that’s always reminding people of how little time there is left to make a purchase – and you’ve got a winning strategy.

Hack #3: Set Up Bulk Discounts 
-------------------------------

Discounts are always welcome, but rolling them out often means eating into your profits. There’s a way to beat this. Offer conditional discounts. For example, on bulk purchases. Coax a customer into ordering a larger quantity of products to avail discount.

So, such conditions could be, if they:-

*   purchase a large quantity of a single product
*   reach a certain cart value
*   choose to purchase a bundle instead of a single product

These strategies could attract regular customers as well as wholesale buyers.

Hack #4: Schedule Product Availability 
---------------------------------------

![](https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/thumbnail_large-1-1.jpg)

If there’s a factor other than urgency that affects conversion – it’s **scarcity**. Telling people there’s limited stock in-store or a few products left, pushes them to make a purchase. Think about it. If you see a sign that says “this product is available only for 24 hours” – you’d be interested in knowing more about it. It makes the product special or gives you the feeling that it’s in demand.

Scheduling helps you manage stock, gives you time to test out new products in the market and increases product demand.

Hack #5: Automate “Back In Stock” Notifications
-----------------------------------------------

![](https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/buy-800x419.png)

There are times when your product is out of stock or not available, but then still in demand. That’s when potential buyers search for a product, find it on your store, but aren’t able to buy it owing to it being unavailable for purchase.

The best thing to do is have an option using which customers can get a notification when the product becomes available. You get to capture leads in a product waitlist and send buyers a stock alert notification once the product is back in stock. 

This is an easy way to not miss out on potential buyers and sales.

**Bonus Hacks – Bundles, Subscriptions, Inquiries**, **and** Quotations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/thumbnail_large-1-3.jpg)

A lot of store owners don’t focus on recurring revenue. Whereas subscription options can be a great source of ensured month-on-month revenue. [WISDM Custom Product Boxes](https://wisdmlabs.com/assorted-bundles-woocommerce-custom-product-boxes-plugin/?ref=13) help you sell product bundles or kits on a subscription basis with WooCommerce Subscriptions.

Presale inquiries, questions about the product or price quote requests are a good source of leads that could go unnoticed if they aren’t managed well. A plugin like [WooCommerce Product Inquiry and Quotation System](https://wisdmlabs.com/woocommerce-product-enquiry-pro/?ref=13) can make this task a whole lot simpler, help you negotiate, and convert visitors to buyers.
