**A**ccording to India’s  
Ministry of Finance’s report on external debt, India's external debt was at  
around $543 billion as at end-March 2019. In terms of external debt ranking,  
India ranks 24th in the world.

  

  
  

  

  
External debt of  
India is the money owed by India to foreign creditors. In simple words, it is  
the money we have borrowed which we have to pay back (along with the interest  
on it).

  

  
  

  

  
**World’s Most Indebted  
Nations  
  
**With a debt of $20,263  
billion, the United States is the world’s most indebted country, i.e., it has  
the highest external debt. In fact, the U.S.’ external debt is a tad lower than  
the combined external debt of the three next ranked countries: the United  
Kingdom (second rank at $8,491 billion), France ($6,470 billion), and Germany  
($5,800 billion).

**Types of Debts  
  
**As you know,  
based on maturity (when it becomes due for payment), there are two kinds of  
debts: long-term and short-term.

  

  
  

  

  
A loan with a  
maturity period of more than one year is termed **long-term debt**.

  

  
  

  

  
A loan with a  
maturity period of less than one year, i.e., this debt would become due for  
repayment in the next twelve months, is called **short-term debt**.

  

  
  

  

  
Short-term debt  
includes both the principal and the interest on such loans. In other words,  
short term external debt includes short term debt by original maturity as well  
as long term debt (that has become due for maturity).

  

  
  

  

  
A government  
(just about any authority) prefers long-term debt for a fundamental reason: the  
longer the maturity period of the debt the lower the pressure on repayment.

  

  
  

  

  
In this context, it  
is pertinent to cite the breakdown of India’s external debt by maturity: about 80  
per cent of the total external debt is long-term (i.e., about $434 bn of $543  
bn). It is a no-brainer to say that the lower short-term debt works in the  
country’s favour.

  

  

  

  
**Components of  
External Debt  
  
**There  
are several components of India’s external debt. However, for the common person  
to understand something as complex as external debt, the following are the main  
components of India’s external debt:

  

  
  

  

  
•  
**Multilateral credit** – borrowed by the Government of India from  
institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank;

  

  
  

  

  
•  
**Bilateral credit** – borrowed by the Government of India from  
other countries (like Japan);

  

  
  

  

  
•  
**External commercial borrowings (ECBs)** – these are the  
borrowings of companies like Bharti Airtel from abroad;

  

  
  

  

  
•  
**Deposits of Non-Resident Indians (NRIs)**. NRI  
deposits are treated as liabilities as they have to be repaid to the  
depositors, and

  

  
  

  

  
•  
**Foreign Institutional Investment (FII)** – investment by  
foreign fund houses (like mutual funds) in India’s stock markets and government  
securities.

  

  
**  
  
Sources of the external debt of $543 bn  
  
**The Reserve Bank  
of India has a lowdown on the debt mix of the Government of India.

As you deduce  
from the source mix, just about 19 per cent of the total external debt is owed  
by the Government of India. This government debt is also called ‘Sovereign’  
debt. The remaining part of the external debt is non-government debt. 

  

  
  

  

  
**Vulnerability of  
the Indian economy  
  
**India is not  
vulnerable to any major or minor problem arising on the external debt front.  
The World Bank’s SDDS says that there is no vulnerability of the Indian economy  
to external shocks on the debt front. India’s foreign exchange reserves (of around  
$447 billion in November 2019) to external debt is around 82 per cent is within  
manageable limits. 

  

  
  

  

  
That's all folks!
