The representative of the Russian President on digital and technological development Dmitry Peskov said that in two years 5G mobile network could be launched in St. Petersburg. According to him, it will be certified at the World Radiocommunication Conference in the near future.  
  
Mobile operators MTS and MegaFon have already received permission to create a test zone for testing 5G. Tests are planned to be carried out at frequencies in the range of 2.5-2.7 GHz.  
  
Earlier, the Ministry of Defense, the FSB and the Federal Security Service opposed 5G, saying that this resource is used by government services and its transfer to civilian means of communication is inappropriate for security and defense reasons. To date, negotiations are underway to provide organizations with the necessary frequencies that belong to the special services.  
  
In addition, representatives of MTS and MegaFon do not see an urgent need to launch fifth-generation communications, as the technology is expensive. In the near future, 5G technology will not be able to be used by residents of the whole country, but only of certain territories, since its technical maintenance is more complicated than LTE networks.  
  
It is interesting to note that the first operator interested in new generation technology is MegaFon. In 2014, the company signed an agreement with Huawei on the creation of 5G test networks. For example, the operator will begin to test the operation of telemedicine services in medical institutions with the help of a new generation of mobile communications in Moscow from 2019. In addition, 5G speed record belongs to MegaFon. In June, the operator managed to achieve network data transfer at a speed of 35 gigabits per second. The tests were carried out in the laboratory on Huawei equipment.  
  
It should be noted that 5G technologies are designed for higher bandwidth compared to 4G. New network will allow subscribers to connect with each other directly, and the speed of mobile Internet will grow to 1-2 Gbit / s. At the moment, the fifth generation networks are already deployed in several major US cities. Switzerland is actively implementing 5G in Europe. South Korea became the first country in the world to launch commercial services of the newest network in the spring of this year.
