The days are shorter, the nights chillier, and the smell of autumn is in the air. It’s a perfect time to end your day with a warm and relaxing tradition: a mug of mulled wine.

What Is Mulled Wine?
--------------------

Mulled wine is a spiced beverage made with wine, multiple spices, and sometimes fruit rinds or slices. They are typically a blend of aromatic flavorings like cinnamon sticks, allspice, whole cloves, and fruit slices or peel.

Cardamom pods, peppercorns, star anise, and dried ginger are also popular in mulled drinks.Dried orange or lemon zest and raisins are sometimes used as well. It merely depends on the recipe.

To make it, you heat the wine (usually red) in a pot, add your mulling spices and other ingredients, and then strain.

Mulled or spiced wine is served hot, or warm, and traditionally consumed during holidays, like Christmas, but this alcoholic beverage tastes great during chilly autumn nights, too!
