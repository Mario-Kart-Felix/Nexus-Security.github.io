There’s an urgent need for discretion on national television, but shouldn’t it be okay to see the raw, unedited footage of a graphic or gruesome event? The public should have open access to any and all information. This should include uncensored video footage of any news event (if that footage exists).

If you’re tired of seeing blurred-out footage on the evening news, you should know that all the websites on the following list have completely uncensored news footage. These shock websites show you more footage than you’ll ever see on TV. While you won’t find outright gore or nudity on these sites, the videos are still bound to astound you.

1. [Xfinity Video](http://xfinity.comcast.net/video/)
-----------------------------------------------------

You know Xfinity as a popular cable and internet provider, but did you know it also has its fair share of intriguing videos? Xfinity Video is only worth mentioning as a warmup for what’s to come. The videos here are only “shocking” to ultra-conservative types, but it’s where you go if you want to see things like [funny fail videos](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/15-funniest-websites-best-humor-web/), the latest on celebrity drama, the aftermath of natural disasters, violent protests, and even explosions.

You’ll notice that Xfinity Video compiles their footage from a variety of different sources. Although every single video isn’t left unedited, you can still find some raw footage buried among the rest.

2\. [Leaked Reality](https://leakreality.com/)
----------------------------------------------

If you’re looking for sites like LiveLeak (which we’ll get to later), check out Leaked Reality. On Leaked Reality, you’ll find everything from graphic news videos, violent military footage, street fights, transportation accidents, and much more. Each video comes with a tag that displays its rating, as well as the country the video was shot in.

Leaked Reality’s video rating system works much like the MPAA ratings. A video labeled “GA” is much milder than one with the “MA” label. The more “low-key” videos feature things like protests, while the more intense ones have crazy shootouts and other shocking events.

The site has six main video categories at the main menu bar: **Featured**, **News**, **Military**, **Cops**, **WTF**, and **Accidents**. This can help you filter out the type of raw video you want to watch. Plus, you can use the videos’ view counter and user rating to help you determine if a video’s worth clicking on.

3\. [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/index.html)
--------------------------------------------------------------

The DailyMail is a British [world news site](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/top-5-world-news-websites-guaranteed-free-censorship/) that covers political events, celebrity news, sports, and scientific breakthroughs. You might think that Daily Mail censors itself, but the opposite is true. You’ll soon realize that the **Videos** section of its site doesn’t disappoint.

As you browse through videos, you’ll come across some that are shocking and graphic. If you’re watching at work, keep in mind that the site labels any videos with graphic content. That way, you’ll always know what’s appropriate to watch.

Otherwise, you can watch the Daily Mail’s shocking videos to your heart’s content. Bar fights, abductions, massive pimple-popping, and car accidents are just some of the insane videos you’ll see.

4\. [WorldStarHipHop](https://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/)
--------------------------------------------------------------

If you ever see a crazy fight happen in public, you might hear someone yell out “WorldStar!” That’s what WorldStarHipHop is famous for, as the site is a hub for brutal public fights. At the top of the screen, under **Trending Now**, you’ll find the current most popular videos. Scroll down a little further, and you’ll see some music videos.

As you can see, the site has a satisfying collection of fight videos, as well as videos related to hip hop, hilarious pranks, [instant karma](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/satisfying-stories-instant-justice-revenge-sites/), and fails. You’ll find new videos every day—most will make you shock you _and_ make you laugh.

5. [LiveLeak](https://www.liveleak.com/)
----------------------------------------

One of the most well-known sites for accessing news leaks is LiveLeak. Here, you’ll find the gruesome aftermath of accidents, out-of-hand road rage incidents, and other shocking news videos you can’t find anywhere else. If you tend to follow the most violent news stories, like bombings, international conflicts and other news events that involve violence and gore, this is definitely one of the sites you’ll want to bookmark.

In the **News & Politics**, you’ll see the latest in noteworthy events, while the **Law Enforcement **section shows violent clashes with police from around the world. Head to the **Recent Items** tab on the top of the screen to see some of the newer LiveLeak gore videos and other shocking content.

The **Must-See** page is where you’ll find the most shocking videos on the site—it’s where you’ll find some Liveleak shootings videos, uncensored plane crashes, building collapses, dramatic falls, fights, and so much more.

6. [Ebaum’s World](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/videos/)
------------------------------------------------------

If you like a wide variety of shocking video content, then head to Ebaum’s world. The video section includes everything from news events or more random viral and shocking videos. On one page, you can find videos of traffic accidents, public disputes, stupid criminals, and amazing feats.

To look at more specific videos, head to the **More** tab on the top menu bar. Categories like **Facepalm**, **Creepy**, **WTF**, **Ouch**, and more can help you find the type of videos you’re in the mood to watch.

You really never know what to expect when you visit the video area at Ebaum’s World, and that’s what makes it so fun. For unpredictably funny, shocking, or scary videos, you’ll never go wrong visiting this crazy video website.

Access These Shocking Video Websites With Caution
-------------------------------------------------

Are you prepared to view graphic and shocking videos? Before you head to these sites, make sure you’re ready to see things that might leave you feeling bewildered. You should also keep in in mind that each site on this list varies in terms of “shock factor.”

While Xfinity Video has the least graphic videos, Leaked Reality and LiveLeak videos fall on the complete opposite end of the spectrum. As you can probably tell, the rest of the sites fall somewhere in between.

Now that you’ve found the sites that will satisfy your craving for the shocking, don’t you want to look at something a little more lighthearted? Cleanse your palette, and check out these [places to read or hear positive news](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/good-news-read-hear-positive-uplifting-news/).
