3\. [Pathrise’s Job Guides](https://www.pathrise.com/guides/how-to-get-a-job-at-company) (Web): Interview Process at 200+ Top Companies
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you interviewing at a large corporation like Apple or Google? The interview process at top companies is often more grueling than at a smaller firm. And many smaller offices like to imitate the process of bigger ones. Pathrise has compiled the interview process at 200+ top companies so you know what to expect.

The list includes names like Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Netflix, 23andme, Dell, Electronic Arts, Siemens, and Uber.

4\. [HireFunnel’s Question Bank](https://hirefunnel.io/question-bank/) (Web): Most Likely Questions for Any Job Interview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HireFunnel is a video interview service for HR managers. By talking to recruiters and users, the service has now developed a database of questions for recruiters to ask potential candidates. But as a candidate, you can turn the tables and still use this to prepare for your interview.

The question bank has over 300 common questions, divided by the type of role you’re interviewing for. It spans copywriting, sales, management, engineering, and other common job profiles. The questions for each will vary depending on the type of experience you have.

There aren’t any ideal answers to the questions here. Instead, simply add all of these to your workbook to prepare for the interview. Chances are, after this, you won’t be surprised by anything your interviewer throws at you.

5\. [Culture Queries](https://www.keyvalues.com/culture-queries) (Web): What to Ask Your Interviewer
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the end of an interview, the recruiter will likely ask, “So, do you have any questions for us?” It’s good to look engaged at this point and ask a few questions. Culture Queries helps you figure out what to ask and how to ask it so that you can find out more information about the company without appearing nosy or intrusive.

Select multiple tags from six core fields: daily routines, team values, personal health, engineering, career growth, and strategy. Based on what you pick, Culture Queries will give you a few ideal questions, and explain how they tell you what you want to know.

For example, instead of asking “is there work/life balance”, ask “how responsive are people to emails over the weekends and after 6pm?” An interviewer might misinterpret the former to think you are not willing to work hard. The latter assumes your keenness to work while learning about what the company expects of its employees.

You can also review it yourself.

Look, we can spend hours debating about the veracity and legitimacy of the AI’s assessment, but let’s put that on the backburner. For now, you’re getting a free mock interview on video, and you can play it back to see how you did.

Prepare for Soft Skills Questions
---------------------------------

Interviewers ask two types of questions: hard skills and soft skills. Hard skills test whether your technical expertise will meet the job requirements. But most recruiters are checking more for whether your soft skills fit the work environment.

Jobs are about working with people. So the interviewer is checking how you’d do with leadership roles, handle a problem, and so on. It’s important to [prepare for your interview by sharpening soft skills questions](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/interview-soft-skills-questions/).
