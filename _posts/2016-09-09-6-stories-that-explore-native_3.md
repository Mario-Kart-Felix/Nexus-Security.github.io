> Native American Heritage Month has evolved from its beginnings as a week-long celebration in 1986, when President Reagan proclaimed the week of November 23-30, 1986 as “American Indian Week.” Every President since 1995 has issued annual proclamations designating the month of November as the time to celebrate the culture, accomplishments, and contributions of people who were the first inhabitants of the United States. To begin the month-long celebration we found six videos that highlight Native storytellers as well as Indigenous stories. Through dance, family traditions, and music, these stories show the diversity and long history of Indigenous people across the United States.
