Is it really Christmas if you don’t have a Christmas tree? Buying the perfect tree isn’t easy though. Tree lots will try to sell you something you don’t need or can’t use in your house. That’s why you need this guide to pick the perfect Christmas Tree.

Follow the guide’s links in order. It’ll tell you the pros and cons of buying a real tree or a fake tree. It then tells you how to select the perfect tree for you. There is a comprehensive page with tree varieties and their features. And the site also advises you on how to flock your tree and keep it safe from bugs and pests.

Finally, the website lists tree farms, tree lots, and other places to buy it, divided by states in the USA. It also has recommendations for a few other countries. These farms and lots vary, including those where you can cut the tree yourself as well as places with rides and fun activities.
