Isn't amazing how the culture of the (physical Yoga) Hatha Yoga evolved mostly among women? Are we men ashamed to practice this body-mind-spirit wisdom because it became a women’s thing, or discriminative of the idea that we men are tough enough and don’t need this kind of “activity”? We know that the practice of Hatha Yoga was brought to our western culture in the 20th century by masculine Yoga masters, and that mostly men are the creators of the original Yoga Sutra of Patanjali approx. 200 B.C.E - 200 C.E., known also as Raja Yoga or King’s Yoga – the basis of all other Yoga forms practiced around the world.((Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: [The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali](https://www.iep.utm.edu/yoga/#H3))) Keep in mind that Yoga goes much deeper than the physical posture and breathing, yet they are the start and the basis for the inward journey of self-inquiry and self-discovery. The deeper you immerse in the practice, the more you’ll happen to find out about it. An Asana - _aasana_((Wikipedia: [Asana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asana))) or _Yoga posture_ is practiced with a purpose to mobilize the body and mind for achieving mental skills. This tells us that Yoga indeed is great for men. Not long ago, when I invited a friend of mine to a Yoga Asana session I was teaching, he looked at me discouraged with a shy smile on his face, saying “Really, Yoga for men? I don’t know about that. Me, with this belly, tense as I am, it would be an embarrassment to show myself in front of the other more flexible people, let alone perform postures.” I smiled back, and with encouraging voice told him "You always talk about getting in shape! Just come over please and see how simple yoga exercises can change the way you feel about yourself!" With the 7 exercises that follow, in just an hour, we succeeded to remove his misconceptions he had about yoga for men, and changed his [att](https://www.lifehack.org/830597/how-your-attitude-determines-your-success)i[tude](https://www.lifehack.org/830597/how-your-attitude-determines-your-success) positively. Although he was never fond of practicing in groups, he got hooked up - he liked all the beginner postures and started practicing at home regularly and diligently. The most important and ideal Yoga posture are: _“sthirasukhamaasanam”_ – steady and comfortable posture. _Sthira_ meaning steady, stable and strong and _sukham_ meaning comfortable, easy and peaceful, and _aasana_ meaning body posture or pose. This is the entire instruction from the whole Yoga Sutra (YS, 2.46-2.48) on how a Yoga posture ought to be performed. As long as you apply the elements of stability and comfort to your body posture and align it with your breath (YS, 2.47), you perform the _aasana_ correctly. Every man who wants to gain control over his physical and mental well-being and achieve a healthier lifestyle has the reason to get into Yoga. And here is the deal, in the next seven Yoga exercises you’ll see how to get into Yoga safely and successfully. Get ready and get healthier now!

1\. Tadaasana – The Mountain Pose (Variation A - Ideal Alignment)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Tadaasana.png)

1.  Stand up on your feet (see type A), preferably bare feet so you can connect to the ground. **Breathe deeply and slowly**.
2.  Feet **aligned** with the hips.
3.  Kneecaps and thigh muscles **slightly contracted**.
4.  Pelvis **leveled** horizontally.
5.  Chest **open**.
6.  Shoulder blades **relaxed.**
7.  **Connect** the tip of the thumb with the tip of the index finger - **energy re-circulation**.
8.  **Face muscles** relaxed (eyes slightly closed, mouth slightly open).
9.  **Breathe gently** in this position.
10.  On **inhalation**, your head is pulling (cranially) upwards, **lengthening the spine**.
11.  Create a **virtual thread** inside your body from the heels up to the crown - tip of your head.
12.  **Breathe gently**, make sure your whole **body is aligned** as instructed.
13.  **Connect** to the thread and notice its **movement**.
14.  Stay in this position for **12 breaths** – 4 sec. inhale and 6 sec. exhale - approx. 2 minutes according to the [deep breathing exercise no. 1](https://www.lifehack.org/845536/deep-breathing-exercises) in my previous post.

When practicing physical Yoga, we are counting breaths instead measuring time. Aligning the breath with the body posture is an element for the connection with your inner clock – a closer look on what’s going on inside you – inner awareness. The goal of the Mountain Pose is:

*   Stabilizing the nervous system through breathing.
*   Building energy and releasing tension.
*   Stabilizing the movement of the thread (inner stability) through the help of breathing.
*   Developing inner awareness.
*   Awareness of inner movement of body’s stability (the strength) and comfort (the easiness and lightness).
*   Creating a rhythmical breathing.
*   Improving focus, concentration and observation.

2\. Virabhadraasana – The Warrior Pose (Variation)
--------------------------------------------------

![](https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Virabhadraasana.jpg)

5.  Focus your **gaze on one point** and remain in this position for **five slow, deep breaths** (or for as many as it feels right for you).

7.  **Build energy** with each inhalation!
8.  **Release tension** with each exhalation!
9.  Don’t let the muscle contraction intensify too much and disturb your breathing rhythm. **Float the pelvis up and down** to balance the intensity of the muscle contraction.
10.  Do the same with your arms. The moment you feel that the muscle contraction of your shoulders disturb you breathing, **spread and lower the arms**.
11.  **Exhaling**, make a step back, lower your arms and come back to Mountain pose.
