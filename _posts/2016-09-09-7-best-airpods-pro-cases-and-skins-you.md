AirPods Pro not only warrants a whopping [$249](https://geni.us/3A4ubw) price tag but also a mindboggling repair cost – $89 for each earphone (out-of-warranty).

1.ESR Protective Cover

And if you want to protect your all-new wireless earbuds from scratches and even random bumps, be sure to take a close look at this protective cover.

2\. SLEO Shockproof Case
------------------------

  

Featuring a shockproof design, Sleo AirPods Pro case is for the folks who want to go for an additional safeguard to keep the earphones shielded against impact. The combination of **PU leather and soft TPU material** has armored the case to resist shock. Despite having a rugged appearance, it doesn’t look bulky at all.

It indeed feels nice to flaunt something that rules vox pop, doesn’t it? So, if you want to shield your AirPods Pro without covering the design, look no further than this clear case. Made of **high-quality rippled TPU material**, it has a snug-fit profile with **non-slip texture**. Being fully dust-resistant, the cover has got the quality to keep the transparency intact.

4\. ASKCUT
----------

  

Sporting a sophisticated profile, ASKCUT seems quite promising. What makes it a nice choice is the **soft-textured silicone material** that wraps around the AirPods like a form-fitting glove. While the soft finish offers improved grip, the **detachable stainless steel carabiner** makes sure your earphones stay secure. Though the cover is more about style and less about protection, you can expect it to thwart scratches. Besides, ASKCUT silicone cover also gets along perfectly with the wireless charging case. Not to mention, the low price ($4.39) that makes it one of the most affordable AirPods Pro cases in the market.

5.YGoal
-------

  

Still hunting for the AirPods case that can offer the best bang for your bucks? If yes, this offering from YGoal might just be the answer to your search. Well, it looks spot on from a design perspective. The soft silicone material has given it an elegant appearance. And with a **textured finish**, the exterior feels pretty comfortable to the touch. Just like all the counterparts mentioned in this coveted lineup, it also works well with the wireless charging case. Given all these notable qualities, **the $3.95 price tag makes it easily the best value for money** AirPods Pro cases in the market.

6\. SLEO Silicone Case
----------------------

  

Unlike SLEO’s shockproof case, this one has a bit **delicate look courtesy the textured silicone skin**. The smooth leather texture enhances the appearance of the AirPods, while also offering a much-improved grip. But is this silicone skin good enough to resist scratches? Though the manufacturer claims that the case can withstand bumps and also ward off scratches, you can fully trust it to keep scuffs away. And if it’s able to also endure minor shock, consider it an added bonus. Lastly, Sleo silicone skin also comes with an anti-lost rope and carabiner so that you are able to carry the AirPods safely.

7: Best AirPods Pro Skins and Wraps from dbrand
-----------------------------------------------

  

Looking at the wide range of dbrand skins and wraps for AirPods Pro, all I can say is that they are worth giving serious consideration, especially if you aren’t a big fan of cases. The company’s offerings from the wireless earbuds seem to be in line with those for [iPhone 11](https://beebom.com/best-iphone-11-skins/), [11 Pro](https://beebom.com/best-iphone-11-pro-skins/), and [11 Pro Max](https://beebom.com/best-iphone-11-pro-max-skins/). If the textured profile of the dragon skin doesn’t catch your eyeballs, the silky touch of the titanium may be good enough to win you over. Not to underestimate the range of true color variants would be great picks for giving a vibrant look and feel to your earphones.

The use of 3M vinyl has strengthened the structure while also ensuring **the skin works perfectly with wireless charging**. Better still, unlike cheap skins and wraps, dbrand Signature Skins for AirPods Pro don’t leave any residue behind when removed. At $12.95, the wraps are a little pricey. But the quality that they boast makes them a great choice.
