Ten minutes until kick-off. The crew’s at the door. Wait, did you forget the snacks? Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered.

Snacks for game-day don’t have to be a photo-worthy affair. Sure, those mini sliders with your team’s flag hanging off the toothpick are cute, but they also take forever to make. And, when you’re short on time, you just want to feed the hungry crowd.

We get it. That’s why we’ve compiled a list of seven snacks you can throw together in under ten minutes. Yep, you read that right, under ten minutes to snack time for you and the whole gridiron gang.

Guacamole
---------

This one’s a classic choice for a good reason: It’s easy. Really, though, this one’s dependent on whether or not you can source several ripe avocados. If you can, then it’s a no brainer. Simply scoop out the avocado’s insides and mash them up with a little salt, lime juice, and cilantro. Additional ingredients are up to you; you could add onion, tomato, cumin, and even sour cream. Throw it on the table with a bag of chips. Done.

Pico de Gallo
-------------

Pico de gallo—aka salsa fresca—is one of our favorite game-day snacks. It’s easy to make, and once you’ve had it freshly prepared, there’s no going back to the jar. Simply seed and dice a few tomatoes. Throw them in a fine-mesh strainer basket and season with a few pinches of salt. Put the basket in the sink and let the tomato juices drain while you dice up a white onion, a jalapeño, and a fistful of cilantro. Then, mix everything together and serve with tortilla chips.

Charcuterie Platter
-------------------

All right, if the last two were too tough for you, well, three’s a charm. Every game-day glutton we’ve ever met loves a good charcuterie board, even if they can’t pronounce charcuterie. In case we’ve lost you, too, charcuterie (shar-koo-tuh-ree) is a fancy way of referring to a meat and cheese platter.

This can be a wildly creative endeavor, or it can be super simple. Our favorite way to make it happen quickly is to use simple cold cuts, such as salami or prosciutto (although really any lunch meat will do). Lay the sliced meats alongside crackers and sliced cheese. Use bunches of grapes or olives to fill in any empty space. Fancier options might include a spreadable cheese—perhaps goat cheese. Or, for a less gamey bite, maybe cream cheese topped with a jar of salsa and served with salty pretzels is a better move.

Ranch Dip
---------

We’re not talking about the packet of seasoning you might have in the back of a spice cabinet somewhere. We’re talking homemade, impress-your-friends, ranch dip. Promise, it still takes less than 10 minutes, and you won’t dirty more than two spoons and a bowl. All you need is Greek yogurt (or sour cream) and the following dried spices:

*   Parsley
*   Dill weed
*   Garlic powder
*   Onion powder
*   Salt
*   Black pepper

Got it? Sweet. Then mix a  ½ teaspoon (maybe a little less on the garlic and black pepper) of each with one cup of full-fat Greek yogurt and two tablespoons of either lemon juice or apple cider vinegar. Use olive oil (or a few drops of water) to get the right consistency. Don’t forget, as any good cook will remind you, to taste as you go and adjust the ingredients accordingly. Serve this one with potato chips and fresh-cut veggies, like carrots and celery.
