There are all kinds of productivity hacks out there. From the famous [Pomodoro Technique](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/the-pomodoro-technique-is-it-right-for-you.html) to having a well structured, high-energy [morning routine](https://www.lifehack.org/768258/morning-routine-to-make-your-day). The list can go on and on for various productivity methods. But none compare to the productivity hack of making a to-do list. While some would disagree with me, the fact remains we are people in the end. There is something powerful when we put what we need to do on a piece of paper. In fact, putting together a to-do list can make us more productive in the right circumstances. What are the benefits of creating a to-do list? If you couldn't tell, I'm a huge fan of a to-do list. They are what govern my day and I stand by them. Through my use of to-do lists, I've come to learn the perks to them and how to make the most of them. I say this because as I mentioned above, some people would disagree with me. Some turn to articles that claim specific CEOs don't use to-do lists or they've got first-hand experience how to-do lists have failed them in the past. I won't deny that I've struggled at first with a to-do list in the past. But there have also been times where a to-do list has saved me a lot of headaches and strifes as well. As we explore the benefits of these lists, I hope you'll see these lists the same way I do.

1\. To-Do Lists Create Order
----------------------------

First on our list of benefits is the fact it creates order in our lives. Whenever we are tackling a project or following through with a plan, we need it broken down. We do this because our own brain can only handle so much in terms of a task. So if we break down a task into bite-sized and doable chunks, it's easier to process and get things done. You can even stretch this to the point that this helps us strategize our day too.

2\. To-Do Lists Help You Create Accountability
----------------------------------------------

In today's age of technology, it's rare for us to write things down. While that might be troubling to some people, I'd say it's a good thing. It's powerful because when we do write things down, we create accountability for ourselves. Not only that, but something we write down sticks into our mind more than writing it in our smartphone or tablet. Now that you've written something down, you've given it life and it's up to us to accomplish that goal.

3\. You Can Personalize Your To-Do Lists
----------------------------------------

If you look around, you'll find all kinds of styles of to-do lists. Each one is unique and has it's own perks to it - like [this 1-3-5 to-do list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qxcc-LbN8wB8IuQ4bFMgbwSq3ErYvzppJQa09yRL2W0/edit?usp=sharing) created by The Muse. The point is that, there are so many styles that you can take one style and make your own out of it, and still reap the benefits. This means there is plenty of room for you to experiment too.

4\. To-Do Lists Help Relieve Your Stress
----------------------------------------

One other benefit I want to highlight is that it's a stress reliever. I want to bring attention to this for two reasons:

*   The feeling of moving forward and scratching off items on your to-do list is a feel good.
*   But it's that feel-good feeling where some people argue where to-do lists can be destructive.

You see, the act of scratching things off your to-do list releases a substance called dopamine into your brain.((How Stuff Works: [How Dopamine Works](https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/human-brain/dopamine.htm) )) It makes us feel good and happy. But it's also addictive. Where some people argue against to-do lists is the fact some people will purposely make to-do lists excessively long just to get that dopamine fix. This makes sense because like an addiction, we grow numb and eventually need larger dosages to get that same feel-good feeling. While that's not a lie, the truth is that's not on the fault of a to-do list by that point. A to-do list, when done constructively, can relieve stress. When you consider the various methods of making a to-do list, you'll find they're conservative.((HubSpot: [How to Make the Most of Your To-Do List: 7 Styles to Try](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/organize-to-do-list) )) People are only focused on a handful of tasks every day. They don't bother writing a list for every single action they take. You can also [incorporate other principles](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/why-to-do-lists-dont-work-and-done-lists-do.html) into your to-do lists in order to stay focused and relieve stress

5\. A To-Do List Leaves You Open to Rescheduling and Organizing Time
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Part of that stress relief comes in the form of more flexibility and organization of your time. Where there are so many deadlines for us to follow, knowing what's coming up in advance can help us plan better. In the event where you have too many things to do, you can try to reorganize the tasks. This can also work in the reverse where if you see an opening in your schedule, you can pick up your productivity so you can relax more later. Having a to-do list can also help you in getting back to things whenever you are pulled away. Life throws distractions our way all the time, and having a to-do list can help you in getting back after you finished with something that took your attention.

6\. To-Do Lists Help You Delegate
---------------------------------

And on the note of feeling overwhelmed, putting a to-do list can also help you in figuring out what you can delegate. If your list is way too long, you can shorten it by giving it to someone else. The scenarios are different in every situation but for anything work related, there is large and thriving freelance industry ready to handle any task. In other cases, you could find an employee or possibly a family member or friend to help you out with a task outside of work.

7\. A To-Do List Helps You Grow
-------------------------------

When jumping into something, there are bound to be some bumps along the way. While these pitfalls cause people to get turned off from to-do lists entirely, I find them as a reason to grow. With every new problem comes an opportunity to learn, and grow. There are all kinds of pitfalls people fall into with to-do lists((The Muse: [5 Reasons Your To-Do List Is Making You Less Productive](https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-reasons-your-todo-list-is-making-you-less-productive))) and [facing these problems](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/are-you-making-this-major-daily-to-do-list-mistake.html) gives us a chance to thrive, learn and improve. Remember that failure is only truly a failure if you give up and refuse to learn anything from the experience.

How to Reap the Benefits of a To-Do List?
-----------------------------------------

Feeling overwhelmed. Missing deadlines. A tendency to forget about important things. General stress or anxiety and a lack of direction in life.... These are some of the common symptoms some people can experience when they lack a to-do list. At their core, a to-do list is a list of priorities. They can also be a list of goals that you want to achieve in your life or over the course of a week. To-do lists are incredibly flexible tools for people but, it essentially serves as a compass for people. When we are writing something down, it sticks to us and further consult of that list serves as a reminder for us to get it done too. Of course, there are times where a to-do list will fail you. When we don't use them properly, they are what many others have said: a waste of time. After all, most who use to-do lists poorly are unfocused and can be unreliable. But when we are using them properly, this sense of order creates structure and can keep us in check. There is a sense of stress relief because we put into perspective how many things we have to do and the time allotted. This compass aspect also plays another significant role in that it allows us to boost our productivity in several ways. While we think of to-do lists as a simple list of things to do, I've already outlined there are many ways to organize lists. With this in mind, it makes sense there are various ways we can build on that. When we understand how we get things done, we can start to prioritize ways to get things done. Similar to the [80 20 rule](https://www.lifehack.org/840576/what-is-the-80-20-rule), we begin to leverage the methods that will push us the most. For some, it may be narrowing the items into specific instructions. Or maybe we work better with a few items but make them the most important tasks to complete. Whatever the case, when we have a direction, we get a better idea of what are some upgrades((Greatist: [How to Actually Get Sh!t Done With a To-Do List](https://greatist.com/happiness/make-a-to-do-list-get-shit-done#1))) to an already productive system. Furthermore, if we are struggling with getting things on our to-do list, we can turn to active solutions or find some other things that are sapping at our energy. Ultimately, if we are failing at making a to-do list, we can learn to make them better and helpful.

The Bottom Line
---------------

A to-do list is the ultimate form of boosting productivity. Unlike many other tools out there, this one can incorporate multiple methods. Not only that, but it also takes a deeper look at our views and how we work. The fact that a to-do list is so flexible allows us to use various methods and building blocks to make it a tool to help us improve and get so much done. I hope by the end of this you will give this a try and see how much a to-do list can change your life.
