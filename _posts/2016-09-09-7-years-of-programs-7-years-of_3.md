[7 Years of Programs. 7 Years of Gratitude · Digital Harbor Foundation](https://www.digitalharbor.org/donate/). The non-profit Digital Harbor Foundation fosters innovation, tech advancement, and entrepreneurship through educational initiatives in Baltimore and beyond –

> It’s been 7 years since Digital Harbor Foundation opened and in that time, over 5,000 youth in grades 1-12 participated in transformative technology and career-readiness out-of-school-time programs.
> 
> This year, we’re reflecting on everything DHF’s youth have accomplished–from crafting their first piece of code, to forming new friendships, to presenting at the White House, and the thousands of victories in between– and we can’t wait to see how much more they’ll achieve.
> 
> Will you help DHF reach another 7 years?
> 
> We are doing a special push for monthly donors of $7 or more to celebrate 7 years of work. (check out some of the things we have been up to recently here on our flickr page: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/digitalharbor](https://www.flickr.com/photos/digitalharbor))

Today is [#GivingTuesday](https://blog.adafruit.com/?s=%23GivingTuesday) . In the makers/electronics/engineering community we all have something we can give, our time, our talents, our code, our designs, and today we’re celebrating companies and organizations that help make this happen. We’re also celebrating organizations and people that could use your help to keep their efforts going.

We’ll be posting all day with some [#GivingTuesday](https://blog.adafruit.com/?s=%23GivingTuesday) ideas to consider, post yours and we’ll help get the word out.

> GivingTuesday is a global generosity movement unleashing the power of people and organizations to transform their communities and the world on December 3, 2019 and every day.
> 
> It was created in 2012 as a simple idea: a day that encourages people to do good. Over the past seven years, this idea has grown into a global movement that inspires hundreds of millions of people to give, collaborate, and celebrate generosity.
