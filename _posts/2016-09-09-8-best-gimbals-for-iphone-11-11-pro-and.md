-------------------

  

Zhiyun is one of the leading manufacturers of smartphone and DSLR gimbals and their Smooth 4 is a testimony to that fact. **It offers 3-axis handheld gimbal which is capable of stabilizing even the shakiest of movements**.

Other than that, Zhiyun has a dedicated mobile app which is plenty good for shooting various styles of videos.

2\. DJI OSMO Mobile 3
---------------------

  

DJI is a big name in aerial photography thanks to its good lineup of drones. However, not many users know that the company also offers super steady gimbals for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max. Similar to Zhiyun, the DJI OSMO Mobile 3 comes with a 3-axis gimbal stabilizer which is known for its extremely stable electronic motors. **It’s also very lightweight and comfortable to use in comparison to Zhiyun.** The best part about DJI OSMO Mobile 3 is that it supports hand gestures which makes it easy to snap photos and videos. Not to mention, it comes with object tracking and hyper-lapse feature as well. While the debate between Zhiyun and DJI have always been there, I would say if you want an easy-to-use gimbal, go with DJI OSMO Mobile 3.
