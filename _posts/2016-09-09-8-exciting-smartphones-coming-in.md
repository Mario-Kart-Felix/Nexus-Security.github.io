In the past month, we saw some [exciting smartphone launches](https://beebom.com/exciting-smartphones-launching-september/) from major smartphone brands like [Apple](https://beebom.com/iphone-11-pre-orders-live-india/), [OnePlus](https://beebom.com/oneplus-7t-launched-price-specs-features/), [Realme](https://beebom.com/realme-x2-with-snapdragon-730g-30w-vooc-charging-launched/), [Asus](https://beebom.com/rog-phone-2-launched-price-specs-features/) and more. Well, we’ve reached the second phase of the smartphone launch season now. We witnessed the ambitious [Samsung Galaxy Fold](https://beebom.com/galaxy-fold-launched-india-price/) Indian launch yesterday and there are some incredible smartphones coming right up this month. So, let’s get started with the list.  

1\. Google Pixel 4 Series

Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you might have guessed the Google Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL launch. Yes, that’s how frequently Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL have leaked in the past few months revealing almost every aspect of the smartphone. The Pixel 4 series is supposed to come with new **face recognition and motion sensing features, a triple camera setup on the back, a 90Hz display and more RAM**. The only detail left to know regarding the Pixel 4 series is the price and we will get to know that in the [Made by Google event](https://beebom.com/pixel-4-launch-date-confirmed/) scheduled to take place on October 15.

Xiaomi unveiled the [Redmi Note 8 and the Redmi Note 8 Pro](https://beebom.com/redmi-note-8-pro-launched-china/) in China in the last week of August. The handset packs some interesting features like **quad cameras and an IP52 rating**. Considering the serious competition from Realme smartphones in the sub 15K price margin, it will be interesting to know how Redmi decides to price the Redmi Note 8 and the Redmi Note 8 Pro in India. Global VP and MD of Xiaomi India, Manu Kumar Jain, had confirmed that the Redmi Note 8 series would launch [within 8 weeks](https://beebom.com/redmi-note-8-pro-india-launch-8-weeks/) from the Chinese and hence, it is safe to expect the device by the end of the month.

OnePlus recently launched the [OnePlus 7T](https://beebom.com/oneplus-7t-launched-price-specs-features/) in India for Rs.37,999. Unfortunately, the OnePlus 7T Pro was not showcased at the Indian launch event, but the device is expected to make its global debut on October 10 in London. While we don’t know much about the 7T Pro, **I am hoping it arrives in a more compact form factor**. Anyway, we will know all about it pretty soon.

The handset has 5G capabilities and comes with a truly bezel-less design on the sides, circular triple cameras, and the Snapdragon 855+ chipset. The company has not disclosed the Indian launch date but we expect that to happen sometime in October, probably in the last week.
