Decades after the original Star Wars hit theaters, the force is still strong with the enormously successful sci-fi franchise. Since its inception, it’s become a true cultural phenomenon. Don’t let anyone tell you the Disney touch has ruined Star Wars.

One great way fans can enjoy Star Wars is through a huge offering of different apps for iPhone and Android. Everything from games to comic books and much more are available on the App Store and Play Store. Here are the best Star Wars apps to celebrate the franchise any day of the year.

1\. Star Wars
-------------

When starting your app trip through a galaxy far, far away, make sure to begin with the official Star Wars app. The comprehensive app has almost everything you can think of when it comes to the franchise.

After starting the app, you can select from one of three different interfaces: light side, dark side, or droid. Each option offers its own unique designs, sounds, and animations. It’s also a [futuristic augmented reality app](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/futuristic-augmented-reality-apps/), featuring 3D characters, ships, and special quizzes in AR. Google Cardboard users can also battle in Jakku Spy, a serialized feature that ties into Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

Selfie fans can snap a photo in fun costumes and settings like Han Solo’s carbon freeze, learning with Yoda, and more. And that’s far from all. You can also wield a lightsaber and improve your skills with a training remote, relive classic quotes and sound effects on the Star Wars soundboard, and much more.

2\. Disney+
-----------

If you can’t get enough of everything Star Wars, Disney+ is the place to go. The streaming video service offers all the movies, TV series, and more from the Star Wars universe. It’s also the exclusive home for the live-action Star Wars show The Mandalorian.

There’s a dedicated section in the app featuring everything Star Wars. Along with being able to view a video on your iOS or Android device, you can also access Disney+ on many other streaming video devices like Amazon’s Fire TV, Roku, and the Apple TV.

You’ll definitely get your money’s worth, as Disney+ offers much more than Star Wars. This includes content from Marvel, Pixar, National Geographic, and you guessed it—Disney. Even better, the service is significantly less costly than competitors like Netflix.

4\. Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes
-------------------------------

In a crowded universe of Star Wars games, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes stands out. In this full-featured RPG, you can create a team from the light side or dark side and go to war against others. There are more than 140 different characters to collect from different eras of the franchise.

Just make sure to pick wisely, as teams with complementary abilities are best-suited to victory. Some of the fun moves you can deploy against enemies include Luke Skywalker’s Destined Strike, Darth Vader’s Force Crush, and Young Han Solo’s Trick Shot.

And the characters aren’t the only fun. You can grab iconic ships like the Millennium Falcon and Admiral Ackbar’s Home One to battle in space combat.

[](//static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/trivia-start-wars-edition-questions-2.jpg)

How well do you really know Luke Skywalker’s universe? This Star Wars quiz app will tell you. The game covers the first seven episodes of the saga, so it doesn’t have material for the latest releases.

The questions are themed and grouped by each film, and offer a range of challenge. To start, you’ll see questions from A New Hope, and will have to show off your trivia skills to keep progressing. There’s even a bonus level of trivia to find after passing the others.

This app is only available on iOS, but the free Star Quiz is a decent Android equivalent.

**Download:** Trivia – Star Wars Edition: Galaxy Quiz for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trivia-star-wars-edition-galaxy-quiz-adventure/id1116342178?mt=8) (Free, in-app purchases available)  
**Download:** Star Quiz 2019 for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BladeKol.StarQuiz) (Free)

6\. Star Wars Studio FX App
---------------------------

Star Wars toys have always been a great way to create your own massive battle scene for kids (or kids at heart).

And with Hasbro’s Star Wars Studio FX app, you can bring that idea a bit closer to reality. To start, create a scene with any Star Wars action figure, vehicles, or playsets. Then launch the app. Select a special effect and then hit **record** to capture the clip.

For example, with one FX, you’ll see a stormtrooper invade the screen and start blasting. All clips can be saved to your device. While the app is compatible with any toys, you can add other in-game items by scanning codes from specially marked Hasbro Star Wars toys. They also unlock over time by earning rewards through play.

**Download:** Star Wars Studio FX for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/star-wars-studio-fx-app/id1151646674?mt=8) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hasbro.SWFXENTERPRISE) (Free)

7\. Star Wars: Card Trader
--------------------------

Even the timeless hobby of collectible card trading has gone digital. Developed by Topps, a well-known name in the physical card trading world, Star Wars: Card Trader features thousands of different cards.

Along with all the movies, the app also features cards from TV series Star Wars: Rebels, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, and more. You can collect popular characters, droids, vehicles, and locations as the cards feature a number of different unique art styles. New cards land every day.

When you’re ready to trade, it’s easy to reach out to other fans and propose trades with up to 18 cards.

**Download:** Star Wars: Card Trader for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id946777364?mt=8) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.topps.force) (Free, in-app purchases available)
