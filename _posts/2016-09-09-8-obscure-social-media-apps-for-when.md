8\. HOLLA
---------

HOLLA is an app that randomly matches you with strangers through two ways; voice and video chat. What sets it apart from other roulette apps is that when voice chatting, you and the other caller will both need to accept each other’s calls to proceed.

Likewise, when video calling, the chat will be blurred until a face is detected to prevent unwanted content from appearing on-screen. This creates a barrier of safety.

Also, while video calling, you can set up lots of fun filters. And once you’ve finished, you can send friend requests to keep the conversation going later on.

In essence, HOLLA is a fun way of chatting to strangers, and the best option if you want to chat with new faces and voices.

**Download:** HOLLA for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/holla-live-random-video-chat/id1125318983) (Free, in-app purchases)

Why Not Try a Social Media Detox?
---------------------------------

While these obscure social media apps offer alternatives to the norm, sometimes, the best alternative to social media is, well… no social media at all.

Social media is often very stressful, and we frequently find ourselves pulling our hair out at some of the content we see, read, and publish. That’s why it can be really healthy and relieving to take a break from your phone once in a while. So why not go out, get some fresh air, and explore nature?

For more on this, be sure to read our tutorial explaining [how to enjoy a social media detox](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/social-media-detox/).
