> The first startup we came across using fungi was New Yawk based Ecovative which was featured in a piece we wrote on Recyclable Building Materials You Can Grow Yourself.

In September of this year, they announced the formation of an entirely new company dedicated to the future of animal-free meat: Atlast Food Company.
