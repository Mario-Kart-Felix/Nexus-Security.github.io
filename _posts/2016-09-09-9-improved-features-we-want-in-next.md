Apple released the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro in September 2019 to the usual fanfare. These devices are solid upgrades from the previous models, and introduce many desirable features like a new triple-camera setup, stunning battery life, and better displays.

However, these changes feel incremental and leave us hungry for more. There are lots of headline features missing from 2019’s iPhone models that we’d love to see introduced soon. Below are the top new features we want to see in Apple’s next iPhone lineup.

1\. A Smaller Notch
-------------------

In 2017 Apple introduced the iPhone X, an almost all-screen phone with minimal bezels and no home button. This meant no more Touch ID. And to make up for its absence, the iPhone needed a new form of biometric security. That’s how Face ID was born.

The components needed for Face ID sit at the top of the phone, resulting in a black bar that interrupts the all-screen design. That bar [has been dubbed the “notch,”](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/smartphone-notches-explained/) and resulted in the annoyance of many users.

Wouldn’t it be awesome if Apple found a way to reduce this notch? Perhaps the company could use a hole-punch design similar to Samsung’s? An under-display camera would be neat, as well.

2\. 5G Support
--------------

[5G is the next step in mobile network technology](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/lte-vs-4g-vs-5g-whats-difference/) after 4G LTE, offering lightning-fast speeds. Some Android flagships, like the Samsung Galaxy S10, offer a 5G-compatible model. None of Apple’s offerings have 5G capabilities yet.

This makes sense, because 5G isn’t fully ready yet. Still, it would be awesome to see next year’s iPhone models come with dashing next-gen speeds.

3\. A New (or Old) Design
-------------------------

Every iPhone model since the iPhone 6 has had a very similar design, with rounded edges and paper-thin builds. Wouldn’t it be nice to see a change for once? A return to the classic, thicker, squared-off design of the iPhone 5, but with a full screen, would be neat.

Even better, that design would allow for bigger batteries and cameras flush with the back of the device. This wish isn’t too far-fetched, since Apple’s latest iPad Pro design somewhat follows this philosophy.

4\. ProMotion Displays
----------------------

Another iPad Pro feature that Apple should bring over to its iPhone lineup is ProMotion. This isn’t “promotion” as in cheaper prices—although that’d be appreciated.

ProMotion is Apple’s name for a display technology that allows for variable refresh rates up to 120Hz. If you’re not familiar, the refresh rate is how many frames appear on the screen per second. The higher a display’s refresh rate, the smoother the visuals appear.

The standard on most mobile phones is 60Hz, or 60 frames per second. ProMotion allows compatible devices to output at 120Hz when necessary, but drops down to conserve energy when there’s not much on the screen.

A smoother iPhone display would make everything you do on the device look better.

5\. A USB-C Port
----------------

This one’s a no-brainer. Most of Apple’s newer devices use a USB-C port, so why not the iPhone?

USB-C has better compatibility with other devices, carries more power, and can deliver super-fast data speeds. When traveling, you also won’t need more than one charger for your devices. The future is clearly USB-C, and the iPhone needs to adapt to this by getting rid of the aging Lightning port.

6\. Reverse Wireless Charging
-----------------------------

Samsung’s flagship smartphones can serve as charging mats for other devices through built-in reverse wireless charging. So when your pal’s AirPods are low on juice, you can lend a bit of power with the back of your Samsung phone, albeit a little slowly. Sounds neat, right?

This form of wireless charging was rumored as an inclusion in the iPhone 11, but was reportedly scrapped at the last minute because it was too inefficient for Apple’s standards. For the next devices, we’d love to see a perfected, power-efficient version of reverse wireless charging.

7\. Bigger and Smaller Sizes
----------------------------

Each iPhone since the iPhone X has followed the same size standards, so we think it’s time for more variety.

A smaller phone would be great for iPhone SE fans who want something compact and easy to maneuver with a single hand. On the other end of the spectrum, a bigger screen would be incredible for users who want something on par with the cinematic display of the 6.8-inch Galaxy Note 10 Plus.

Of course, there’d still be an in-between with the medium-sized standard model. Choice is really a win-win for everyone.

8\. Better Baseline Storage
---------------------------

The iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro start at 64GB of storage. For a smartphone in 2019, this is simply inexcusable considering the competition. This paltry storage size is simply not enough anymore.

With all those 4K ultra-enhanced photos and videos to store, 64GB will only last you a short time. 128GB of space should be the norm, and we really hope that Apple realizes this in time for the next releases.

9\. The Return of Touch ID
--------------------------

Face ID is great, don’t get us wrong. But it just hasn’t reached the breakneck speeds of Touch ID in its heyday.

Touch ID is much better for hands-on people who want to have a sense of satisfaction when unlocking their phone. It’s also more secure now than when it was removed, thanks to ultrasonic sensors that detect blood flow (like the Galaxy S10 has).

Knowing this, we feel Touch ID should come back through in-display tech. That being said, Face ID should stick around too; the new iPhone can have both. Having Touch ID and Face ID on the same device would, again, provide users with more choice. With both implemented, your iPhone would become like a secure, virtual passport.

High Expectations for the Next iPhone Models
--------------------------------------------

It’s safe to say that expectations for next year’s iPhones are sky-high. After the somewhat tame year of the iPhone 11, many are eager to see what Apple has planned next. There’s a lot of potential for the next iteration of the iPhone to change the game.

See [our comparison of the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/iphone-11-vs-iphone-11-pro/) if you’re not sure which one is right for you.
