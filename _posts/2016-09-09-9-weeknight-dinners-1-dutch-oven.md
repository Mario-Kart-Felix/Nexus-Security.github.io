We all want a home-cooked meal after a long day, but none of us want to scrub two pots and a pan post-dinner. Let’s ditch the dishwashing and talk about Dutch oven dinners, instead.

One-pot meals are everyone’s favorite because, honestly, no one enjoys washing dishes. And, if you’re reading this and thinking to yourself, “Hmm, I like a good dishwashing session,” we’re not sure we can help you. You are, however, welcome to our dish piles anytime.

For everyone else, let’s look at a few recipes that require one Dutch oven, and very little clean-up!

Winner, Winner, Chicken Dinner
------------------------------

Chicken and Dutch ovens belong together. Recipes abound for whole roasted chicken and deep-fried delights. Sadly, neither of those options result in a complete one-pot meal as you still need side dishes. Of course, there are a few genius recipes out there that give you chicken, a starch, and a whole lot of veggies in one container.

Here are a few we’re fans of:

*   **Mushroom and Chicken Risotto: **Risotto is a classic choice for a Dutch oven. Luckily, with just a few additions, you can make it a complete meal. We’re partial to this mushroom and chicken risotto from Food and Wine.

*   **Chicken & Biscuit Casserole:** Biscuits and gravy in a casserole—that’s the essence of this genius one-pot dinner. And, if you’re anything like us, you can’t wait to try it.

*   **Chicken Pot Pie: **With help from a little puff pastry, you can turn your Dutch oven into a giant pot pie. It’s the perfect meal for a family, without the drudgery of forming individual pie crusts.
