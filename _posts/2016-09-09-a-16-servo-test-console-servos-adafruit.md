Will Cogley [posts](http://www.nilheim.co.uk/latest-projects/16-channel-3d-printed-servo-tester) on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/cvqAoBrLs7M) a DIY 16 channel servo tester with 3D printed case.

> Pretty much every project I’ve done just lately has required me to test out some servos and experiment with their positions before they go into the assembly. I usually make a quick servo tester on a breadboard and use the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE to get the servo positions, but this time I decided I’d treat myself and design an enclosed, permanent system to test my servos!

The [Adafruit 16-channel servo driver board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/815) makes it a breeze to build such a project. The servos show up on a screen in groups of four, and can be tested four at a time with the pots. The buttons let the user move up and down between the groups.

See the Hackaday article [here](https://hackaday.com/2020/01/05/space-saving-servo-tester-console-looks-space-worthy/), the code [here](http://www.nilheim.co.uk/uploads/1/2/6/9/126907979/servo_tester_download_package.zip) and the [video](https://youtu.be/cvqAoBrLs7M) below for details.
