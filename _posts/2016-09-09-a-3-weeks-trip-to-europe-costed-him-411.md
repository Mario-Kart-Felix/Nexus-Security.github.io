**Would you believe me if I told you that my recent [3.5 week trip to France and Italy](http://frugalfrolicker.com/trip-planning-europe-2017/) only cost me $411?**

Well it’s true! Obviously if we’re looking at raw spend, my expenses totaled way more than that amount. But once you factor in various savings, such as taking a break from the high cost of living in Sydney, having most of my rent covered by subletters while I was away, and booking flights with miles, that number shrinks dramatically – to the point where my bank account hardly even takes a hit.

Allow me to illustrate!

_Note: the numbers below are from 27 days of travel (25 days in Europe + 2 days in air transit) and are in US dollars._

What I Spent: $2529
-------------------

I’m not going to get overly detailed with what I spent on my Euro Trip, but here are the main expenses I incurred:

*   $859 on accommodation _(mostly [Airbnbs](http://www.airbnb.com.au/c/lb337?s=8), some shared with friends)_
*   $83 on coffee _(slightly less than I spend at home)_
*   $598 on transport
*   $591 on food_ (about 50% more than I spend at home)_
*   $118 on alcohol _(some months I literally spend $0 on drinking; d__amn you, [aperol spritz](http://www.thisbatteredsuitcase.com/an-ode-to-the-aperol-spritz)!)_

I booked all of my accommodation and train tickets a few months in advance because I knew I’d be traveling during peak season in Europe and didn’t want to run the risk of everything being booked out. Mostly though, I wanted to be done with all the logistical stuff ahead of time so that I wouldn’t have to stress over it or spend any of my precious vacation time on it while I was actually in Europe. I admit, it’s not my normal whimsical travel style, but I’m so glad I planned ahead for this trip!

One nice side effect was that I often paid less for booking so far ahead: I found some surprisingly cheap yet very well-reviewed rooms on [Airbnb](http://www.airbnb.com.au/c/lb337?s=8) in the $30-40 range, and I snagged some really cheap train tickets on some of the routes.

_I probably spent way too much on gelato._

#### What I _Didn’t_ Spend Money On: my long haul flight to/from Australia

You might have noticed that the amount I spent on transport looks a little low, given how much moving around I did and how far I traveled. That’s because this number does NOT include a roundtrip flight from Australia, which would easily tack on another $2000 or so.

Being the frugal frolicker I am, I didn’t pay for my roundtrip flight because I cashed in some air miles I’d been hoarding for a few years. I booked my flights from Sydney to New York and from Milan to Sydney using miles and only paid a couple hundred dollars in taxes and fees for them.

But because I was already going to be flying back to the US for my cousin’s wedding, I’d be paying to travel across the world regardless of whether I went to Europe – therefore, I’m not counting this flight toward my Europe expenses.

I did, however, have to book my one-way flight from New York to Paris which cost me $310 – so we’ll count that.

> #### HOW TO SAVE MONEY
> 
> If you’re traveling during peak season, try to book your accommodation and transport well in advance so that you can take advantage of cheaper rates. **Sign up for Airbnb using [this link](http://www.airbnb.com.au/c/lb337?s=8) and save $40 off your first booking!**
> 
> Book your overseas flight using credit card points or air miles. My favorite travel hacking strategy is to sign up for a new credit card when they’re offering a big sign-up bonus (usually 50,000 free miles), spend whatever it is the minimum spend is to earn this bonus (usually $4000 spent in the first 3 months), and cancel the card before the annual fee is due. I’ll then have a massive pool of credit card points from which to transfer to an airline partner and use to book long haul flights that would normally cost me $1000+. **Check out [The Points Guy](https://thepointsguy.com/cards/) to find out which credit cards to sign up for to maximize your travel hacking.**

> Add on a stopover as part of another trip you’re taking already. Going home for a wedding? Flying somewhere for a business trip? Take advantage of the travel expenses that you’re already incurring and tack on some extra time to spend near your destination.

What I Saved: $2118
-------------------

While I did spend $2529 in Europe, that’s not really how much I’m out of pocket for spending these 27 days overseas.

**What I really care about is how much extra money I spent that I normally wouldn’t have**, had I been living my “normal” day-to-day life back in Sydney.

Thus, I’ll adjust this raw spend for two things:

*   $1092 that I earned for renting out my room on [Airbnb](http://www.airbnb.com.au/c/lb337?s=8) while I was away
*   $1026 that I \*would have\* spent on day-to-day expenses in Sydney had I been home during this time. This is based on an average daily spend of $38_ (includes food, transport, health, fitness, household goods, shopping, and other miscellaneous expenses; excludes expenses that I have regardless of whether I stay home or travel – e.g. rent, household bills, [student loans](http://frugalfrolicker.com/travel-with-student-loans/), web hosting)._

That’s a total of $2118 that I saved by not living in Sydney during these 27 days.

> #### HOW TO MAKE MONEY
> 
> Rent out your room while you’re traveling overseas. You can post an ad on [Craigslist](http://craigslist.org) (US) or [Gumtree](http://gumtree.com.au) (AUS) or a local Facebook housing group, or become a host on [Airbnb](http://www.airbnb.com.au/c/lb337?s=8) so that others can book your room.

> #### HOW TO SAVE MONEY
> 
> Leave behind your normal daily expenses if you have a relatively high cost of living and travel to somewhere with a lower cost of living. Pause your gym membership, curb the shopping, cut down on nights out.

Total Net Spend: $411
---------------------

So how much extra money did I end up spending because I buggered off to Europe for a few weeks instead of staying in Sydney? Not much at all, it turns out:

**Total Spent:** $2529

**Total Saved:** $2118

**Total Net Spend: **$2529 – $2118 = $411

Conclusion: Travel Doesn’t Have To Cost You Much
------------------------------------------------

This isn’t the first time I’ve dropped this truth bomb, and I can assure you it won’t be the last. But guys, how often do we write off travel opportunities because we figure we can’t afford them?

Honestly, I was in no financial position to go gallivanting overseas this year. I’ve already spent a large chunk of change on furnishing and moving into a new apartment, tuition for my course, and visa fees. The money situation has been stressful to say the least.

But there’s this little thing I like to do called THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX. Not accepting what’s given, getting creative with solutions, and doing things that most other people probably aren’t doing. I highly recommend it, particularly when debating between a $4000 trip vs. staying at home. Don’t forget about secret option C here! You can make the trip happen for much less money when you get creative and [put some effort toward saving money](http://frugalfrolicker.com/15-ways-to-save-money-for-travel/).
