**A** month back I wrote an **[article on the Citizenship Amendment Act](http://www.bjnocabbages.com/2019/12/the-caa-demographics-identity.html)**. Today's article is on the NRC and the Assam Accord  
  
**What is the National Register of Citizens (NRC)**  
  
**T**he  
National Register of Citizens (NRC) has become another political football. The  
BJP’s decades-old stand on the NRC has remained the same. From the party’s  
manifesto in the 1996 general election to the 2019 general election, the BJP  
has remained firm on completing an NRC to curb illegal migration into India,  
especially in the north-eastern states from Bangladesh.  

  

  
In the 1996 manifesto, the party articulated **three  
Ds: detection, deletion, and deportation** – detection of illegal immigrants,  
deletion of their names from the electoral rolls, and deportation to the  
country of their origin.  
  
  
  
In the 2019 manifesto, the party declared that: _“There has been a huge change in the cultural and linguistic identity  
of some areas due to illegal immigration, resulting in an adverse impact on  
local people’s livelihood and employment. We will complete the National  
Register of Citizens process in these areas on priority. In future we will  
implement the NRC in a phased manner in other parts of the country. We will  
continue to undertake effective steps to prevent illegal immigration in the  
north-eastern states. For this we will further strengthen our border security.”

**What is the Assam Accord?**

  

  
**T**he reader must note that the NRC idea is not the  
BJP’s baby. The NRC idea, first proposed in 1951, took root in the 1970s when  
the All Assam Students Union (AASU) launched a mass movement after its scrutiny  
of the local electoral rolls revealed names of a large number of illegal  
Bangladeshis. The AASU protested vehemently with its ‘Ds’ demand: detection,  
deletion, and deportation – detection of illegal immigrants, deletion of their  
names from the electoral rolls, and deportation to Bangladesh. The protest  
gained popular traction as it touched a raw nerve of the locals: they had been impacted  
adversely, especially demographically and economically, by the presence of illegal  
Bangladeshis.  
  
  
  
However, it was only in August 1985 when the Rajiv Gandhi-led Congress  
Government and the AASU signed the Assam Accord. The central feature of the  
Assam Accord were the 3 Ds: detection, deletion, and deportation – detection of  
illegal immigrants, deletion of their names from the electoral rolls, and  
deportation to Bangladesh.

  

  
  

  

  
Under the Assam Accord, the Citizenship Act was  
amended to include clause 6A that provided for the classification of immigrants  
in Assam: 

  

  

  

  
*   those who came before 1966 (including Hindu refugees who fled East  
    Pakistan during the 1965 war); 
  
*   those who came between 1966 and 24 March 1971 (when war with Pakistan  
    officially commenced); and 
  
*   those who came after 25 March 1971 (war refugees and later illegal  
    immigrants). 
  

  
  
Citizenship was to be given to all those who migrated before 1966 from  
east Bengal and east Pakistan. Those who came between 1966 and 1971 were to be  
disenfranchised and granted citizenship after due process. Those who came after  
24 March 1971 were to be detected and deported.  
  

  
  

  

  
Subsequent governments at both the Centre and in  
Assam failed to complete the NRC. Fed up with the indifferent attitude of the  
state government, the AASU knocked on the doors of the Supreme Court, which ruled  
that the NRC, promised under the Assam Accord, must be completed under its  
supervision.

  

  
  
  
Now, it is clear that the NRC in Assam was (i) a  
provision of the Assam Accord, to which the Congress was a party; (ii) held in  
the state after the Supreme Court of India called for its implementation and  
(iii) the central government has had no role in its completion.  
  
  

  

  
The draft NRC in Assam registered 2,89,83,677 out of the  
state’s 3.3 crore population (census-based). The rest were left out; in other  
words, they could be classified as ‘illegal immigrants’. It is here that the  
Bangladesh Government comes in; in case, Bangladesh refuses to acknowledge these  
four million as its own citizens, they run the risk of being labelled ‘stateless’.  
  

  

  
For now, t[](https://www.blogger.com/null)he BJP’s flip-flop has  
only muddled the NRC debate. Things get murky when the ruling party does not lend  
clarity on its current stance, especially considering the several misgivings  
about documentation and proof of citizenship.  
  
  
  
**Identifying illegal foreigners – whose job is it?  
  
****T**he  
Central Government is vested with powers to deport a foreign national under  
section 3(2)(c) of the Foreigners Act, 1946. These powers to identify and  
deport illegally staying foreign nationals have also been  
delegated to the State Governments/ Union Territory Administrations and the  
Bureau of Immigration under the Foreigners Act, 1946. Detection and  
deportation of such illegal immigrants is a continuous process. Statistical data of cases regarding illegal immigrants is not centrally  
maintained.  
  
I think the BJP should run a better PR machine with focus on three central aspects of the CAA: (a) that the CAA is an amendment to the existing Citizenship Act, 1955,  
(b) that it only speeds up the process of granting citizenship to members of  
certain communities, and (c) that it does not relate to the citizens of India.
