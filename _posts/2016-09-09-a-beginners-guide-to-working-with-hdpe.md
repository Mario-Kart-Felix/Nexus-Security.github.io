There are numerous tutorials online on how to melt and reuse High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) plastic. The [Brothers Make](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0A0TIq-WDyKZcGcOt5WpPA) offer their take on it in this video. They go over what HDPE is, how to melt and use it, and what tools you’ll need.

They also offer an example project using the material, an HDPE pen. Turning and making your own pens seems to be all the rage these days.
