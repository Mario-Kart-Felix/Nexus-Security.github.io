Yesterday, 20 years ago, the first version of the MQTT was published:

> On this day, 20 years ago, the first version of [#MQTT](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MQTT?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) was published by me [@IBM](https://twitter.com/IBM?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and [@arlennipper](https://twitter.com/arlennipper?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) now [@CirrusLink](https://twitter.com/CirrusLink?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)!

As of last April, [OASIS published the fifth version of this protocol named MQTT v5.0](https://mqtt.org/2019/04/mqtt-v5-0-now-an-official-oasis-standard). MQTT v5 adds new load balancing techniques and enhanced error reporting among other things.

Here at Adafruit, we’re big fans of this stateful, low-bandwidth, pubsub protocol.

We wrote [an Arduino library to add MQTT support to platforms such as the ESP8266, Arduino Yun, Adafruit FONA and more](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MQTT_Library):

[Our **free** internet-of-things-service, Adafruit.io](http://adafruit.io), communicates with thousands of devices using a powerful MQTT API.

As of this past summer, CircuitPython received its own MQTT library called MiniMQTT! [We have a guide about it here](https://learn.adafruit.com/mqtt-in-circuitpython). CircuitPython cloud-service provider libraries such as Adafruit IO, [Google Cloud IoT Core](https://learn.adafruit.com/pyportal-iot-plant-monitor-with-google-cloud-iot-core-and-circuitpython), and [Amazon AWS IoT](https://learn.adafruit.com/pyportal-iot-plant-monitor-with-aws-iot-and-circuitpython) utilize this library “under-the-hood”.

Thanks @andysc, @ibm and @arlennipper for publishing the internet-of-thing’s favorite protocol!
