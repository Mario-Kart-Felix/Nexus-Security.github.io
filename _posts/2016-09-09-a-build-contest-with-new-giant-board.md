We love the new [Giant Board](https://www.crowdsupply.com/groboards/giant-board) – a complete Linux single board computer (SBC) in a tiny [Feather form factor](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-feather/blob/master/README.md).

Microchip (maker of the SAMA5D2 ARM Cortex-A5 CPU chip) and others are sponsoring [a contest on electromaker.io](https://www.electromaker.io/contest/giant-board) to see what creative projects can be made from this wonderous board by [Groboards](https://groboards.com/).

Apply For Your Free Giant Board
-------------------------------

Entering is simple. Just come up with a unique project idea that incorporates the Giant Board and submit your idea using 150 words. Once you receive your board you can start building your project while using the [Electromaker](https://www.electromaker.io/contest/giant-board) platform to document your build along the way. $2000 in cash prizes will be awarded to the top three projects!

Adafruit FeatherWing and Blinka Support
---------------------------------------

Helpfully, the Giant Board rocks support for the popular and capable FeatherWing ecosystem. [Hailing from Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/category/943), [Feather is a line of development boards](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-feather/blob/master/README.md) ready for prototyping. Because the Giant Board supports accessories within the FeatherWing family, it’s incredibly easy to get started creating. Coupled with Linux support, the Giant Board is ready for use out-of-the-box with minimal set up. Onboard, there’s an Adafruit FeatherWing pinout for connectivity with over 60 add-on boards. You can spin up projects easily with CircuitPython. LCD, Ethernet, and Wi-Fi FeatherWing boards may be tacked onto the Giant Board for added functionality.

Moreover, the Giant Board touts Adafruit Blinka support, or [CircuitPython for Linux](https://circuitpython.org/blinka). Essentially, the Blinka repository is a collection of [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) packages. With FeatherWing and Blinka support, Giant Board is prepped for your development and programming needs. Tinker away!
