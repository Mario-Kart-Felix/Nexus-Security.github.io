[Robotron.info blogs](https://www.rototron.info/circuitpython-ble-client-server-tutorial/) about using Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Bluetooth boards to automate the power on a surveillance camera server.

> This CircuitPython tutorial demonstrates how to build a battery powered Bluetooth BLE remote control to operate a BLE peripheral hosting a solenoid and a spectrally selective light detector.  Two [Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4062) boards will be used for the BLE client and server.
> 
> Currently the only way to turn it on is by pressing the illuminated push button on the front of the case.  My goal is to build a BLE peripheral that can attach to the front panel so I can turn it on remotely from outside the closet.  I also want the peripheral to wirelessly report whether the server is on or off.

The Feathers are programmed in [CircuitPython](https://www.circuitPython.org/) 5.0 alpha which has active BLE development.
