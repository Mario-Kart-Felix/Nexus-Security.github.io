Don’t remember Prodigy? From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodigy_(online_service)):

> **Prodigy Communications Corporation** was an [online service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_service "Online service") from 1984 to 2001 that offered its subscribers access to a broad range of networked services, including news, weather, shopping, bulletin boards, games, polls, expert columns, banking, stocks, travel, and a variety of other features.
> 
> Prodigy was described by the New York Times as “family-oriented” and one of “the Big Three information services” in 1994.
> 
> On November 6, 2001, SBC purchased 100% interest in Prodigy and brought it private. On November 14, 2001, SBC and [Yahoo!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo! "Yahoo!") [announced](https://web.archive.org/web/20060407085319/http://docs.yahoo.com/docs/pr/release863.html) the strategic alliance to create the co-branded [SBC Yahoo!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T_Yahoo! "AT&T Yahoo!"). Sometime thereafter, SBC ceased offering new Prodigy accounts, and customers were encouraged to migrate to the SBC Yahoo! product line to the sbc.yahoo.com internet portal, while being able to keep their {username}@Prodigy.net email addresses.
