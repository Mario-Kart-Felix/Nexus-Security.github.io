> A mathematician has derived an easier way to solve quadratic equation problems, according to MIT’s Technology Review. Quadratic equations are polynomials that include an x², and teachers use them to teach students to find two solutions at once. The new process, developed by Dr. Po-Shen Loh at Carnegie Mellon University, goes around traditional methods like completing the square and turns finding roots into a simpler thing involving fewer steps that are also more intuitive. Here’s Dr. Loh’s explainer video.
