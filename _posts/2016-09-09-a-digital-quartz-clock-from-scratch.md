Erik van Zijst shared the details of his custom made 24H digital clock build on [Medium!](https://medium.com/@erikvanzijst/a-digital-quartz-clock-from-scratch-a80ec5e427)

> After 20+ years of programming, I wanted to get some understanding of the electronics that make my career possible.  
> I had built the basic individual logic gates with transistors on a breadboard, but to build anything meaningful I needed loads of them and so I bought a somewhat random collection of logic chips on Amazon which introduced me to the 7400-series and the concept of datasheets.
