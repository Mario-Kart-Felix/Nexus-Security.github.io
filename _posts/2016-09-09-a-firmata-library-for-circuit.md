[Alan Yorinks](https://twitter.com/BrassFigLigee/status/1214907426866114562) posts on Twitter about remote monitoring and control of an [Adafruit C](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333)ircuit Playground Express from a Windows, macOS, Linux or Raspberry Pi PC.

There is a simple and intuitive Python 3 compatible [API library](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata-cpx/blob/master/docs/api.html) for programming, fully documented and [available on GitHub.io,](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata-cpx/blob/master/docs/api.html) along with a [complete users guide](https://mryslab.github.io/pymata-cpx/).

People have been asking for a Firmata type library for the Circuit Playground Express. Alan has provided one and itâ€™s available under a GNU AFFERO GPL V3. [See more details here](https://mryslab.github.io/pymata-cpx/).
