[Ed Nisley posts](https://softsolder.com/2019/12/24/google-pixel-3a-microscope-adapter/) about building yet another camera adapter, this time for a microscope eyepiece.

> Hand-holding my [Google Pixel 3a phone](https://fi.google.com/about/phones/#pixel-3a) over the microscope eyepiece worked well enough to justify building [Yet](https://softsolder.com/2017/08/04/stereo-zoom-microscope-ring-light-mounting-tape/) [Another](https://softsolder.com/2015/08/31/stereo-zoom-microscope-usb-camera-mount/) [Camera](https://softsolder.com/2011/11/14/canon-sx230hs-microscope-and-close-up-macro-adapters/) [Adapter](https://softsolder.com/2008/12/26/camera-microscope-adapter/):

> The snout is a loose fit around the [5× widefield microscope eyepiece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyepiece), with the difference made up in a wrap of black tape; it’s much easier to adjust the fit upward than to bore out the snout. An overwrap of tape secures the snout to the eyepiece, which I’ve dedicated to the cause; the scope normally rocks 10× widefield glass.

> The tapered hole exposes the phone’s fingerprint reader to simplify unlocking, should it shut down while I’m fiddling with something else.

> The microscope doesn’t fully illuminate the [camera’s entrance pupil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrance_pupil) at minimum zoom, with 4.5× filling the screen and (mostly) eliminating the vignette. The corner blocks have oversize holes to allow aligning the camera lens axis over the microscope optical axis. The solid model incorporates Lessons Learned from the version you see here, because you (well, I) can’t measure the camera axis with respect to the outside dimensions accurately enough.
