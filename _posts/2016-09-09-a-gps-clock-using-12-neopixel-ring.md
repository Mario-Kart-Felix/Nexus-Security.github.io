J. Blake Harris [posts on Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/169508-gps-clock) an [Adafruit Flora](https://www.adafruit.com/product/659)\-based, GPS enabled clock which displays the time using 12 RBG colored NeoPixels arranged in a circle.

> An Arduino-based GPS clock using a microcontroller with a GPS attachment and a 12-neopixel ring. I based this project on Adafruit’s awesome Neopixel watch.
> 
> This project uses an Arduino-friendly microcontroller (the smaller, the better – I used an [Adafruit Flora microcontroller](https://www.adafruit.com/product/659)), with an [added GPS chip](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1059) to determine the time, and a [12-NeoPixel ring](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1643).

> A pink/salmon color is used to display the time, hour is an orange-yellow, and the seconds blink at the top. If the signal is unavailable, the ring will be entirely blue.
