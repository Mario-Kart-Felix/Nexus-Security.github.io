[This is a follow up to our first post](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/10/02/grossdomesticproduct-banksy-installation-banksy/) about the upcoming Banksy store… [Banksy opens homeware store after card company legal dispute – ITV News](https://www.itv.com/news/2019-10-01/banksy-opens-homeware-store-after-card-company-legal-dispute/).

> Graffiti artist [Banksy](http://www.banksy.co.uk/) says he has been forced to open his own homeware store following a legal dispute involving a greeting cards company.
> 
> He said: “A greetings cards company is contesting the trademark I hold to my art, and attempting to take custody of my name so they can sell their fake Banksy merchandise legally.  
> “I think they’re banking on the idea I won’t show up in court to defend myself.”
> 
> …
> 
> He said: “Banksy is in a difficult position because he doesn’t produce his own range of shoddy merchandise and the law is quite clear – if the trademark holder is not using the mark, then it can be transferred to someone who will.”
> 
> As a solution to the issue, Mr Stephens proposed that Bansky began his own range of merchandise and opened a shop.
> 
> Mr Stephens said the card company, who he refused to name, initiated the legal proceedings about 12 months ago.

Searching the European Union Intellectual Property Office at [https://www.tmdn.org](https://www.tmdn.org) for BANKSY yields the following ([PDF](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2019/10/tmv-result-list.pdf)). I could not immediately see a greeting card company that has a registration, but I’ll look more closely later. Banksy does seem to be doing a good job registering the name in most/all territories and has this comment from the article too:

He added: _“I still encourage anyone to copy, borrow, steal and amend my art for amusement, academic research or activism. I just don’t want them to get sole custody of my name.”_

Sounds like an open-source hardware company.
