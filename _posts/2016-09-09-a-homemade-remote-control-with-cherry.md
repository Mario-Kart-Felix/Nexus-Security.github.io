On the Facelesstech blog, comes the design for an infrared remote using Cherry keyswitches:

> I’ve got a TV in my garage that I use to test things out on, I lost the remote for it, when I did find it, it had seen better days. This got me thinking that I should just make my own with just the basic functionally that I need.

**Hardware**

*   Arduino pro mini
*   MX cherry blue keys x5
*   GX-12 5pin connector
*   TP4056 USB C charger
*   DD0505MD DCDC boost
*   IR LED 940nm
*   IR receiver
*   Lipo
*   3 way switch

> With most projects I try to introduce A new part or a new way of doing something, This time it’s the MX cherry blue keys I’m using as buttons. I could have just used boring clicky button which would have made it much smaller but I wanted to try using these as button to see how well they work. I have also got a 3d printer while doing this project which makes it easy to make custom keycaps for it.

As for the case, a 3D print is used as an enclosure for a project.
