[Kerry D. Wong](http://www.kerrywong.com/) posts a teardown of the [Keithley 230 Programmable Four-Quadrant Voltage Source](http://www.kerrywong.com/2019/10/25/teardown-of-a-keithley-230-programmable-four-quadrant-voltage-source/ "Permanent Link to Teardown of a Keithley 230 Programmable Four-Quadrant Voltage Source")

> The latest addition to my lab equipment is a [Keithley 230](https://www.equipnet.com/mp_data/media/5manual_2013911_17279_1.pdf) programmable voltage source which can output up to ±100V. Unlike many of the power supplies and voltage sources I have, the Keithley 230 is capable of operating in all four quadrants, meaning it can both source and sink current in either of the output polarities. Although the current capability is limited to ±100mA.

Voltage sources like this one are commonly used in automated testing environments. The 230 has trigger input/output BNC connectors and digital I/O connections. Along with the GPIB connection, operator can program the 230 to perform sequences of tasks automatically.
