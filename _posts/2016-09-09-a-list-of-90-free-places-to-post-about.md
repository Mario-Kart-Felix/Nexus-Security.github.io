Ready to share your app with the world?
---------------------------------------

We wanted to share a few resources that we came across during [our own Product Hunt launch.](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/sizle-3)

Check out the list before for a curated collection of places to list and submit your startup for free. At the time of writing this 99% of these are free and very easy to submit, if you come across one that is paid or know of another listing that can be added to this list, let us know and we’ll edit the post 😊

🚀 = Post on launch day  
⏰ = Post a few days before launch
