> The European Space Agency has successfully launched its Cheops satellite as part of a mission to explore exoplanets that exist beyond our Solar System. Assuming everything goes according to plan, Cheops will be used to learn more about these distant planets, some of which are believed to be potentially capable of sustaining life. This is the first time the ESA has launched a mission dedicated to these planets.

> Exoplanet is the term used to refer to an extrasolar planet, which means one located outside of our Solar System. There are billions of these planets, the evidence of which was discovered in the early 1900s. Humanity received its first confirmation of an exoplanet’s existence in 1992, something that has snowballed into the regular discovery of exoplanets due largely to more modern technologies.
