> My 1946 Radio Holland “Koningin Emma” RCA AR-88 radio did not have protective panels for the sides, top and back anymore so Tije made me one. Especially at night and viewed from the top this provides a warm and wonderful light play.

Much about the receiver is remarkable. It looks as if it’s been assembled by improvisation but if you listen to the sound it produces from the signals that it absorbs from a basic antenna, you can only be very impressed. This one is designed and built by people with a full understanding of the technique, well beyond the mere theory of the concept. Remember, this thing is 73 years old!

And it’s been all over the place. It probably helps that so many thousands were built by large teams who’d developed a perfectionist production routine to help win WWII. And this one was built when much of the production capacity was still going strong.

See the [video](https://player.vimeo.com/video/358363418) above and [the accompanying blog post](http://kostverlorenvaart.blogspot.com/2019/09/tijes-cabinet-for-radio-holland-rca.html) along with [the post on the electronics restoration](https://kostverlorenvaart.blogspot.com/2019/02/radio-holland-1946-rca-ar-88-koningin.html). Lovely!
