Kristina Panos posts a [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) game project on Hackaday.io – [no step on snek](https://hackaday.io/project/168815-no-step-on-snek).

It runs on the [Adafruit Edge Badge](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4400), [PyBadge](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4200), or [PyBadge LC](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3939) and uses the badge buttons as game controls.

> The first “real” version of the game is now available. You can grab the required code.py, spritesheet bmp, and map.csv files from the [files section here on the io page](https://hackaday.io/project/168815-no-step-on-snek#menu-files).  There is a quick video demo in the description _(below)_.
> 
> The game currently features 1 map with 3 kinds of enemies: Boots, Flip Flops, and Converse All Stars. Each of them move at a unique speed and/or direction. There are also 3ish obstacles that Blinka can’t move on which make the game a bit more challenging by limiting the players lateral movement. They are a newspaper bin, a transit ticket kiosk, and a vendor stand with an umbrella topper, which technically counts as a 4th type of obstacle.
> 
> There are 2 types of building graphics to make top and bottom, “foreground” and “background” sections and 2 colors of doors, though only the green one is hooked up at the moment.
