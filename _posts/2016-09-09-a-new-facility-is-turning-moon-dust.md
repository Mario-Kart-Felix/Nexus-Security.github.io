> Normally, it would be inadvisable to breathe in Moon dust, given that it is packed with spiky particles that [can injure or kill people](https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/22apr_dontinhale) if inhaled. But though it is dangerous in its raw form, processed lunar soil could become a major source of breathable air for future astronauts tasked with exploring the Moon’s surface.

> Nearly half of the Moon’s soil is made of oxygen, an essential resource for human life support as well as a useful ingredient for many fuels. To figure out how to extract extraterrestrial oxygen on future Moon missions, scientists have established the first prototype of a small oxygen-producing plant, according to [the European Space Agency](http://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Engineering_Technology/ESA_opens_oxygen_plant_making_air_out_of_moondust) (ESA).
