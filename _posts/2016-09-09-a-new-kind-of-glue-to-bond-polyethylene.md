A team of researchers from the University of Victoria and the University of British Columbia, both in Canada, has developed a new kind of glue that is able to bond polyethylene materials together. In their paper published in the journal Science, the group explains how they created a carbene crosslinker with two diazirine motifs. Felix de Zwart, Johan Bootsma and, Bas de Bruin with the University of Amsterdam have published a Perspective piece in the same journal issue outlining the work by the team.
