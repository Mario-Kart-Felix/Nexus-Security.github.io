Hey there, all the gamers and tech freaks. Beware! A new malware is coming right at you. Also known as 'Spidey Bot' by its researchers, this malware is quite dangerous as it can take all your personal information such as passwords, IP addresses, emails, contacts, and Discord usernames. The Windows Malware does this by inserting itself into the Discord app's cipher.

As if this wasn't enough, the malware can also get a backdoor entrance into your device by copying the first 50 letters typed in your keyboard which may contain critical information such as recently used passwords. This is done in order to get more malware fixed in your device. Discord is an application that is specifically designed for the video gaming community. It is also a digital platform where various PC gamers from across the world can connect and form a community of their own.  
  
Lately, Discord has also become an ideal platform for users who have been thrown out from Twitter and Reddit for their peculiarly offensive comments; hence they are free to express their thoughts here. Sadly, you won't be able to grasp if your Discord file is affected, and even if you do, you can't do anything much about it. The best you can do is remove the software and then reinstall it to confirm that you are safe. Therefore, having the best antivirus is the only solution to prevent your computer from malware threats. Even the software company Discord is helpless in countering to user problems.  
  
"Unluckily, there's nothing any Discord can do to anticipate threats here. Still, the user should be careful while clicking on unknown links and should be critical of downloading unfamiliar software. Doing so can invite Malware to your system. Installing an untrusted program can alter your Discord on your PC," tweeted Discord in response to user complaints. This is not the problem with the language but it's on the user end. The only alternative solution to this Malware threat is by telling the user to access the Discord app via their phones and gaming consoles instead of your computers.
