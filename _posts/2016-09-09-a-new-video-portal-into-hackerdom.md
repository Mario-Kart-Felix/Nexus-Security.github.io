Via [Thibault Schrepel](https://twitter.com/LeConcurrential/status/1213509678128349184?s=03) on Twitter, “Have a look at this FANTASTIC website initiated by [Biella Coleman](https://twitter.com/BiellaColeman), a Faculty Associate at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard”

[hackcur.io](https://hackcur.io) is a video portal that helps explain why hacking is one of the most important phenomena of global culture and politics in the late 20th and early 21st. The site features short video clips on a range of hacker topics that are accompanied by a brief explainer about the footage.

> Watching—you can hear and see what hackers think about their craft; learn about where and how they labor; discover their quirks, foibles, and accomplishments. Watch a few videos and it might become a bit harder to slot the hacker into a single category or type. Hackers are dynamic, diverse, and they change over time.
> 
> There is no single way to hack. But look closer: hacker practices, ideas, and ideals also cohere into stable nodes like [free software](https://hackcur.io/category/free-and-open-source/), [anti-security](https://hackcur.io/category/anti-security/), [hacktivism](https://hackcur.io/category/hacktivism/), and [piracy](https://hackcur.io/category/piracy/)—just some of the rich and diverse [categories](https://hackcur.io/category/gaming/) that you can explore through this project.

> _Hacker._
> 
> There is no single definition of hackers, but many forking paths and twisty little passages. Linger a while and you will come to appreciate just how central hackers and hacking are to contemporary life.
