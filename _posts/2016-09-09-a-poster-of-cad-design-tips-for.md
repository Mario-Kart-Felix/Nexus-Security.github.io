“Maker of many kinds, serial skill-collector, and STEM-student,” [Billie Ruben](https://twitter.com/BillieRubenMake/status/1218496270836256769), has created this very useful little poster of do’s, don’ts, and other design considerations for creating CAD files for 3D printing.

You can download a large version of the poster, along with two other 3DP tips posters she’s created [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/SqIdFwB). While on the Imgur link, don’t forget to check out Billie’s other two posters with more tips on what modeling programs to use for different types of 3DP and the ins and outs of 3D printer bed leveling.
