​In the theory of _Ritz_ light emitted by a source moving with velocity _u_ is propagated through space in the direction of the motion of the source with the velocity _c+u_, _c_ being the velocity of light emitted by a motionless source. In other theories (_Lorentz, Einstein_ ) the velocity of light is always _c_, independent of the motion of the source. Now it is easily seen that the hypothesis of Ritz leads to results which are absolutely inadmissible.

Consider one of the components of a double star, and an observer situated at a great distance Δ. Let at the time _t_, the projection of ​the star's velocity in the direction towards the observer be _u_. Then from the law of motion of the star we can derive an equation:

u = f ( t − t 0 )   {\\displaystyle u=f(t-t\_{0})\\ } ![{\displaystyle u=f(t-t_{0})\ }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6cb7799d3e3491ee52ca871a3e9d7252d38571b9)

The light emitted by the star at the time _t_ reaches the observer at the time τ = t + Δ / c − a u {\\displaystyle \\tau =t+\\Delta /c-au} ![{\displaystyle \tau =t+\Delta /c-au}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/edf4ff3c0cd85c94d0f870d7b90b30223093cb00) . In Ritz's theory we have, neglecting the second and higher powers of u / c ,   a = Δ / c 2 {\\displaystyle u/c,\\ a=\\Delta /c^{2}} ![{\displaystyle u/c,\ a=\Delta /c^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/cd9e98f8fb61f92758b985d680945f832c4e460e) . In other theories we have _a=0_. If now we put τ 0 = t 0 + Δ / c {\\displaystyle \\tau \_{0}=t\_{0}+\\Delta /c} ![{\displaystyle \tau _{0}=t_{0}+\Delta /c}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1969d5a4367a0ed9ddb6eb49f8f2a53f9691fa66) , we have

u = f ( τ − τ 0 + a u )   {\\displaystyle u=f(\\tau -\\tau \_{0}+au)\\ } ![{\displaystyle u=f(\tau -\tau _{0}+au)\ }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0c1b3d1d9e0d69b6e8159ceae177d03a0867e549) or u = φ ( τ − τ 0 ) {\\displaystyle u=\\varphi (\\tau -\\tau \_{0})} ![{\displaystyle u=\varphi (\tau -\tau _{0})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/18fd76656be21043f129a75a798feadc43c28fa0)

The function _φ_ will differ from _f_, unless _au_ be immeasurably small. Therefore if one of the two equations (1) and (2) is in agreement with the laws of mechanics, the other is not. Now _a_ is far from small. In the case of spectroscopic doubles _u_ is not small, and consequently _au_ can reach considerable amounts. Taking e.g. u = 100 K M s e c {\\displaystyle u=100{\\frac {KM}{sec}}} ![{\displaystyle u=100{\frac {KM}{sec}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a85cb9edc9ac580a1e8438fe54c9d388b4041e3d) , and assuming a parallax of 0",1, from which  Δ / c = 33 {\\displaystyle \\Delta /c=33} ![{\displaystyle \Delta /c=33}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/da5cf1f1935f42c58012fff085fb0de55fcaf525) years, we find approximately _au=4_ days., i.e. entirely of the order of magnitude of the periodic time of the best known spectroscopic doubles.

Now the observed velocities of spectroscopic doubles, i. e. the equation (2), are as a matter of fact satisfactorily represented by a Keplerian motion. Moreover in many cases the orbit derived from the radial velocities is confirmed by visual observations (as for δ Equulei, ζ Herculis, etc.) or by eclipse-observations (as in Algol-variables). We can thus not avoid the conclusion that _a_\=0, i.e. the velocity of light is independent of the motion of the source. _Ritz's_ theory would force us to assume that the motion of the double stars is governed not by _Newton's_ law, but by a much more complicated law, depending on the star's distance from the earth, which is evidently absurd.
