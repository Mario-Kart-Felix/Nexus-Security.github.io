There’s been a spate of apocalypse related articles over the last few weeks, but when I saw [an AM radio made from a hand-wound coil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUMXc6fi7yk) and an oxidized British penny, I couldn’t help but be impressed. We’ve covered [foxhole radios](https://hackaday.com/2016/04/21/hacking-when-it-counts-pow-canteen-radios/), stereotypical radios that are cobbled together from found parts during wartime.

This example uses a variable capacitor for tuning, but that’s technically optional. All that’s really needed is a coil and something to work as a diode. Surprisingly, copper oxide is a semiconductor, and the surface oxidation on a penny is enough to form a rudimentary diode. Though, note, not all pennies have that necessary coating of copper. If a penny has green oxide, it’s likely a candidate.

Need a quickly cobbled together AM radio? Have some wire and a penny? Yeah, watch the video below the break, and you’ll know how to make it happen. When the apocalypse comes, you’ll thank us.
