\[Adnan.R.Khan\] had a sliding door latch plus an Arduino, and hacked together this [cool but simple app controlled door lock.](https://hackaday.io/project/166180-automatic-door-locking-system-controlled-by-mobile)

Mechanically the lock consists of a Solarbotics GM3 motor, some [Meccano](https://hackaday.com/2017/11/03/meccano-piston-pump-made-with-a-syringe/), and a servo arm. A string is tied between two pulleys and looped around the slide of a barrel latch. When the motor moves back and forth it’s enough to slide the lock in and out. Electronically an Arduino and a Bluetooth module provide the electronics. The system runs from a 9V battery, and we’re interested to know whether there were any tricks pulled to make the battery last.

The system’s software is a simple program built in MIT App Inventor. Still, it’s pretty cool that you can get functionally close to a production product with parts that are very much lying around. It also makes us think of maybe keeping our childhood Meccano sets a little closer to the bench!
