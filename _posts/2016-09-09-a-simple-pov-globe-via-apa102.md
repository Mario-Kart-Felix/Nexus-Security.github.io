POV builds come in all shapes and sizes, and typically rely on LEDs for their high light output and fast response time. With this in mind, \[Great Scott\] grabbed some LED strip off the shelf [and set about whipping up a POV LED globe.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69G522AeRq8)

Being a spinning POV build, it’s necessary to consider how to get power to the rotating elements. \[Great Scott\] decided to go with a simple solution of putting a LiPo battery on the rotating assembly, which runs the LEDs and Arduino Nano at the heart of the operation. The LEDs in question are of the APA102 type, making them readily addressable and capable of a wide color gamut. It’s all spun by a simple brushed DC motor, running from a separate supply at the base of the platform.

It’s very much a hacker build, held together with duct tape and zipties. Despite this, it looks tidy when in operation, as all of the important hardware is hidden at the centre of the globe. There’s a bit of a vibration problem, but \[Great Scott\] reckons this can be fixed with some frame modifications.

We’d love to see the build run some more advanced operations, like a representation of the Earth, or some kind of sun clock. If you’re interested in learning more about POV displays, [we’ve got the primer you need](https://hackaday.com/2019/10/29/the-basics-of-persistence-of-vision-projects/). Video after the break.
