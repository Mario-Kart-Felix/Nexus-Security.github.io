[Hackster.io tweets](https://twitter.com/Hacksterio/status/1220341733214556160) about building a new sock-based bot:

> Time to build a new bot! [@glowascii](https://twitter.com/glowascii) has been wanting to make a sock-puppet robot, to show off all the cool socks people are giving away as swag nowadays. Weâ€™re starting with a base of [@Adafruit](https://twitter.com/adafruit) parts and programming in [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/)!

The [project page](https://www.hackster.io/videos/536) provides the details including the [video below](https://youtu.be/3NHsuM2nhzU). The build uses the [Adafruit Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333) and add-on [Crickit robotics board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3093). The project is programmed easily in [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/).
