[Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2020/01/09/mini-space-station-keeps-tabs-on-the-real-one/) & [Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/169266-3d-printed-iss-desktop-beacon-and-ifttt-notifier) feature user Lance’s project to signal if the International Space Station is overhead.

> The International Space Station (ISS) has been up and running since 2000. Since that time, we have always had humans living in space. (Pretty Awesome!)
> 
> Making around 15 passes per day, this device combines 3D printing, coding, and soldering to notify you via blinking and IFTTT notification if its arrival.
> 
> This project combined a number of different material including 3D printed parts, small circuit boards, solar panels, the Particle IO, a webhook, ISS Open Notify, and IFTTT.

A 3D printed models was modified from one  on Thingiverse \[ISS Model – [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:992074](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:992074)\] to fit the small baby solar panels used later along with arms to hold it and a box to hold the electronics.
