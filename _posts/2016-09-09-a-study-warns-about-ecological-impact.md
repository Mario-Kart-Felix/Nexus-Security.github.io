Insects, crustaceans and other water macroinvertebrates are more affected by the effect of sediment accumulation in river courses than the excess of nitrate in water environments, according to a study published in the journal PLOS ONE. Sediments that get accumulated in rivers—due intensive agriculture and deforestation in gallery forests—alter the ecological traits of fluvial habitats and deteriorate the biological communities at all levels.
