If ever there was a quintessential weapon of science fiction, it would have to be the ray gun. \[lonesoulsurfer\] [built this one-of-a-kind stunner](https://www.instructables.com/id/Ray-Gun-With-Laser-Sound-Effects/) from his impressive collection of junk. It’s centered around a vintage Bakelite soldering gun, a vacuum tube, and a portable stove burner, all of which contribute to the fantastic mid-century look.

Inside is a slightly modified version of a ray gun sound effects circuit from MAKE: that squeezes square waves from a lo-fi synth builder’s favorite IC, the 40106 hex inverting Schmitt trigger. \[lonesoulsurfer\] was able to reuse the soldering gun’s trigger to start the pew-pew-pew, and he can adjust the death ray’s output with potentiometers. The gun is powered by an old cell phone battery and a combo Li-ion charger/step-up module from the world’s largest virtual auction house. Blast past the break to watch the build video.

If one little green LED isn’t enough for you, maybe you’d prefer [this light painting gun](https://hackaday.com/2014/04/19/a-light-painting-infrared-ray-gun/).
