Sometimes the simplest hacks are the most useful ones, and they don’t come much simpler than [the little supercapacitor LED flashlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3_MFAJZld0) from serial maker of cool stuff \[Jeremy S. Cook\]. Little more than an LED, a supercapacitor, USB plug, and couple of resistors, it makes a neat little flashlight that charges from any USB A power socket and delivers usable light for over half an hour.

It’s neat, but on its own there’s not much to detain the reader until it is revealed as a “Hello World” supercapacitor project from [an article in which he delves into the possibilities of these still rather exotic components](https://www.embedded-computing.com/guest-blogs/maker-pro-supercapacitors-demystified-part-2-hands-on-experimentation). Its point is to explore their different properties when compared to a battery, for example a linear voltage drop in contrast to the sharp drop-off of a chemical cell. In the video below the break we see him try a little boost regulator to deliver a constant voltage, with consequent severe loss of lighting time for the LED. It’s by this type of experimentation that we learn our way around a component unfamiliar to us, and the article and video are certainly worth a look if you’ve never used a supercapacitor before.
