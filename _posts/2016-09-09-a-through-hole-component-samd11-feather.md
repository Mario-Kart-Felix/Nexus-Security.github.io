Joey Castillo [posts on Twitter](https://twitter.com/josecastillo/status/1214709951123410944) details of his first [Feather form factor](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-feather/blob/master/README.md) board, utilizing a SAMD11 processor and mostly through-hole components:

> Holy crap, this board! Iâ€™d forgotten all about it, but today it surfaced while I was looking for something else. This is the first Feather I ever designed: a simple SAMD11 board with mostly thru-hole components, because as of last summer (2019), I was still afraid of surface mount parts.
