[Stefan’s Blog posts](https://blog.krastanov.org/2020/02/17/pcb-layout-timelapse/) the design of a PCB using [KiCad](https://kicad-pcb.org/) as a timelapse image.

> I have been working on a [small electronic jewelry-like device](https://spinwearables.com/) meant to teach kids how to program… As it is an educational project, it certainly needs pleasant teaching materials and visuals. One such visual, meant for the “Engineer’s Diary” where we describe the process of creating the device, is a timelapse of the CAD design for the printed circuit board.

The Electronics CAD work was done in KiCad, which is an open source tool with lovely documentation and available tutorials. One of its subtools, pcbnew, lets you turn the abstract circuit diagram into the actual physical layout of the device. As with most such tools, the main tasks are to place the required components judiciously, such that you can route all the electrical connections between them by drawing traces and puncturing vias where necessary.

See [the blog post](https://blog.krastanov.org/2020/02/17/pcb-layout-timelapse/) for the step by step process on how to get the design frame by frame. And the result:
