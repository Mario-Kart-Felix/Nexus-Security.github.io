Angela Sheehan [posts on Twitter](https://twitter.com/the_gella) her new automated companion. Her purple robot is incredible. The electronics are based on the [Adafruit Feather M0 with radio microcontroller board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3176) with [NeoPixel lights](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1312) and a capacitive touch sensor on the forehead. Servo motors flaps the wings and tilt the head.

Angela has programmed her companion to work with her [color stealing fairy wand](https://hackaday.io/project/168199-color-stealing-fairy), developed previously with an [Adafruit Flora color sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1356). The detected color is sent over to the companion via radio.

> My new best friend. Still working on her 'skin' of faux fur and shoulder harness. So happy with this creature! Built with an [@adafruit](https://twitter.com/adafruit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Feather M0, Neopixels, 2 servos, and a generous amount of 3D printing [pic.twitter.com/BBHa059iZP](https://t.co/BBHa059iZP)
