Spread via malvertising attacks, the banking trojan fools its victims through fake McDonald's coupons as a bait. This came into notice when banking details of Latin American buyers were tried to steal. The trojan discovered by experts at ESET is known as **Mispadu**, and it is similar to other trojans like Casbaneiro and Amavaldo that are found in Latin America. The trojan uses a remote crypto key for covering its original language. Mispadu targets users from Mexico and Brazil.

**False McDonald’s tokens are used to lure the customers- **  
The process consists of using bogus McD offer tokens as bait. These discount vouchers are either sent through spam e-mails or facebook ads which when clicked, takes the user to the primary site of the coupon. When the user clicks the button to get the coupon, they are displayed with an MSI option. The hacker uses this MSI installer to start a command that deciphers and performs an initializing course which allows them to connect to a remote server. "The trojan was also detected when working on a harmful Chrome version. It's built to shield the Google Chrome network to instead affect its victims' devices through the support of JavaScript," confirms ESET's inquiry.  
  
**Loots banking and personal information- **  
Once the malware successfully invades a system, Mispadu uses false popup notifications to convince possible targets to share personal data. The primary aim of the trojan is to obtain critical system knowledge like- commonly used Latin American banking apps menu and downloaded safety products. The trojan also steals information from several network browsers and e-mail consumers. This includes Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Outlook, Internet Explorer, and many more.  
  
"Mispadu can also steal crypto funds like Bitcoins using a technique like a clipboard hijacking. But fortunately, no such case has appeared to date," says ESET. The elements of the Google Chrome expansion that the trojan uses for sharing can also collect users' transaction information and debit card data through various sites by scouring the information from data application lists. "For securing a backdoor entry in your device, Mispadu can automatically capture a screenshot, regulate your keyboard and mouse controls, and recover commands," say the experts.
