Sometimes when you’re going through a Natural History Museum, and you’re looking for big giant dinosaur bones (because big giant dinosaur bones are the reason to go to Natural History Museums) you’ll get lost. When I get lost in a Natural History Museum, I always get lost in the botany section. For awhile, the plants just seem like a bunch of plants — but eventually all those plants start to seem like in enormous system of verdant enchantment, miraculous in its efficiency and profound int its interdependence.

This animation from Katie Scott, James Paulley, and Azuma Makoto gets across the same sensation – via [The Kids Should See This](https://thekidshouldseethis.com/post/story-of-flowers-botanical-animation-azuma-makoto)

> Growing, blooming, rooting. Soil aeration, pollination. Enduring wind, rain, and pollution, dispersing seeds, and growing anew. Directed by Tokyo-based botanical artist [Azuma Makoto](https://twitter.com/azumamakoto), [Story of Flowers](http://azumamakoto.com/1669/)showcases the life cycle of flowers as a wordless explainer. The breathtaking floral animation was illustrated by [Katie Scott](https://katie-scott.com/) of the [_Welcome to the Museum_ books](https://amzn.to/2tuJT6w), with animation by [James Paulley](https://jamespaulley.com/).
