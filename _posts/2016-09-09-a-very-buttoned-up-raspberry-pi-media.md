Projects that turn the Raspberry Pi into a low-cost Network Attached Storage (NAS) solution are very common; all you need is the right software, the Pi itself, and some USB storage devices. But unless you particularly like the “Medusa” look, with loose cables running all over the place, you’ll probably want to put the hardware into a suitable enclosure. Unfortunately, that’s where the somewhat unusual layout of the Pi can make things tricky.

Which is why \[AraymBox\] came up with this [unique “capsule” enclosure for the Raspberry Pi and two USB-attached hard drives](https://www.instructables.com/id/PiNAS-the-Raspberry-Pi-NAS/). Every effort has been made to keep the outside of this design as clean and streamlined as possible. The asymmetrical loops of wires that we so often see on other projects are gone, with everything been brought inside thanks to some clever wiring. This enclosure looks like a professional product, and if you’re willing to put in the effort, you can have one to call your own.

So it should be an easy print even on a relatively low-end machine. Of course, you’re not going to get that futuristic metallic look without a little work. You’ll need to do a considerable amount of [sanding, filling, and paint work to get that kind of a surface finish](https://hackaday.com/2017/11/15/visual-3d-print-finishing-guide/). Then again, that rough “just printed” look has a certain cyberpunk appeal to it as well.

But the printed enclosure is only half the battle. Inside, \[AraymBox\] has soldered the USB to SATA adapter cables directly to the Raspberry Pi to keep things tight and compact. A micro USB breakout board was then used to add a power connector on the back of the device where the Ethernet and USB ports are, solving the issue of having one lonely USB cable coming out of the side of the case.

In the past we’ve seen other attempts to [create a 3D printable enclosure for Pi servers](https://hackaday.com/2018/03/21/3d-printed-raspberry-pi-nas-with-dual-drive-bays/), with varying levels of success. While some would argue that the better solution is to just [throw the Pi and the drives in a large enough enclosure](https://hackaday.com/2019/11/01/raspberry-pi-nas-makes-itself-at-home-in-donor-pc/) that it doesn’t matter what the wiring looks like, we appreciate the effort that some hackers are willing to put in to make something custom.
