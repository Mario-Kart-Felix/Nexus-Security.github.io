Have you ever been stuck in a hotel room wishing you brought your VR-capable gaming PC along with you? Well \[thegarbz\] certainly has, which was the inspiration for this absolutely gorgeous [mobile rig affectionately known as “The Nuclear Football”](https://imgur.com/a/R0D0Aac) that brings console-level portability to those who count themselves among the PC Master Race.

We’ll admit that the existence of gaming laptops means you don’t _actually_ need to carry around such an elaborate contraption just to play Steam games on the go. But if you’re going to do it, shouldn’t you do it in style? More practically speaking, \[thegarbz\] says the cost of this project was less than what a gaming laptop of similar specs would have cost.

The Nuclear Football features a Ryzen 5 2600 processor, a NVIDIA 2070 Super graphics card, and 16 GB of DDR4 RAM. The water cooling gear is from Alphacool, and includes a custom controller that links to the computer and allows \[thegarbz\] to monitor temperatures and fan speeds via a widget on the desktop.

While not nearly as mobile, this machine does remind us of the water cooled “Big O” that [packed all the current-gen consoles and a gaming PC into one glorious machine](https://hackaday.com/2019/07/25/pc-and-console-gaming-united-courtesy-of-origin/).
