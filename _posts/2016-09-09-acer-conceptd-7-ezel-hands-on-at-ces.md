[Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel hands-on at CES 2020](https://varindia.com/video/acer-conceptd-7-ezel-handson-at-ces-2020#.XhcLGjaY7OM.blogger): Acer's ConceptD 7 Ezel and ConceptD 7 Ezel Pro are NVIDIA RTX-powered machines in surprisingly sleek bodies, but they also feature new hinges that enable their displays to swing almost 360 degrees. This way, you can use them in five different modes -- sharing, floating, pad, display and stand.
