I’ve always been intrigued by ideas for reusing/upcycling old or dead computers. Sadly, the videos and articles online tend to focus on the same reuse of parts, or obvious things, like creating a media center, or a raid array.

This video, on _DIY Perks_, contains some of the most clever reuses I’ve seen, everything from turning the mic into a headset mic, to turning the speakers into wall-mounted speakers, to turning a damaged hard drive into a wall-projecting laser VU meter. Wall lights, illuminated picture frames, a fan-cooled LED work light, a light table, USB battery chargers — so many cool ideas.
