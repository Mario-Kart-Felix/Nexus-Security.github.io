Wow, there is Ada Lovelace Gin. Eleanor and Francis Ford Coppola have a company called [Great Women Spirits](https://www.thefamilycoppola.com/en/adventure/greatwomenspirits/story) via [Beyond the Beyond](https://www.wired.com/beyond-the-beyond/2019/10/ada-lovelace-gin/).

> Why GREAT WOMEN SPIRITS?
> 
> The Family Coppola are lovers not only of wine, but spirits as well. In fact, when the family gathers, the custom is to have a cocktail, or two, before dinner. They hope to bring even more joy to cocktail enthusiasts everywhere by crafting a collection of spirits as unique and remarkable as the women they honor. All of our spirits are crafted in a style that reflects the individual character of these trailblazers, and are proofed with pristine water from our Napa Valley Estate.
