[Jerry tweeted](https://twitter.com/jerryhjones/status/1183934076400439296) about macOS Catalina’s new feature that allows running iOS apps using Catalyst, the example was our Bluefruit app, so we of course had to try it! It was easy! We’re going to test and do any fixes and have a version out soon, thanks Collin! ([video](https://youtu.be/uwRm5PNhPX4)).
