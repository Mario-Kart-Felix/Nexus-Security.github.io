[Adafruit fuels the creativity of tomorrow today – Panasonic North America – United States](https://na.panasonic.com/us/case-study/adafruit-fuels-creativity-tomorrow-today).

> Fried first noticed the Grid-EYE on the catalogue website for Digi-Key, an electronic components distributor. At the time, Adafruit was stocking various infrared sensors, but those only had the capability for single-point temperature reading. Customers wanted something with a greater potential for additional uses and customization beyond the limits of a single pixel. Specifically, Adafruit recognized a demand for the ability to make an infrared (IR) camera, which requires the multiple points made available through additional pixels.
> 
> “You’ll see the IR cameras that plug in to phones,” Fried said. “They’re really expensive and super fancy.”
> 
> When Fried discovered the Grid-EYE, she saw the potential to give customers new functionality for a reasonable price. The Grid-EYE’s 8×8 pixels offered just enough detail to detect shapes, identify multiple heat sources, or find the “hot-spot” of an area without having to scan a single pixel across any given space. Furthermore, the sensor was not overly complex in a way that would inflate its price. “It’s really easy to pick and place,” Fried said.
