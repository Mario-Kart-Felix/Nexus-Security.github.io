If you have an [Adafruit IO](https://io.adafruit.com) Feed containing a lot of text (tweets, packed data from one sensor, etc), you can now format and display your feeds on your Adafruit IO dashboard using a multi-line text block!

This block is similar to our regular text block, except you can now add _\\n_ characters to your text to get hard line-breaks in the text element. You can also select the _Preformatted_ option and get monospace (code-like) output from the text block. In case you missed it – we also added an optional static icon to display next to text blocks a few weeks ago – it’s in the multiline text block, too.
