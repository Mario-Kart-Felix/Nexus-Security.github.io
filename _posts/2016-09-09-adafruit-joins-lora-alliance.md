We are thrilled to announce that we have joined the LoRa Alliance! [What is the LoRa Alliance?](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lora-alliance)

> The LoRa Alliance® is an open, nonprofit association that has grown to more than 500 members since its inception in March 2015, becoming the largest and fastest-growing alliance in the technology sector. Its members closely collaborate and share experiences to promote and drive the success of the LoRaWAN® protocol as the leading open global standard for secure, carrier-grade IoT LPWAN connectivity. With the technical flexibility to address a broad range of IoT applications, both static and mobile, and a certification program to guarantee interoperability, LoRaWAN® has already been deployed by major mobile network operators globally, with continuing wide expansion into 2019 and beyond.

Why did we join?

> _“Humans done a great job of connecting people in dense populations like cities or buildings – WiFi and Cellular are ubiquitous technologies that connect people, machines and sensors. The future is to connect people where-ever they are, and that’s where LoRa has so much promise. We think LoRa and LoRaWAN are the best way to solve last-mile connectivity for Industrial and Agricultural IoT”_ – Limor “Ladyada” Fried.

_Ready to learn more?_ There is a plethora of of guides available on the [Adafruit Learning System](https://learn.adafruit.com/search?q=lora) about LoRa/LoRaWAN topics ranging from[ sending packets between radios](https://learn.adafruit.com/lora-and-lorawan-radio-for-raspberry-pi) to [setting up your own decentralized LoRaWAN Network](https://learn.adafruit.com/multi-device-lora-temperature-network).

We’re not just fans of LoRa, we’re also fans of LoRaWAN and The Things Network and have written guides and drivers to simplify joining the Things Network with either [CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-lorawan-and-the-things-network-with-circuitpython) _or_ [Arduino](https://learn.adafruit.com/the-things-network-for-feather) hardware.

Here’s some of the LoRa hardware we manufacture right here in New York City…

> Upgrade your Raspberry Pi with a LoRa / LoRaWAN radio, so it can communicate over very long distances. These bonnets plug right into your Pi and give you long range wireless capabilities to remote nodes that may be battery powered. Or, you can create Internet gateways with ease. You not only get a radio module, but also a 128×32 OLED display for status messages and three buttons you can use for creating a custom user interface or sending test messages. All of the above is supported with our Python libraries so you can send or receive LoRa data with other matching modules, send data to a LoRaWAN gateway, or even set up your own single channel LoRaWAN-to-Internet gateways.

Visit the Adafruit Learning System to learn how to [turn a LoRa Radio Bonnet into a Single Channel LoRaWan Gateway](https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-single-channel-lorawan-gateway), [Communicate with other LoRa/LoRaWAN Radios](https://learn.adafruit.com/lora-and-lorawan-radio-for-raspberry-pi), or [build your own decentralized network of temperature nodes](https://learn.adafruit.com/multi-device-lora-temperature-network).

If you’d like to power-up from this bonnet, we also stock [an 8-channel LoRa Gateway HAT with LoRa and GPS Antenna](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4284) and the official [Things Network Indoor LoRaWAN Gateway](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4345).

Adafruit Feather M0 RFM9x

> Our Feather M0 RFM9x is an all-in-one Feather with an onboard RFM9x radio module cooked in, built-in USB, and battery charging.

If you have Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or any CircuitPython-compatible hardware, **you can easily add LoRa/LoRaWAN to your project** using an [Adafruit RFM9x Radio Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3072) or an [Adafruit LoRa Radio FeatherWing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3231).
