Beginning [last year](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/07/25/adafruit-election-day-is-a-paid-day-off-for-employees-adafruit-adafruit-makethevote/) Adafruit added Election Day as an official holiday. Hopefully more companies will follow suit in the years to come!

All employees are given a paid day off so they can get out and vote!

This means Adafruit will not be shipping orders on Tuesday, November 5, 2019 for Election Day.

**Any orders placed after 11am EST Monday, November 4 will go out Wednesday, November 6.**
