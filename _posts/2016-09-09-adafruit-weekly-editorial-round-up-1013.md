**[The first 2 orders at Adafruitâ€¦ now up to 2,161,166 orders](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/10/13/the-first-2-orders-at-adafruit-now-up-to-2161166-orders-adafruit-ohm2019-oshwa-ohsummit-opensource-opensourcehardware-opensourceorg/)**

When Adafruit started in 2005 we sold 2 open source hardware kits, the x0xb0x and MiniPOV2. You can still find the files to build these two projects at [ladyada.net/make/minipov](http://ladyada.net/make/minipov/download.html) and [ladyada.net/make/x0xb0x](http://ladyada.net/make/x0xb0x/download.html)

I asked Ladyada if we had any of the original orders from about 15 years ago, turns out we have exactly 2 we kept for historic reasons â€“ they are some of the first orders for each of these two kits â€“ that I scanned.
