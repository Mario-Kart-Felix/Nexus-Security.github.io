A Poster of CAD Design Tips for #3DPrinting #CAD @BillieRubenMake

“Maker of many kinds, serial skill-collector, and STEM-student,” [Billie Ruben](https://twitter.com/BillieRubenMake/status/1218496270836256769), has created this very useful little poster of do’s, don’ts, and other design considerations for creating CAD files for 3D printing.

You can download a large version of the poster, along with two other 3DP tips posters she’s created [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/SqIdFwB). While on the Imgur link, don’t forget to check out Billie’s other two posters with more tips on what modeling programs to use for different types of 3DP and the ins and outs of 3D printer bed leveling.

Use your PyPortal to display works of art from the Cleveland Museum of Art

Museums today are expanding public access to their art collections, not just inside the walls of the museum but also outside. Digital initiatives are bringing artwork, once relegated within the confines of the museum, to a 21st century global audience. These modern museums have essentially become the new content providers. Much like the modern companies Netflix and Pandora that provide video and music content, museums are becoming their own content providers with their collection of paintings, photographs, jewelry and other media. Digitizing these collections and making it publicly available brings this material to a global audience.  
One such museum that is at the forefront of this endeavor is the Cleveland Museum of Art.

This project accesses the CMA API using CircuitPython running on the PyPortal. It uses the API to pick a random item from the collection. It converts and resizes the JPEG image from the collection to a BMP image sized to the PyPortal using Adafruit IO image conversion service. Finally, the converted image is downloaded to the PyPortal for display. A new feature of the PyPortal allows the correct scaling of portrait images, which is a great feature for this project.
