ADAFRUIT WEEKLY EDITORIAL ROUND-UP
----------------------------------

* * *

We’ve got so much happening here at Adafruit that it’s not always easy to keep up! Don’t fret, we’ve got you covered. Each week we’ll be posting a handy round-up of what we’ve been up to, ranging from learn guides to blog articles, videos, and more.

[All this month](https://blog.adafruit.com/?s=%23OHM2019) we’ve been posting about open-source hardware, some of the folks who make and share it, and some open-source hardware history. Today’s post is an example of wanting to build something, but not wanting to sell or manufacture it. However! What if you still wanted to share it? Open-source hardware and software, allows you to scratch that itch and avoid being on the hook for actually mass manufacturing something.

Some artists want to make the art and have others distribute it as an efficient and interesting form of expression which in itself is the art. Others want to make art that must and only be viewed in a gallery. And others just want to cause some problems and make you think.

[EZ Make Oven](https://learn.adafruit.com/ez-make-oven)  
Make your own reflow oven with this easy to build project! Soldering through hole components onto printed circuit boards (PCBs) is a very useful skill to have and needed for many DIY projects. However, there are some components that do not have through hole versions and are only available as surface mount versions. Or, a project may need a smaller footprint using smaller components. In these cases, you will need to put aside your solder iron and use a reflow oven.

A reflow oven is used for soldering of surface mount electronic components onto PCBs. In the past, reflow ovens were large, expensive and limited to commercial units. With the popularity of the DIY movement, reflow ovens have come down in size and price to make them affordable to hobbyists. Some of these are available in kit form. Unfortunately, these kits require modifying a toaster oven’s high voltage wiring and can take time to assemble.

The EZ Make Oven is just that: it’s an easy to make reflow oven that requires no high voltage wiring and does not require any disassembly of the oven. The reflow oven can be put together in just a few hours with just some minimal soldering required. [See the full guide here!](https://learn.adafruit.com/ez-make-oven)
