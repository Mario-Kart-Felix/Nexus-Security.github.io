**[PyPortal Retro Cases](https://learn.adafruit.com/pyportal-retro-compys)**

Retro-inspired Enclosures for Adafruit PyPortal IoT Displays. This project is like a mini desktop PC that you can have on your desk and display all sorts of data. The ports are accessible on the side and there’s even a spot to hold a speaker.

The 3D printed enclosure is designed to snap fit so it’s easy to assemble and take apart.
