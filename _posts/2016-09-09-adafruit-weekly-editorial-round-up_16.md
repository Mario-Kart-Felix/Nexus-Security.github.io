[Tree with Animated Eyes and Motion Sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/tree-ent-sculpture-with-animated-eyes) – _Bring Your Forest to life with MonsterM4sk_ by Erin St Blaine

This tutorial goes into detail about the Monster M4sk setup process, and gives a lot of info about how I built the tree to house it. It’s not a step-by-step tree-build tutorial, but it will definitely give you the tools and a road map of how to create your own tree or monster or movie prop using expanding foam and a few simple hand tools.
