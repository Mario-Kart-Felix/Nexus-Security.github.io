[Quickstart using Adafruit eInk/ePaper displays with CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/quickstart-using-adafruit-eink-epaper-displays-with-circuitpython)  
This guide is intended to get you using the Adafruit 2.13″ tri-color e-ink FeatherWing and 2.7″ tri-color e-ink shield quickly with CircuitPython.  
These displays come with headers already soldered on – male headers for the shield version and female headers for the Feather version. This allows them to be plugged in to their respective microcontrollers without soldering. Place on the microcontroller, upload your code and graphics file, and display!
