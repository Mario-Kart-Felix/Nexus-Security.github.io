Great news for students! Adafruit is part of the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://www.adafruit.com/github-students)! What is the [GitHub Student Developer Pack?](https://education.github.com/pack)

> GitHub is committed to students having access to the best real-world tools and training required to get started as developers. As students prepare to return to school for the spring semester, we’re doubling the value of the GitHub Student Developer Pack (the Pack).
> 
> This January, we’re welcoming 22 new partners, increasing the total value of tools and training included to more than $200k per student. And each offer is available to every student developer, anywhere that GitHub is available.
> 
> Whether you’re building your first website, localizing your app for the global market, or even hardware hacking—the Pack provides you with the tools you need to be successful.

[NeoPixel Infinity Cube](https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixel-infinity-cube): Mirrored Acrylic and NeoPixel Magic!

In this project we’re building an Infinity Cube with NeoPixels!

The frame is 3D printed and the acrylic panels are coated with see-through mirror film.

With mirrored acrylic, this creates a really neat effect that’s borderline magic!

LED strips inside the frame light up, making the acrylic appear transparent. There are lots of options for customization, so you can change colors and speed! [Learn more!](https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixel-infinity-cube)
