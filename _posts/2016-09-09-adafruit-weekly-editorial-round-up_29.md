Twinkly Earwarmer Headband  
Sew up a little warmth and seasonal cheer with a string of LEDs or programmable NeoPixels! Nobody likes hat hair, but that’s no reason to let your ears freeze! Earwarmers are the perfect compromise — cute and warm, but plenty of room for your hair to breathe free.  
And by doubling the fabric to create a tube, you’ve got a handy place to hide a small battery holder — enough to power a string of festive LEDs or stitch on some programmable NeoPixels!  
This super-simple project lets you dress up your winter wear three different ways:

1.  Use basic embroidery stitches to add a string of LEDs on a lovely silver wire, no coding required!
2.  Go a little fancier with color-changing NeoPixels controlled by a Gemma M0 programmed in easy-to-learn Microsoft MakeCode.
3.  For a challenge, weave a little CircuitPython magic into the Gemma to tap into a secret temperature sensor that shows you the chill factor in colored NeoPixels.
