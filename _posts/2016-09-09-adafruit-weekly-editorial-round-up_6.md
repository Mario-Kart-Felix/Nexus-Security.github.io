> Today is Manufacturing Day, celebrated the 1st Friday of October. As you may have noticed through our [#ManufacturingMonday](https://blog.adafruit.com/?s=%23ManufacturingMonday) and [Made in NYC](https://blog.adafruit.com/tag/made-in-nyc/) posts we are thrilled to be able to demonstrate that American manufacturing can thrive, even in the heart of New York City.
> 
> With the news of American manufacturing in a slump its good to take a look at the good stories of those resisting the trend. All day today we will be sharing manufacturing stories to the [Adafruit blog.](https://blog.adafruit.com/?s=mfgday)
