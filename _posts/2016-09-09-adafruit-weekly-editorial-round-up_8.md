[All the Internet of Things – Episode Five: The S in IoT is for Security](https://learn.adafruit.com/all-the-internet-of-things-episode-five-the-s-in-iot-is-for-security)

Hello and welcome to episode five of Adafruit and Digi-Key’s “All the Internet of Things”! A six-part series that covers everything you need to know about IoT. This video series has built up from the basics to more advanced topics, as we take you through the journey of IoT best practices. In previous episodes we’ve discussed the transports, protocols, and services you need to craft your IoT functionality. We’ve also showed off working example code for sending and receiving data with MQTT versus REST, and when to use WiFi, cellular and Bluetooth so you can start making the right decisions for which transports and protocols to use.
