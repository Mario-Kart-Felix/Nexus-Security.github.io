[![Adafruit top of the decade blog](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2019/12/adafruit_top_of_the_decade_blog-2.jpg "adafruit_top_of_the_decade_blog.jpg")](https://blog.adafruit.com/tag/adafruit-top-10)

Adafruit joined the Instagram community June 2013 and âœ¨WOW!âœ¨ has this been an adventure!

Weâ€™ve been posting our [Instagram top tens since 2016](https://blog.adafruit.com/?s=%23AdafruitTopTen+instagram) ðŸ¤¯ Since weâ€™ve already seen the top of the last few years, we wanted to spice things up and really embrace this whole ~decade~ thing, so scroll down and join us on this journey as we look through [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/adafruit/?hl=en) as a whole and see which posts have garnered the most attention from the moment of publication through the end of 2019.

ðŸŽ‰ Cheers to another 10 years ðŸŽ‰
