**[Adafruit PyGamer #MakeCode #CircuitPython #Arduino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9gnPC5xUKA)**  
Say hello to the #Adafruit #PyGamer üëæüéÆIt‚Äôs got a cortex M4, 1.8in TFT display with 8 buttons, accelerometer, light sensor and speaker. Also USB charging and JST ports!

It‚Äôs a pretty small device packed with all sorts of hardware.  
It‚Äôs built for creative development and it‚Äôs fully open source!

Guide: [Obsidian Sword ‚Äì Steven Universe Fuse Your Maker Skills](https://learn.adafruit.com/obsidian-sword-steven-universe)

In this project, we‚Äôre building Obsidian‚Äôs Sword from Steven Universe.

This thing was forged from foam core and has a NeoPixel LED strip making it super bright!

**[WebUSB is here! TinyUSB now has WebUSB support at Adafruit!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UU8GRoDw8c)**

Following up on our earlier mass-storage support announcement for TinyUSB, we just added WebUSB support!

You can now send and receive data over Chrome (or other WebUSB) browsers with Javascript or whatever else is your favorite web programming language.

This can make for really interesting interactions where people don‚Äôt need any drivers or software to send/receive commands, or perhaps to expose some sort of REPL.

**[LED Zelda Master Sword](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=za5T2DMwr6s)**

Make a light up Master Sword from the Legend of Zelda! This build has motion activated sound effects and LED animations!

The Adafruit Feather and Prop-Maker FeatherWing has you need to add lights and sounds to your projects. NeoPixel LEDs are fitted inside the blade.

This uses the built-in accelerometer and audio amp. When you swing it around, it‚Äôll make different sound effects. On heavy hits it makes flashes and fade the colors of the LEDs.

It has pulsing animation and an idle sound effect that loops in the background. You can make this fit your project by customizing the colors or adding different sound effects. You can recharge the battery or even add new sounds with the USB port. The sword mounts on a computer, just like a USB Drive!

**[Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpG9r7CMTYs)**

The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is the newest Raspberry Pi computer made, and the Pi Foundation knows you can always make a good thing better! And what could make the Pi 4 better than the 3? How about a faster processor, USB 3.0 ports, and updated Gigabit Ethernet chip with PoE capability? Good guess ‚Äì that‚Äôs exactly what they did!

The Raspberry Pi 4 is the latest product in the Raspberry Pi range, boasting an updated 64-bit quad core processor running at 1.4GHz with built-in metal heatsink, USB 3 ports, dual-band 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless LAN, faster (300 mbps) Ethernet, and PoE capability via a separate PoE HAT.
