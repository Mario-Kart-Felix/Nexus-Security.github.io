It was so fun looking back through the [Adafruit Youtube videos](http://youtube.com/adafruit) of the last decade to compile this list! Lets start with the best – check out our top 1-10 youtube videos of the last decade below!

[Guardian Robot – Zelda Breath of The Wild #3DPrinting #Adafruit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULqynriVAa0)

Since the last Guardian Robot project, we’ve gotten a number of requests to add a servo and LED to the head – In this project, we’ll show you how to do that!

Mounted to the eye is a 10mm blue LED. The head itself is attached to a servo horn and mounted to a micro servo. The head can freely rotate while the eye blink randomly. Surrounding the body are 5mm blue LEDs that illuminate the various surface details.

The random motion of the servo and eye blinks give the illusion of the robot “searching”. It’s appears quite organic and live like, adding much more dimension to this replica.

[Introducing NeoPixels by Adafruit!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO6xQMR8naw)  
[http://www.adafruit.com/neopixel](http://www.adafruit.com/neopixel)

Adding colorful LEDs to your project used to require a lot of pins on your microcontroller and complex code. With the Adafruit NeoPixels, those problems are a thing of the past. You only need one pin on any microcontroller to run a long string of pixels, and with our open source NeoPixel library, you can get your NeoPixels up and running in seconds.

Not only are NeoPixels easy to use, but they come in a wide variety of designs to fit your project. You can get NeoPixels in sewable form, long waterproof strips, in a ring, on an Arduino shield, on a stick, breadboard friendly and much more! Learn everything there is to know about Adafruit NeoPixels and how easy it is to use them on the Adafruit Learning System.
