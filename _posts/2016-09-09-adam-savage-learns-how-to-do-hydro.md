I have always been fascinated by hydro dipping, the process of adding a pattern to a three-dimensional object using a water-slide transfer film. This technique is used a lot in car, motorcycle, and boat customizing. The technique isn’t all that complicated, but the apparent skill involved in getting a good transfer has always intimidated me.

In this latest _Tested_ video, Adam Savage lets Jen Schachter show him how she created the 3D-printed hydro-dipped “carbon fiber” grips for the blaster handles on Adam’s Star Lord Comic Con costume. Jen breaks down the process in a very approachable fashion, and as with most _Tested_ videos, there are lots of great tips and words of wisdom shared. After watching this, I feel like I’m ready to give it a go.
