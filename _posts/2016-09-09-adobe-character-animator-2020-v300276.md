Animate in real time. Really. Create a character and animate it with your own performance. Character Animator uses your expressions and movements to animate your characters in real-time. So when you smile or nod your head, your character does, too. It’s so fast, you can even stream your animations live.  
Eye-opening animations. In eye-opening time.  
Create animations for cartoons, an animated series, and live broadcasts. Or live stream your character on social media and wow your friends.

Create a character in seconds.  
Turn any piece of art into an animated character using your webcam and new Characterizer, powered by Adobe Sensei AI. Or create characters by modifying the built-in character templates available in Character Animator, or importing art from Illustrator or Photoshop.

Put your best face forward.  
Easily bring your character to life through your own performance. Using your webcam and microphone, Character Animator matches your expressions — from syncing lips to tracking eyes and facial features — to animate your character in real time. Look surprised, happy, or angry and your character does, too.

Animations with legs — and arms and heads.  
Getting your character to move doesn’t take a lot of work. Control gestures like waving with your keyboard or MIDI device. Movements can be saved as buttons, so they’re easier to remember than key commands.

It’s showtime.  
Check out the Hollywood studios, broadcasters, and online content creators who use Character Animator to bring their characters to life in real time. The app is powerfully fast and integrates with other Adobe apps for a seamless animation workflow. So you can take your own characters live or bring them into Premiere Pro or After Effects to include in bigger projects. It’s the next generation of animation tools. Available now.

Animate in seconds with Characterizer  
Create a stylized, animated character using a work of art, your webcam, and Characterizer. Powered by Adobe Sensei AI technology, Characterizer quickly and easily turns art into animations.

Easily re-use your best takes  
The new Replays feature lets you choose your best laugh or perfectly timed fist bump and create a trigger that you can re-use live or in your next recording. Adjust the length of your Replays trigger to easily fit into your scene.

Magnets to make your animations livelier  
Now your puppet can throw, drop, pick up static items, and do things like drink from a cup or drop a ball.

Improvements to walking behavior  
Newly added right and left shoulder and hip tags make a three-quarter drawn character look better when walking.
