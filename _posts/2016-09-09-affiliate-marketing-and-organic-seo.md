**Description**  
Affiliate marketing is one of the largest, most time-tested and proven business models on the Internet. It is also the most misunderstood.  
LEARN THE PROPER SKILLS necessary to build an affiliate marketing business from scratch, from your computer!  
This course is a solid, step-by-step system with clear, easy to follow instructions. We fast track you from knowing nothing to knowing the fundamentals of affiliate marketing and Organic SEO in JUST ONE AFTERNOON!  
Companies need traffic. They need customers, they need sales and they need growth. It doesn’t matter how big a company is, they can’t do everything themselves. Even Amazon needs help.  
You act as a commissioned salesperson who drives traffic to the business you have a relationship with. The only thing you’re responsible for is finding the traffic … and then converting that traffic to sales.  
My name is Chris Molnar, part of the OMC team with Tim Godfrey and Aidan Booth, and I have been building affiliate websites since 2005. Over several hundred sites in dozens of niches, I have witnessed all the Google changes through the years, but one thing has always remained constant … the need to offer valuable content to solve people’s problems. That is all affiliate marketing is.  
I have dabbled in the black hat and white hat SEO, and if there’s one piece of advice I can give to new students … if you want a stable business with sustainable results … do not cheat and take short cuts!  
  
In this course, I lay the solid foundations of a real business for the long term. After following this course and following the instructions, you can have an income stream that can last for years with little maintenance … true, passive, automated income.
