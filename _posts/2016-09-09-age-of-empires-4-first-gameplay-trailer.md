During Microsoft's X019 stream, it showed the first gameplay trailer for [Age of Empires 4](https://www.gamespot.com/age-of-empires-iv/), which was first announced more than two years ago. The trailer showed a variety of units like warriors, knights, cavalry, and catapults in a massive castle siege scene. You can watch it for yourself below.

The stage presentation also included an interview with Shannon Loftis, who is heading up the newly dubbed studio World's Edge. She pointed out that the trailer debuts two of the big reveals for this game. The first is when the game is set--it takes place during the medieval era. Microsoft also confirmed the first two civilizations that will be represented in the game, and they're on display during the trailer: the Mongols and English.

Age of Empires IV is in development at Relic, the studio responsible for the Company of Heroes series. Microsoft also confirmed that its recently formed, dedicated Age of Empires studio is named World's Edge, and it's headed up Shannon Loftis.

Also as part of the Age of Empires announcements, Microsoft announced the [release of Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/age-of-empires-2-definitive-edition-out-now-for-pc/1100-6471454/). It's out now on PC, including Steam.
