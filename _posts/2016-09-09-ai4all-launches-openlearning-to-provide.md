AI4ALL announces the release of ‘Open Learning’ for educators and community program leaders on Twitter.

In honor of [Ada Lovelace Day 2019](https://findingada.com/), AI4ALL [announced](https://twitter.com/ai4allorg/status/1181539850866106376) the release of “[AI4ALL Open Learning](https://ai4all.docebosaas.com/pages/14/homepage)“. [AI4ALL](http://ai-4-all.org/) started at Stanford in 2015 as the “SAILORS” program and was co-founded by [Dr. Fei-Fei Li](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/03/15/dr-fei-fei-li-whm19-womenshistorymonth-womeninstem/) and [Dr. Olga Russakovsky](https://blog.adafruit.com/2017/10/10/dr-olga-russakovsky-ald17-findingada/). The program has expanded to include partnerships with a number of academic institutions. With the launch of ‘Open Learning’ it is now available to all teachers and community leaders.

> AI4ALL Open Learning is designed to equip educators and community members to empower high school students with relevant and approachable AI education. The program can be incorporated into the classroom, a club, or a workshop and provides 30+ hours of free curriculum with facilitator guides.

Open Learning is meant to introduce learners to AI without requiring any background in programming or math. It contains 5 units that can be mixed and matched to create a course with 10, 20 or 30 hours of instruction. All of the courses include unit plans and facilitation guidelines and hit on a number of important topics (including AI careers and AI design).

> #### Students Will Learn:
> 
> *   What AI and Machine Learning are
> *   Who some role models in AI are
> *   The benefits and risks of AI and Machine Learning to the world and to themselves
> *   How they can be involved in the world of AI and Machine Learning
