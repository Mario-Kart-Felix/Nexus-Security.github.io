There is no doubt that Apple’s AirPods have evolved to be a tech-lifestyle accessory rather than being just a pair of wireless earbuds. A recent report from Bloomberg suggests that the shipments of AirPods are expected to **double up to 60 million in 2019**.  

As Bloomberg [reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-22/apple-airpods-shipments-are-said-to-double-to-60-million-in-2019), this is happening because of a “much higher” than expected demand for the [AirPods Pro](https://beebom.com/airpods-pro-announced-price-features-availability/) that retails at a whopping $249 or Rs. 24,900 in India. Clearly, people gave a warm welcome to the Cupertino giant’s first noise-canceling earbuds.  

However, achieving that target depends on the assemblers and production units of Apple. It remains to be seen how the company manages to pull-off this increasing demand. Right now, AirPods are manufactured by Taiwan-based Inventec Corp, China’s Luxshare Precision Industry,  and Goertek Inc. for Apple.  

The demand for AirPods is not declining anytime soon. In fact, as per the [survey](https://beebom.com/gen-z-teens-want-airpods-christmas-survey/) conducted by Piper Jaffray, AirPods are the most desired tech product by teenagers this holiday season. It is indeed surprising to see such demand for a pair of wireless earbuds that can [hardly be repaired](https://beebom.com/apple-airpods-pro-teardown-repair-report/) in case something goes wrong.  

This trend would certainly hurt the competitive offerings like [Samsung’s Galaxy Buds](https://beebom.com/galaxy-buds-tops-headphones-test/) and [Sony WF-1000XM3](https://beebom.com/sony-wf-1000xm3-noise-cancelling-wireless-earbuds-launched/). However, it will be interesting to see how the AirPods Pro stacks up against Google’s upcoming [Pixel Buds 2](https://beebom.com/google-pixel-buds-2-specs-price-launch-date/) and Microsoft’s upcoming [Surface Buds](https://beebom.com/microsoft-surface-earbuds-announced-with-gestures-office-365-support/).
