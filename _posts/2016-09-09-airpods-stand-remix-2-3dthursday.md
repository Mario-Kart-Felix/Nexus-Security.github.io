> Here is a Remix of the very cool AirPods Stand by Mathijs Boogaert. I extended the base to allow for a generous cable bending radius. The longer base allowed me to add some cable management to the exit. The opening for the lightning cable matches the shape of the stock cable provided by Apple. I was tempted to glue the lightning cable in place but I ended up wetting a piece of tissue paper and stuffing it in behind the connector. Once the paper dried it stayed in place and allowed me to remove it if necessary.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And donâ€™t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
