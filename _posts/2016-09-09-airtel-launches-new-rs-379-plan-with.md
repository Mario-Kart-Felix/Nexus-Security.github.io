![](https://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/airtel-logo-new.jpg) Airtel has launched new Rs. 379 plan that offers truly unlimited calls and 84 days validity, but this doesn't offer daily data, instead users only get 6GB of data and 900 SMS. It also includes Airtel Xstream App Premium, Wynk Music and cashback on FASTag. This is similar to Vodafone's plan that offer similar benefits at the same cost, but with 1000 SMS. Reliance Jio offers the plan at Rs. 329, but it only offers Jio to Jio Unlimited calling, and bundles Jio to Non-Jio FUP of 3000 minutes. In addition, Airtel has also launched a new Rs. 279 plan with truly unlimited calling, 1.5 GB/day, 100 SMS/day with 28 days validity, which is similar to Rs. 248 / 249 plan that was launched last month, but this includes Rs 4 Lakh Life Insurance cover from HDFC Life in addition to Airtel Xstream App Premium, Wynk Music subscription and cashback on FASTag. These plans are available for recharge on Airtel website, app and other methods. Airtel recently revised its Rs. 558 prepaid plan that now offers 56 days validity instead of 82 days that was offered prior to tariff revision.
