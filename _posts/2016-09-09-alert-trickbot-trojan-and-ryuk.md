And also, just in time for the holidays when they'll be shopping extensively. Thus, the Japanese consumers should be wary of these infections as they target banks, online shopping payment cards, telecommerce, a bitcoin exchange, e-wallets, and others. TrickBot has been loaded with hundreds of targeted URLs belonging to banks and other retailers. Emotet botnet is also dropping TrickBot to other devices.  
  
The most common attack includes web injections on bank websites leading to banking frauds. On-the-fly injections, used by TrickBot lures the victim into revealing personally identifiable information (PII), payment card details and PIN codes. This is not the first time Eastern European gangs attacked the country, other trojans like URLZone and Gozi (Ursnif) have been prevalent in Japan for years now. For Japanese Businessmen - Beware! Not only TrickBot but Ryuk Ransomware is also spreading through the region TrickBot, being already a worrisome banking plague is not only limited to that.  
  
The Japanese companies should also be wary of the growing ransomware attacks because the TrickBot can usher in Ryuk Ransomware Attacks along with it. It's a kill chain that starts with Emotet and TrickBot and leads to Ryuk attack, ransomware that locks the system demanding millions of dollars. If such Ryuk or TrickBot attack is suspected, then you should immediately launch response plans and contain the infection or contact security companies without wasting precious time as these infections spread fast and wide.
