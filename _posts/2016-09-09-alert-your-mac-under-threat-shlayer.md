Kaspersky reports that Macs have become a hot target for a dangerous malware - SHLAYER, been active for two years this malware-infected 10 percent of MacOS, affecting more than one in ten users.  
  
“The Shlayer Trojan is the most common threat on macOS,” Kaspersky Labs reported on Jan 23, 2020. The users from France, Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom become the top target of Shlayer in 2019.  
  
As for what is Shlayer, Seals said, "Shlayer is a trojan downloader, which spreads via fake applications that hide its malicious code...Its main purpose is to fetch and install various adware variants. "These second-stage samples bombard users with ads, and also intercept browser searches in order to modify the search results to promote yet more ads."  
  
As per the report by Kaspersky, after the malware is installed on the system it displays chains of advertisement, recovering advertisement revenue and slowing your Mac. “The macOS platform is a good source of income for cybercriminals,” warns Kaspersky. However, “the most widespread threats are linked to illicit advertising,” reassures the report.  
  
**Hides behind fake updates**  
  
The malware enters your system through fake flash updates, fooling the victim into installing the update and paving the way into your Mac. Many illegal streaming websites are filled with these fake updates. You may have encountered streaming websites asking for flash updates before playing the video, this malware hides behind such adverts.  
  
"Our statistics show that the majority of Shlayer attacks are against users in the U.S. (31%), followed by Germany (14%), France (10%), and the UK (10%). This is wholly consistent with the terms and conditions of partner programs that deliver the malware, and with the fact that almost all sites with fake Flash Player download pages had English-language content", Kaspersky reports.  
  
These fake updates could also be present on some legitimate websites, so be careful while downloading any updates.
