Amazon is adding more liveliness to Alexa’s voice. Starting earlier this week, the tech giant announced that developers can enable a feature that makes Alexa sound in a  “happy/excited” or “disappointed/empathetic” tone in the US.  

The company recommends using this new happy/excited tone in a scenario where the user correctly answers a trivia question or wins a game. On the other hand, disappointed/empathetic tone is suggested for letting users know sad or disheartening news.  

In addition, Alexa can now respond in a speaking style specific to the content. Notably, Amazon added an Australian news accent specific to users in Australia. _“Speaking styles are curated text-to-speech voices designed to create a more delightful customer experience for specific content. For example, the news speaking style makes Alexa’s voice sound similar to what you hear from TV news anchors and radio hosts.”,_ states Amazon’s [blog post](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2019/11/new-alexa-emotions-and-speaking-styles).  

The company mentions that its news style was perceived to be 31% more natural than Alexa’s standard voice. **For the music style, people found Alexa’s new voice to be 84% more natural** than the standard voice.
