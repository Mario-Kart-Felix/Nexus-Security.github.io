[minihannah](https://www.instructables.com/member/minihannah/) built an Alexa-controlled pumpkin which uses a combination of [Adafruit IO](http://io.adafruit.com/) and [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/adafruit) to trigger lights connected to an Adafruit Feather M0 WiFi.

> All the lights in my house are smart so I’ve got pretty used to yelling at them to switch on and off, but it ends up making me look dumb when I yell at a light that isn’t. And I look especially dumb when yelling at candles.

> Normally this isn’t too much of a problem, but come Halloween I’ve always got a pumpkin carving or two illuminated by candle light. So I figured, why not swap out the inefficient fire-hazard of an analog light source and craft a high-tech pumpkin, powered by LED lights and controlled by Alexa.
