> Researchers in Japan and the University of Michigan [this week announced](https://lightcommands.com/)that they’ve discovered a way to compromise Siri, Google Assistant, Facebook Portal, and Alexa digital home assistants from hundreds of feet away using laser light and even ordinary flashlights.
> 
> The problem stems from a vulnerability in the MEMS (microelectro-mechanical systems) microphones used by home assistant products by all major companies. According to the researchers, the poorly understood vulnerability allows attackers to remotely inject inaudible and invisible commands into light beams, which can then be used to control the voice assistants.
