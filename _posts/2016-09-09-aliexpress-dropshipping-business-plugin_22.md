After a slew of leaks over the past few days, Huawei has finally launched the Honor 20 Lite in China. The device, however, differs significantly from the global Honor 20 Lite model [that was launched](https://beebom.com/honor-20-series-arrives/) alongside the Honor 20 and Honor 20 Pro earlier in the year. Unlike the global version, the Chinese model comes with an in-display fingerprint scanner, alongside a slightly larger screen, a faster processor and an upgraded triple-camera setup at the back.  

Honor 20 Lite (China Variant) Specs and Features
------------------------------------------------

  

The Honor 20 Lite (China variant) features a 6.3-inch FHD+ OLED display with a teardrop notch that houses a 16MP (f/2.0) selfie shooter. The device is powered by the Kirin 710F SoC, and comes with up to 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage with microSD support (up to 256GB). There’s a triple camera setup on the rear, which includes a 48MP (f/1.8) primary camera, an 8MP (f/2.4) ultra wide-angle snapper and an additional 2MP sensor.  

The Honor 20 Lite rocks a 4,000mAh battery with a 10C/2A bundled charger. Connectivity options include a 3.5mm AUX socket, dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 ac, Bluetooth 5, GPS, AGPS, USB OTG and more. The phone runs EMUI 9.1.1 based on Android 9 Pie.  

Honor 20 Lite Price and Availability
------------------------------------

  

The Honor 20 Lite (China variant) is priced starting at 1,399 yuan (around Rs. 14,000) for the base 4GB + 64GB model and goes up to 1,899 yuan (around Rs. 19,000) for the top-end 8GB + 128GB variant. It’s significantly lower than the global model that’s priced at 299 euros (around Rs. 23,000) in Europe. It will be available in three color options – Magic Night Black, Blue Water Jade and Icelandic Fantasy.
