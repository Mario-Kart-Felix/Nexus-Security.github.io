Learned all The Emoji Meanings?
-------------------------------

  

I have tried to explain all the important emoji meanings that you need to know to converse on a day to day basis. The emojis you will be. using the most will generally be the face and smiley emojis and hence I have explained them in greater detail than other emojis on this list. Still, there are more and more emojis being added everyday and if some of them confuse you, drop them down in the comments section below and we will be happy to explain them to you.  

I love using emojis as they allow me to type faster while also allowing me to express myself in a better way. If you want something different, you can try [Animojis or AR Emojis](https://beebom.com/how-get-iphone-x-animoji-android/) which map your expressions to a live emojis thus allowing you to create a more natural expression. Nearly all the Android manufacturers including [Google](https://beebom.com/gboard-personalized-emoji/), [Samsung](https://beebom.com/samsung-to-improve-ar-emojis-with-more-customization-options-better-motion-tracking/), [Huawei](https://beebom.com/huwei-copied-animojis-face-id/) and more are including it and you should not have any problem in finding this feature on your phone. Plus, if you want, you can also [create custom emojis](https://beebom.com/custom-emoji-builder-tool) to share with your friends and family.  

But that’s just me, let us know your thoughts on emojis. Do you hate them or love them? Drop your thoughts about emojis and their meanings in the comments section below.
