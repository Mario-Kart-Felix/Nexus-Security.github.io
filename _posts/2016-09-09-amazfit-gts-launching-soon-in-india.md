After launching the incredibly Apple Watch-like Amazfit GTS in China back in August, Huami is gearing up to launch the watch in India in partnership with Amazon.  

The Amazfit GTS comes with a **1.65-inch Super Retina Grade AMOLED screen**, a custom modular dial, metal body, and 14 days of battery life — all of which sounds really impressive. It can track 12 different kinds of activities, and even has a PPG Bio-tracking optical **heart rate sensor, GPS, and up to 5ATM water resistance** — which is about 50 metres.  

Here are the complete specs for the Amazfit GTS:
