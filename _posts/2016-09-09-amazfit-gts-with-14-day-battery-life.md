Huami has today launched its Apple Watch-like smartwatch, the Amazfit GTS in India. The smartwatch comes with a 1.65-inch Super Retina Grade AMOLED display along with a custom modular dial, and 14 days of battery life.  

The Amazfit GTS is capable of tracking 12 different types of activities, and comes with a PPG optical heart rate sensor and GPS, and it’s water resistant up to 5ATM (which is around 50 metres) so you can easily take it for a swim, or use it in the rain without worrying about it.  

Speaking at the launch event for the watch, Huami’s VP of Overseas Business Mark Mao said, _“The year 2019 has been an excellent year for Amazfit so far. We have received a phenomenal response from the Indian market on all our recent launches – Bip Lite, Verge Lite & GTR. We are extremely excited to launch GTS in India, elegantly crafted with a sleek and chic display. GTS is specially designed for millennials who are both fitness enthusiasts and fashion connoisseurs. With the festive season around, we have a high expectation from the Indian market. We are looking forward to witnessing massive consumer trust & response from the Indian market and hope to be among the top preferred smartwatches in India.”_
