> Amazon has announced a new addition to its Amazon Future Engineer program – [a music remix competition](https://www.amazonfutureengineer.com/earsketch) that teaches students how to write code that makes music. Alongside Georgia Tech and their learn-to-code-through music platform, EarSketch, participating high school students have the opportunity to win prizes by composing an original remix featuring original music stems from Grammy Award winning singer/songwriter [Ciara](https://twitter.com/ciara/status/1196820429748334592) and her song, “SET” from her latest album Beauty Marks. The competition is intended to uniquely activate young people to try computer science and coding. All high school students across the country are encouraged to [enter](https://www.amazonfutureengineer.com/earsketch) the competition now through January 20th. Teaching guides are available for teachers to bring the competition to their classroom, or as part of their introductory computer science curriculum.
