Referring to anonymous sources, a British daily newspaper came up with reports on details regarding Amazon Chief Jeff Bezos' cell phone being hacked in the wake of accepting a message from the Saudi Arabian crown.  
  
Theft of information from Bezo's cell phone, however, is said to have been started in 2018 with a contaminated video file sent by means of WhatsApp from the personal account of Mohammed bin Salman, according to the previously mentioned British daily.  
  
The report apparently comes about a year after the unexpected announcement that Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, would separate following 25 years of marriage. The National Enquirer along these lines uncovered an extramarital affair between Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, a former TV anchor, in a progression of reports that depended, to some degree, on some intimate text messages sent by Bezos.  
  
Bezos in this way distributed an extraordinary blog entry blaming the newspaper for taking steps to distribute all the more humiliating text messages and photographs except if he freely attested that there was no political motivation or outside force behind the newspaper's coverage.  
  
Gavin de Becker, a security consultant for Bezos, later said he believed the Saudi Arabian government had gained access to Bezos' phone before the Enquirer uncovered the whole affair. He didn't give any immediate evidence to back up his claims, which he said originated from "our investigators and a few experts." De Becker referred to the Enquirer's business association with the Saudis, just as the intense coverage of the homicide of a critic of the Saudi regime by the Bezos-owned Washington Post, as reasons why bin Salman may look to harm the Amazon founder.  
  
The newspaper reported a year ago that the Central Intelligence Agency connected the crown prince to the 2018 murder of Post Columnist Jamal Khashoggi. De Becker declined to remark past the rather lengthy statement a year ago, which was posted on the news site The Daily Beast.  
  
The Saudi embassy didn't quickly react to a message looking for more inputs. In spite of the fact, it's still extremely unclear whether the supposed hack of Bezos' phone got to any sensitive Amazon corporate information.  
  
While the company is yet to remark on the issue in the nine months since de Becker's allegation, the company representatives haven’t yet returned the messages seeking comment on the 21st of January.
