Technology giant Amazon has announced new wearable products ; all using its Alexa voice assistant of course.

The firm announced an Echo Loop smart ring, wireless earbuds, Echo Frames smart glasses as well as a nifty pet tracker called the Ring Fetch.

According to the BBC, the new devices will join a raft of new devices for the home which will give Amazon a real advantage over its competitors. The wearable devices are –

*   Echo Frames – a pair of titanium-framed glasses that vibrate to provide notifications, and have built-in microphones and speakers to use Alexa, but no display
*   Echo Buds – a pair of wireless Bluetooth earbuds that feature noise-reduction tech, giving them an edge over Apple’s Airpods, and which can activate the firm’s virtual assistant by voice alone, unlike other Alexa-enabled headphones
*   Echo Loop – a ring that features two microphones and a “tap-on” button, which allows owners to record messages and send them to an Echo smart speaker
*   Fetch – a pet tracker designed to attach to a dog collar
