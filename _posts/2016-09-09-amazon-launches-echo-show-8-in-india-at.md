Amazon globally announced the Echo Show 8 along with a whole bunch of Echo devices at the [Amazon hardware event](https://beebom.com/here-are-all-the-echo-devices-announced-at-amazons-hardware-event/) last September and now, the tech giant has finally brought the smart display to India.  

The Echo Show 8 has an **8-inch HD display** that supports touch input. The gadget measures 200mm x 135mm x 99mm and weighsÂ 1037 grams. The smart display equips **2-inch neodymium speakers with passive bass radiator**, dual-band Wi-Fi, a 1MP front camera, and a 3.5mm audio output.  

The front camera equipped on the Echo Show 8 **comes with a built-in physical shutter** so that you can keep it closed whenever you want without risking your privacy. The shutter button is mounted on the top right corner of the device.
