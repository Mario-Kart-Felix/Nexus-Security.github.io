Amazon has launched a new Kindle for kids. Called Kindle Kids Edition, the new Kindle for kids is perfect for children who love to read. You’ll pay a little extra than you would for a regular Kindle, but in return you’ll receive some kid-friendly extras.

What Is the Kindle Kids Edition?
--------------------------------

According to [the press release](https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-announces-new-kindle-kids-edition-fire-hd-10-kids-edition), the Kids Edition comprises “the latest Kindle, a kid-friendly case, one year of Amazon FreeTime Unlimited, and a 2-year worry-free guarantee”. This means Amazon will replace the device for free if anything happens to it.

Amazon explained its thinking, saying, “First, kids want a device experience designed just for them; second, parents don’t want to worry about the content their kids are viewing; and third, parents want tools they can trust to help manage their kids’ device usage.”

As well as the case, guarantee, and subscription to FreeTime Unlimited, Kindle Kids Edition comes with “features that encourage kids to build their skills as they go.” These include:

**Achievement Badges:** Kids get pre-defined goals to work towards, and earn badges when they make progress.

**Easy Discovery:** An enhanced search engine helps kids locate titles without using the correct spelling. And smart recommendations help kids find books related to the authors, titles, and genres they know they already love.

**Wise Words:** This feature provides simple definitions above difficult words, helping them carry on reading without having to keep stopping.

**Dictionary:** A built-in Kindle dictionary allows kids to look up other words they either don’t recognize or understand.

**Vocabulary Builder:** When kids look up words in the dictionary they will be added to the Vocabulary Builder and turned into flashcards.

**Kid-Friendly Wallpaper:** The Kindle Kids Edition comes with a unique set of lockscreen wallpapers designed for children.
