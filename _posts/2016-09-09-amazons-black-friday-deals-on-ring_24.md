Amazon has shared a long list of its devices that are cheaper for [Black Friday](https://www.theverge.com/black-friday). If you’ve been looking for a deal on a tablet, Kindle e-reader, smart security camera, Echo speaker, or smart display, these might appeal to you.

  

Like the other major retailers, Amazon usually goes big for the shopping season, so you can expect even more deals once Black Friday and Cyber Monday arrive. We’ll be monitoring this page to ensure that pricing is accurate.
