LED cubes are all the rage right now, and rightly so given the amount of work that goes into them and the interesting things people find to do with them. Not content to make yet another position-sensitive display or an abstract design, though, \[Greig Stewart\] opted for something a bit more ambitious: [an LED cube with a playable game of _Castlevania_.](https://www.element14.com/community/community/halloween/blog/2019/10/31/nes-castlevania-on-an-led-matrix-cube)

As ambitious projects often do, this one required leveraging the previous art, some of which we’ve featured before. \[Greig\] pulled inspiration and information from cube builders like [\[polyfloyd\]](https://hackaday.com/2019/04/30/opengl-shaders-and-an-led-cube/), [\[Greg Davill\]](https://hackaday.com/2019/09/05/handmade-led-cube-is-a-work-of-art/), and [\[kbob\]](https://hackaday.com/2019/09/05/this-led-cube-is-one-heck-of-an-icebreaker/) to put the six 64-LED matrix panels to work. Getting the structural elements figured out was an early stumbling block, but \[Greig\] pulled it off with 3D-printed brackets and a hinge that’s a work of art in itself; the whole thing looks like something the Borg would have built. The Raspberry Pi inside made a Gameboy emulator possible, and his first stab at it was to have six different games running at once, one on each panel. He settled on just one game, the classic side-scroller _Castlevania_, played on just four of the panels. Some wizardry was required to de-scroll the game so that the character walks around the cube rather than having the background scroll; you can check out the results in the clip below.

Currently, the cube sits on a lazy susan with a small motor controlling the swiveling in response to a foot control. \[Greig\] wants to put the motor under control of the game so that physical scrolling is synced with gameplay; we heartily endorse that plan and look forward to the results.
