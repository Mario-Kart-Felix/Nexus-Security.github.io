In view of recent reports, China and the US have taken their technology war to court. Now, the US firms allege that the telecom colossus, Huawei has been planning to rip them off of their technology for “decades”.  
  
Hence, the American organizations decided to expand the premises of their lawsuit against the Chinese mega-company.  
  
The prosecuting attorney mentioned that Huawei did indeed violate the terms of the contract with the companies of the US by stealing robot technology, trade secrets and such.  
  
Per sources, Huawei has straightaway denied all the allegations and has cited that the US is merely threatened by the competition and hence are trying to run down the name of Huawei.  
  
Per newspaper reports, the mega smartphone maker’s chief financial officer and the founder’s daughter are held captive in Canada, struggling against extradition.  
  
According to sources, there are charges of fraud and “sanctions violations” on the founder’s daughter, which she has waved off and denied.  
  
Huawei pretty strong-headedly is maintaining that this lawsuit and the charges on the company are trivial attempts at tarnishing the reputation of their company and attempts at depleting stakes of competition.  
  
Per reports, the fresh accusations of the US against Huawei include trade secret embezzlement, racketeering and even sending spies to obtain confidential information.  
  
Sources reveal, that the persecution attorney also said that Huawei with its stolen data cut both times and cost in the research and development for the company which helped it climb the steps faster than the others.  
  
Per Huawei, the newer charges are just another way of bringing up older claims. Nevertheless, it doesn’t look like the US plan to withdraw their claims or the lawsuit in the near future or at all.  
  
This technological rift has a strong possibility of transforming into a political dispute between America and China. The US is forcing countries like the UK to pull back their support from Huawei, continuing to say that the equipment could be used by China for spying.  
  
Relations between China and the US are down a very flimsy and unpredictable road. All the same, the UK still continues its business ties with Huawei but with possible limits.
