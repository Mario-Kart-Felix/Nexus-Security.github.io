Megastar [Amitabh Bachchan](https://twitter.com/SrBachchan) has unveiled the work of author Ashish Kaul’s latest penned “[Didda - The Warrior Queen of Kashmir”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didda).

  

The book is a tribute not just to the warrior queen, but it also salutes the courage Didda showed from the beginning. Unlike many warrior princess or Queens, Didda was an abandoned child by her parents.

  

Born in 925 AD, the beautiful princess Didda not only won over death, but also survived after being pushed into Sati. The courageous flesh also went on to create the world’s first commando force, counter-intelligence mechanism and invented the deadly Guerrilla warfare strategy.

  

The untold story of a woman’s rise to power during the 10th century, the legend of Didda is entwined with the life of solitary struggles against the prejudice and patriarchy.

  

She overcomes her physical disability and rises to crush the mutiny by the Prime Minister to take control of a kingdom on the verge of disintegration. She makes sure to ensure the Kingdom transforms into one of the largest and most feared kingdoms.

  

She eventually went on to rule the unified Kashmir encompassing the Lohar Kingdom and Kashmir for a period of 44 years, taking it to glorious heights and making it the most powerful kingdom in medieval Asia.

  

The foundation laid by Didda helped Kashmir defeat the dreaded warlord, Mahmood of Gaznavi twice.

  

“It was extremely overwhelming to have Amit Ji do the honours despite his extremely busy schedule and year-long prior commitments. Didda - The Warrior Queen of Kashmir is the greatest daughter of India who guarded undivided India for 44 years. It was only natural for me to request time from India's greatest son. History has been unkind to women who yield tremendous power; Didda too was erased from history because men could not accept her genius. Amit ji's support is a milestone in my endeavour of bringing forth the forgotten glory of the legendary women of Kashmir," said Kaul.
