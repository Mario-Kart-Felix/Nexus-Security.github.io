Playing classic games on the real hardware is an experience many of us enjoy, but sometimes the hardware is just a bit _too_ retro for modern sensibilities. A case in point is the miserable monochrome LCD that was originally installed in the Amstrad PPC640 portable 8086 PC that \[Drygol\] recently picked up. He decided that his portable Amstrad sessions would be far more enjoyable if he [swapped it out for a display that didn’t have 30+ years on the clock](https://retrohax.net/amstrad-ppc640-modshax/).

To quell the complaints of any of the vintage hardware aficionados out there, it’s worth mentioning that the original LCD was actually damaged and needed to be replaced anyway. Granted \[Drygol\] could have tried to find a contemporary panel to replace it with, but looking at the incredible before and after shots of the modded PPC640, it’s hard to argue he didn’t make the right decision by throwing a modern display into the otherwise largely original computer.

Getting the new LCD’s PCB ready for installation.

\[Drygol\] says he picked up a cheap 4:3 LCD TV on eBay, and as luck would have it, found that the new panel dropped perfectly into the original frame. Getting it buttoned back up required the removal of the RF can and all the female connections on the TV’s PCB, plus he had to cut some holes in the back of the display enclosure to mount the LCD’s controls, but overall it looks very stock.

Of course, getting the new LCD display in the original frame was only half the battle, it still needs to be connected up to the computer somehow. To get everyone playing nicely with each other, \[Drygol\] is using a commercially available MDA/CGA/EGA to VGA converter that is installed where the batteries would have gone originally. Wired to the PPC640’s external monitor connector, it allows him to drive the new display without having to use the original LCD interface.

\[Drygol\] has made something of a name for himself by performing some of the most impressive restorations and modifications of retro hardware in recent memory. From the unbelievable work that went into [repairing a smashed Atari 800XL case](https://hackaday.com/2018/07/15/incredible-atari-800xl-case-restoration/) to his [gorgeous custom Amiga A500](https://hackaday.com/2019/10/11/extreme-refurbishing-amiga-edition/), his projects are sure to please the retro hardware lovers in the audience.
