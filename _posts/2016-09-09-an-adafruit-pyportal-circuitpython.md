NanoDano [posts on Dev\_Dungeon](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/pyportal-circuitpy-tutorial-adabox-011) an extensive tutorial on using the [Adafruit PyPortal smart display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4116) with [CircuitPython](https://www.circuitpython.org/).

> The [PyPortal](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4116) is an awesome little IoT device that is programmable with [CircuitPython](https://www.circuitPython.org/). It’s got WiFi, a color touch screen, a speaker and speaker connector, microSD card slot, 8MB flash memory, a light sensor, a temperature sensor, a NeoPixel LED, a few JST connectors, and more!
> 
> You can buy a PyPortal at [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4116) (and resellers). This tutorial covers the PyPortal that came in AdaBox011. I don’t believe there are any differences between the AdaBox version and the one you can buy separately from the shop. _Ed: no difference, although the PyPortal line has been expanded to include the [PyPortal Pynt](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4465) (smaller) and [PyPortal Titano](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4444) (larger)._
> 
> In this tutorial we will take a look at the various components and how to use them in CircuitPython with code examples for each. After following the tutorial you should have a solid grasp on the PyPortal.

The tutorial has extensive instructions and code samples.
