This week Shawn Kovalchick came by the [Adafruit Show and Tell](https://learn.adafruit.com/show-and-tell) to demonstrate an analog binary infinity mirror clock.

> The original plan was to create an analog binary clock, but I had no idea how to do it.  To make it like a regular clock, I would have needed to have 11 hands, which didn’t seem doable.  A loooong while later, I had the inspiration to use [DotStars](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=dotstar) or [NeoPixels](https://www.adafruit.com/category/168) to represent the hands, and the infinity mirror effect would make the LEDs appear to be lines, further adding to the hand effect.

Shawn credited the Ruiz Brothers and their [infinity coasters](https://learn.adafruit.com/infinity-mirror-coaster) for inspiration. _(Ed: I love how sharing ideas can be so creative)_

You can see the details on [Shawn’s Hackaday.io project page](https://hackaday.io/project/169635-analog-binary-infinity-mirror-clock). Super work!

Come by the [Adafruit Show and Tell](https://learn.adafruit.com/show-and-tell) and show your projects every Wednesday 7:30 PM US Eastern time.
