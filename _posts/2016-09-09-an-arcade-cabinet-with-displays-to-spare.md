We’ve all got a pretty good mental image of what an arcade cabinet looks like, so you probably don’t need to be reminded that traditionally they are single-screen affairs. But that idea dates back to when they were built around big and bulky CRT displays. Now that we have modern LCD, LED, and OLED panels, who says you have to follow the old rules?

That’s precisely the sort of out of the box thinking that lead [\[Al Linke\] to build this unique multi-display arcade cabinet](https://www.instructables.com/id/Arcade1Up-Mod-With-LED-Marquee-and-Sub-Displays/). The game itself is still played on a single screen, but several smaller sub-displays are dotted all around the cabinet to indicate various bits of ancillary information. Are they necessary? Hardly. But we can’t deny it’s a clever idea, and we wouldn’t be surprised if we start seeing something similar in other DIY cabinets.

All of the electronics except for the display were stripped out, and replaced with a Dell OptiPlex 9020 computer and high-quality joysticks and buttons. \[Al\] then installed his various displays all over the cabinet, [including a gorgeous LED marquee that we’ve featured previously.](https://hackaday.com/2019/04/04/arcade-with-led-marquee-shows-off-your-game/)

So what do all these little screens do? \[Al\] explains them in the video after the break, but the general idea is that they provide contextual information about the game you currently have loaded up. A two-color OLED display shows the name of the game and what it’s rated, while a seven segment LED display shows the year the game was released. The displays are located both by the controls and where you’d expect the coin slot to be, so whether you’re actively playing or across the room, you can see all the information.

We’re always amazed to see how builders find ways [to make their own personal arcade cabinets stand out](https://hackaday.com/2016/07/29/the-prettiest-darn-arcade-cabinet-youll-see-today/). While it’s an idea that at this point we’ve seen quite a lot of, [no two projects have ever been quite the same](https://hackaday.com/2018/01/14/bartop-arcade-cabinet-build-skips-the-kit/).
