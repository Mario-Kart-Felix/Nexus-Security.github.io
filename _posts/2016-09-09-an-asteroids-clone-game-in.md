Yet another great game written in CircuitPython by [Mr. Coxall’s grade 11 CS class](https://twitter.com/mrcoxall/status/1221811192806674435): Asteroid Breaker. It runs on Adafruit hardware such as the [Adafruit PyBadge](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4200), [PyGamer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4242), and [EdgeBadge](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4400).

> In this project we will be making an old school style video game for the [Adafruit PyBadge](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4200). We will be using [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) and the [stage library](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-stage-game-library) to create a [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) like game. The stage library makes it easy to make classic video games, with helper libraries for sound, sprites and collision detection. The game will also work on other variants of PyBadge hardware, like the [PyGamer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4242) and the [EdgeBadge](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4400). The full completed game code with all the assets can be found [here](https://github.com/MotherTeresaHS/ICS3U-2019-Group0).

> The guide assumes that you have prior coding experience, hopefully in Python. It is designed to use just introductory concepts. No Object Oriented Programming (OOP) are used so that students in particular that have completed their first course in coding and know just variables, if statements, loops and functions will be able to follow along.

See the [video](https://youtu.be/gHuDd-Jwamo) below, [the tutorial](https://ics3u-asteroids-davin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/MotherTeresaHS/ICS3U-2019-Group0) for source code and resource files. Bravo students!
