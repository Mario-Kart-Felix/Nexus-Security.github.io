The project uses a [Circuit Playground Bluefruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333) with a [TFT Gizmo display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4367) attached (no soldering required). Programming is with [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/), just copy the files onto the board like a flash drive and it just works!

Gameplay
--------

Tilt the board to make the ball move. When the ball reach the goal (red cross), a new maze is created randomly.
