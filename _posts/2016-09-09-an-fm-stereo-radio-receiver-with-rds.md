[Dilshan R Jayakody](https://twitter.com/jayakody2000lk) [posts on his blog](http://jayakody2000lk.blogspot.com/2019/09/fm-stereo-radio-receiver-with-rds.html) about testing an RDA5807M FM radio tuner chip with Radio Data Service (RDS):

> At the time of this design, the website of the RDA microelectronics is not accessible from my location. Because of this reason, I download different versions of _RDA5807M_ datasheets from the internet. While going-through those datasheets, I observed that it comes with limited information. Finally, I decided to build this receiver to verify some of those parameters and to review the RDS functionality of the chip.
> 
> At the testing stages, this receiver decodes RDS signals from all the FM station including weak stations. “_RanOne FM_” is the most attractive station name which I captured from this receiver. This station transmits its name in an animated style and its display on the receiver’s LCD without any problems.

The circuit diagram, PCB designs and firmware source code of this receiver are available under MIT and CC-4 licenses at [github.com](https://github.com/dilshan/rda5807m-receiver).
