> From Kara (The Dressed Aesthetic): Fast forward one year. I approached Mr. Dressed with what seemed like an impossible idea – I wanted to create a winter wonderland scene, with rolling hills of snow, bespeckled with Christmas trees and snow falling all around, making me into a human snow globe. But, the kicker was: I wanted Christmas lights on the trees that would _actually light up_, surrounded by glittering illuminated snowflakes.

> From Adam (Mr Dressed): After a bit of internet-searching, I came across a product called [NeoPixels](https://www.adafruit.com/category/168), which are a flexible LED light product sold by the fantastic electronics store [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com). Not only does Adafruit sell the NeoPixels, but they’ve created an entire platform designed around wearable electronics called [FLORA](https://www.adafruit.com/product/659), which turned out to be perfect for this project.

> The FLORA platform is designed to be sewable into clothing, and consists of a number of pieces of electronics.
