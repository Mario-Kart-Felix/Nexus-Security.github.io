> Chihuahuas in space, boys who transform into hummingbirds, cyborgs and legends in the making await you in this collection of Indigenous science fiction and urban fantasy focusing on LGBT and Two-Spirit characters. There’s such a great mix here of heart-breaking and heart-warming and a lot of truth-telling in-between from voices that rarely get heard in the genre. Some of the standout favorites for me were Darcie Little Badger’s “Né łe” and Richard Van Camp’s “Aliens.”

The collection includes stories from indigenous LGBT authors, including:

*   Daniel Heath Justice with “The Boys Who Became the Butterflies,” a new traditional story about the beautiful people that make life worth living and inspire others to live their true selves.
*   Darcie Little Badger with “Né łe” about an astronaut and the in-house vet who face challenges as chihuahuas in outer space run amok.
