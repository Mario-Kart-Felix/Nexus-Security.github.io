[Mohammad Afaneh](https://www.novelbits.io/author/mafaneh/) on [NovelBits provides](https://www.novelbits.io/overview-bluetooth-beacons-part-1/) a great overview of Bluetooth Beacons. Bluetooth beacons are small and wireless battery-powered radio transmitters that use BLE as their transmission protocol. This mini-radio transmission device can be ‘discovered’ and seen by all BLE scanners within a certain radius. The Bluetooth beacon, however, cannot ‘see’ anyone back.

> Bluetooth beacons allow businesses to automate certain processes and enhance experience-based actions and interactions. Bluetooth beacons are part of the Internet of Things (IoT), which is the connection between different devices and machines to collect and transfer data without human-to-human or human-to-computer relationships.
> 
> Bluetooth beacons work by transmitting packets of data that are picked up by a compatible receiving device via radio waves. These packets of data are either self-contained or are triggers to events on the receiving device such as push notifications, app actions, and prompts.
