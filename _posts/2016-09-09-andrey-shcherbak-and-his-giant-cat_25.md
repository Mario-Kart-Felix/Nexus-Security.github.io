> The Russian artist lives in Rostov-on-Don and works remotely from home as a creative director for an advertising agency in Moscow. He has two cats, Pif and Panya, both adopted, and a Labrador named Rooney ‚Äì all of them get along very well. The idea for his giant cat project ‚Äúcame about by chance‚Äù. Shcherbak was looking through a photo album and one picture he‚Äôd taken in a forest on a corporate retreat caught his eye. ‚ÄúI liked it, so I took another photo with the intention of placing a cat in it. I decided to create an Instagram account full of pictures of only me and cats because that‚Äôs not very different from the reality I live in. I lead a rather isolated way of life.‚Äù And that‚Äôs how we got this viral furry project, now we love it even more, so in case you still didn‚Äôt, be sure to visit Shcherbak‚Äôs [Instagram Page](https://www.instagram.com/odnoboko/?hl=en).
