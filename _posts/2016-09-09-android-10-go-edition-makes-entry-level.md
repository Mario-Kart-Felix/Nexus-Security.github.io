Android 10 officially started rolling out a mere three weeks ago and while it’s slowly but steadily making its way to more (mostly, flagship) smartphones, Google has announced today Android 10 (Go Edition) for entry-level smartphones. It succeeds Android 9 Pie Go Edition from last year, bringing in tow faster app load times and enhanced security.  

If you have forgotten about Android Go, well, here’s a quick refresher. It’s a lightweight version of Android that’s optimized to run on low-end phones with 1.5GB of RAM or less. Android 10 Go Edition is the newest update to this platform and in [Google’s own words](https://blog.google/products/android/more-improvements-android-entry-level-phones/), _“With Android 10 (Go edition), we’ve made Android faster and more secure.”_ The most significant upgrade has to be speed and reliability.  

Google states that **app launch times on Android 10 Go Edition have improved 10-fold** as compared to [Android 9 (Go Edition)](https://beebom.com/faster-and-leaner-android-9-pie-go-edition-is-coming-later-this-fall/). It is now more memory-efficient and you would be able to notice a slight difference while multi-tasking. Another important and necessary upgrade comes in the form of encryption.  

The official press release states that Google is utilizing a new form of encryption called Adiantum (not to be confused with Adamantium and Wolverine), designed specially for entry-level phones. It will provide cheap phones with the **same level of security as a high-end Android phone**, but utilize fewer resources than before.

Android 10 Go Edition, it goes without saying, will be jam-packed with Google’s Go app portfolio. The company has been rolling out new features for its Go apps, polishing the experience over the past year. You’ll have [Gallery Go](https://beebom.com/gallery-go-app-launched/) (less than 10MB in size), [Files Go](https://beebom.com/google-files-go-introduces-advanced-browsing-native-media-playback-and-more/) (with file sharing), Google Go (with AI text narration), [YouTube Go](https://beebom.com/youtube-lightweight-app-youtube-go-expands-130-countries/), Maps Go and many other Go-optimized apps from third-party developers on board.  

The timely release of Android 10 Go Edition reaffirms Google’s commitment to lower-end phones, which has gotten a new lease of life with this stripped-down lightweight Android platform. Google boasts that _“over 500 manufacturers have launched more than 1,600 Android (Go edition) devices”_ in the past year, with $27 being the most affordable price tag.  

The figures say a lot about the smartphone market, which is still witnessing an influx of first-time users. Google says that Android 10 Go Edition-backed phones will launch later this fall, so stay tuned for more updates. Ready for Redmi Go 2?
