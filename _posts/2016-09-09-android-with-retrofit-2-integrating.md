Develop android client applications to effectively communicate/integrate with JSON Restful APIs using Retrofit  
**What Will I Learn?**  

*   Ability to create Android applications which can communicate with JSON RESTful APIs/Web Services.

**Requirements**  

*   Android Studio

**Description**  
As Android developers we always need to build apps which communicate with back end   Restful APIs.Retrofit is the best technology available today for that task.  
  
” Restrofit ” is a must have skill if you want to become a professional Android Developer.  
  
Unlike other older methodologies, Retrofit take care of speed, security,multi-threading and communication protocols.You only have to think about queries.  
  
This course is a step by step guide to anyone who is passionate and determined to master Android Network Communicatins .  
  
You can learn Retrofit by self studying( by following blogs,youtube and stackoverflow). I can remember when I was doing so It took more than 3 weeks and a lot of effort to master Retrofit.There are some parts you can never understand clearly until you apply that to a real world project (and get an error to fix).  
  
Here, I have solved that problem for you.  
  
This course created as a One Day Workshop. If you follow this course today. You can start working with Retrofit from tomorrow.  
  
Anyway you have a life time access to this course. You can follow it at any speed you like. And I am always available to support you(one to one) .  
  
I have combined over 10 years of my software engineering working experience and my passion to teach to create this very easy to understand step by step learning experience for you.  
  
This course does not cover each and every function available with Retrofit, but this course will cover more than enough to you to start working with Retrofit.  
  
Just give it a try, you know  this course comes with a 30 day money back guarantee. If you unsatisfied, we will give your money back. You have no risk at all.  
**Note:**  
We will use Android Studio as the IDE for this course.You may need to download and install it before start the course(If you haven’t installed it yet). During the course to demonstrate different usages of retrofit, we will use TMDB free online REST API  . You may need to provide an email address to get a free API key from them.  
**Who is the target audience?**  

*   Beginner(at least with 2 months of Android experience) and Intermediate level Android Developers
