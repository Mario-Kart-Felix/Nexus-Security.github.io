We wrote a library to play animated GIFs on ‘arcada’ compatible boards in Arduino. The CLUE has a 240×240 display and two buttons, so its a perfect lil GIF player. [Check out the guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/pyportal-animated-gif-display) for a UF2 you can drag n drop onto your CLUE – [YouTube](https://youtu.be/lwcfP4m-ltE).
