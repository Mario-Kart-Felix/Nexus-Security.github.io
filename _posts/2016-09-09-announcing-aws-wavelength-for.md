AWS Wavelength brings AWS services to the edge of the 5G network, minimizing the network hops and latency to connect to an application from a 5G device. Wavelength delivers a consistent developer experience across multiple 5G networks around the world, allowing you to build the next generation of ultra-low latency applications using familiar AWS services, APIs, and tools. To deploy your application to the 5G edge, simply extend your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to a Wavelength Zone and then create AWS resources like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances and Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volumes.

AWS is partnering with leading telecommunications companies around the world, including Verizon, Vodafone, SK Telecom, and KDDI, to launch Wavelength across North America, Europe, Japan, and South Korea in 2020.
