> In April 2020, the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope will celebrate 30 years since its launch. ESA/Hubble has produced a commemorative calendar of the telescope’s Hidden Gems that is now available for everyone to use and enjoy.

> In September 2019, ESA/Hubble [announced](https://www.spacetelescope.org/announcements/ann1909/) a special social media initiative to celebrate three decades of success in scientific discoveries, engineering accomplishments and cultural impact with the NASA/ESA Hubble Telescope. The campaign showcased 30 hidden gems from the ESA/Hubble image archive that are not as well known as the Top 100 Images, but are also truly beautiful. From September to November 2019, 30 special #Hubble30 images were shared on ESA/Hubble’s Facebook and Instagram accounts. The 12 images that received the most likes counted from both platforms were compiled to produce a special 30th Anniversary Calendar for 2020. The special 30th anniversary calendar can now be accessed electronically for anyone to print, share and enjoy.
