Ant Colony Optimization visualization for the Travelling Salesman Problem
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This small experiment stands as a way for visualizing the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) solution, using the Ant Colony Optimization strategy.

The TSP can be stated as follow: _given a list of nodes, find the shortest route that visits each city only once and returns to the origin city._  
More info on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)

The ACO algorithm is used to solve the problem more efficiently than a brute-force approach, and is based on nature inspired behaviours of ants letting pheromones on their way.  
This demo is based on the section 5.3 from the book Clever Algorithms. You can read more about it [here](https://www.cleveralgorithms.com/nature-inspired/swarm/ant_colony_system.html)
