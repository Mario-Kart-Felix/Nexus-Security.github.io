![](https://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-2019.jpg) Apple launched the 1st generation AirPods back in 2016 and earlier this year, the company introduced new AirPods with H1 chip and optional wireless charging case. Now, Apple is all set to launch new AirPods Pro with revamped design and noise-cancelling feature by end of this month, according to reports. The new 'AirPods Pro' will adopt a revamped in-ear design, come with the noise-cancelling feature and will be positioned at a higher level compared to old AirPods. The report also claims that Apple has chosen the 'Pro' name for the new AirPods in order to differentiate the new model with old AirPods with H1 chip. Another report suggests that the AirPods supplier Inventec is said to be coordinating with Lixun, a Chinese manufacturer to undertake new orders of the AirPods Pro. Furthermore, the AirPods Pro will also sport a new metal design for increased heat dissipation, suggests the report. Regarding the pricing, Apple AirPods Pro is said to cost US$260 (Rs. 18,480 approx.) and is said to launch by end of this month. We should know more information in the coming days. Source 1, 2 | Via
