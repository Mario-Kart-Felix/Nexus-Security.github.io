Amazon on Wednesday took the wraps off of a whole host of gadgets, including the Echo Buds wireless in-ear earbuds that the company believes will be able to compete on equal terms with the product that has become the yardstick in the segment, the Apple AirPods. Priced at $129.99, the Echo Buds is currently available for [pre-order on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Buds/dp/B07F6VM1S3) and will start shipping from September 30th.  

The Amazon Echo Buds are compatible with Alexa and come with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) technology from Bose. They also sport a built-in microphone that will enable users to control music playback through Alexa voice commands. The buds also work with the Alexa app to stream music, play Audible audiobooks, make calls, or get directions, all through voice commands.  

Users will also be able to hold the side of the bud to activate the phone’s default voice assistant, whether it’s Siri of Google Assistant. Like AirPods, music will automatically pause when either of the buds are taken out of the ear. According to Amazon, the Echo Buds will offer around five hours of music playback on a single charge. They also come with a battery case that adds an additional 15-hours of battery life and, can be charged via a standard USB cable.  

As mentioned already, the device comes with Bose’s active noise cancellation technology that can be turned on and off on-demand by double-tapping on either of the buds. They also come with three ear tip sizes that offer customizable fit for better sound as well as comfortable in-ear seal for immersive listening.
