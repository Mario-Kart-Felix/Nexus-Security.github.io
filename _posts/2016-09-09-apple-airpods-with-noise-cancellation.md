Ever since the launch of the first generation Apple AirPods, there have always been rumors regarding a variant supporting active noise cancellation. If you have ever used AirPods, you must be aware of the need for noise cancellation since it lets in a lot of ambient noise. Well, according to a new [report from 9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/02/new-in-ear-airpods-with-noise-cancelling-found-in-ios-13-2-beta/), an early official look at the design of these new AirPods has been spotted on iOS 13.2 beta along with support for the much-awaited noise cancellation. ![](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/in-ear-airpods.jpg)

From the looks of it, the good-old ear tips might be making a comeback. If this turns out to be true in the final design of AirPods, a lot of accidental falls can be avoided since the earbuds will fit firmly and will be usable for a wider audience rather than the “one-size-fits-all” approach seen in the current AirPods.  

The report also suggests that these upcoming earbuds have a feature named **“focus mode”** that will let users toggle noise cancellation. The model number of AirPods has been noted to be B298.  

The icon also complies with the [leaked prototypes](http://www.slashleaks.com/l/alleged-airpods-3-prototype-surfaces) of the upcoming AirPods. Take a look at the leaked prototype below in case you’ve missed it. It looks similar, doesn’t it?

There is a solid chance for these new AirPods to be announced at a special event later this month. We will have to witness if Apple takes this leap forward with its AirPods, especially since there are a lot of [alternative options](https://beebom.com/airpods-alternatives/) in the market now to consider.
