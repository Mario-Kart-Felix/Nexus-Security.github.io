Apple’s subscription-based gaming service, Arcade, is adding an annual subscription option for Rs. 999 per year in India. The new plan will be in addition to the existing Rs. 99 monthly subscription option that the company has offered [since the service was launched](https://beebom.com/apple-arcade-available-macos-catalina-gold-master/) in India earlier this year. The price is already significantly lower than the $4.99 (around Rs 350) that US subscribers are playing to access the service, and the new long-term plan will only make it more lucrative for users in the country.  

Customers who have already subscribed to the monthly [Apple Arcade](https://beebom.com/apple-arcade-vs-google-play-pass/) plan can switch to the annual one by navigating to the Subscriptions menu in the App Store.

Most of the games also support PS4 and Xbox One controllers that can be [paired with iPhones](https://beebom.com/connect-ps4-controller-iphone/) for an enhanced gaming experience.  

One of the newest titles on the platform is a sports game franchise called ‘[Ultimate Rivals](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/12/apple-launches-new-ultimate-rivals-sports-game-franchise-on-apple-arcade/)‘ that brings together athletes across ice-hockey, basketball, American football, baseball and soccer into a single officially-licensed video game – a first in sports and gaming.
