Apple’s game subscription service, [Apple Arcade](https://beebom.com/apple-arcade-vs-google-play-pass/) has been available to iPhone users with iOS 13 for a while now, and finally, the company is bringing the service to Mac users as well, with the latest [macOS Catalina](https://beebom.com/macos-catalina-features/) Gold Master candidate that was released on October 3.  

With Apple Arcade, the Cupertino giant is trying to make high-quality games available to people as a package deal for a low price of **$4.99 per month**, where users will be able to download any number of games from the Apple Arcade catalog without any extra charges. What’s more, these games come without any ads, in-app purchases, or loot-boxes.  

Apple Arcade games will be **available across macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS**, with users’ progress synced with iCloud so they can pick up their games on their platform of choice without sacrificing their progress.  

For people running macOS Catalina GM, **Apple Arcade is now available to access from the Mac App Store**, and users can even **pair Xbox and PS4 controllers** to their devices for a better gaming experience, especially on titles like Oceanhorn 2.  

macOS Catalina is expected to roll out pretty soon, with some reports having suggested an October 4 release date for the stable version of Catalina, but obviously, that didn’t happen. Still, with the Gold Master candidate having been rolled out by Apple, a stable release shouldn’t be too far off.  

So, have you tried Apple Arcade yet? I’m just getting started with the service on my iPhone XR, and so far, I like it. Share your thoughts in the comments down below.
