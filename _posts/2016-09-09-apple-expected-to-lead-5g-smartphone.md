Though Apple has not yet come out with a [5G iPhone](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/5g-iphone/), the company is expected to lead the 5G smartphone market in 2020, according to a new report today from analytics firm [Strategy Analytics](https://news.strategyanalytics.com/press-release/devices/strategy-analytics-apple-capture-top-spot-5g-smartphones-2020).  
  
  
  
  
  
Apple is expected to capture a dominant share of the emerging 5G market in 2020, following the launch of 5G iPhones. Strategy Analytics believes that Apple simply needs to match its current upgrade rates to dominate the 5G market after September 2020.

> "It may seem counterintuitive that Apple, which currently has no 5G phones in its portfolio will be able to pass current 5G market leaders Samsung and Huawei," comments Ken Hyers, Director at Strategy Analytics. "But with three new 5G models coming next year, Apple merely needs to match its current upgrade rates for newly introduced iPhone models to take the lead next year."

> "Currently Samsung is the undisputed market leader in 5G smartphones," comments Ville-Petteri Ukonaho, Associate Director at Strategy Analytics. "But with the two largest 5G markets in 2020, China and the USA, dominated by Huawei and Apple respectively, these two vendors are set to lead in 5G next year."

All of the iPhones coming in 2020 are expected to [include 5G technology](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/28/all-2020-iphones-5g-support/), according to well-respected Apple analyst [Ming-Chi Kuo](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ming-chi-kuo/). Kuo originally believed that only the two higher-end iPhones coming in 2020 would support 5G, but later revised his prediction.  
  
  
  
  
  
Apple will offer 5G speeds for all of its smartphones in order to better compete with lower-cost Android smartphones that support 5G. We're expecting a total of three iPhones in 2020, including a 5.4-inch model, a 6.7-inch model, and a 6.1-inch model.  
  
  
  
  
  
The 5.4 and 6.7-inch iPhones are expected to be higher-end devices similar to the [iPhone 11 Pro](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11-pro/) and Pro Max, while the 6.1-inch iPhone will feature a lower price tag much like the [iPhone 11](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11/).  
  
  
  
  
  
Though Apple is expected to do well in the 5G smartphone market in 2020, Strategy Analytics ultimately believes that Samsung will be the 5G leader longterm due to its "dominance of the overall smartphone market" and broader range of price points.  
  
  
  
  
  
Huawei's success, meanwhile, is limited by the US trade ban, but it is still expected to be the dominant 5G smartphone provider in China.
