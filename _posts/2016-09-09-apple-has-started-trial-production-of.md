In spite of no official word from Apple, a [whole bunch of leaks](https://beebom.com/iphone-se-2-price-specs/) over the past several months have all but confirmed the company’s plans to launch at least one – maybe even two – successors to the iPhone SE this year. Now, a new report out of China suggests that the company may have already started trial production of its next-gen affordable smartphones, rumored to be marketed as the iPhone 9.  

According to Chinese tech blog, _MyDrivers_, the report comes from unnamed ‘industry sources’ in China, who further claimed that mass production of the device will start in mid-February before it is [officially announced in March](https://beebom.com/apple-iphone-se-2-launch-date-expected-march/). The company is also reportedly expecting total shipments for the phone to exceed 30 million units globally.  

The report also reiterates that the device will be **named iPhone 9 instead of iPhone SE 2** and, would be priced under 3,000 yuan (around Rs. 30,000) in China. As pointed out by _GizmoChina_, that would be in line with the pricing of the original iPhone SE, which was priced at $399 in the US, although, it had a significantly higher price-tag in India.  

Apple has long been rumored to launch its [successor to the iPhone SE](https://beebom.com/iphone-se-2-ipad-pro-launch-2020/) in early 2020, but recent reports have also suggested that Apple might launch a [grand total of six iPhones](https://beebom.com/apple-launch-6-iphones-2020-prices/) this year, including not one, but two low-cost iPhone SE successors that are [said to come with an iPhone 8-like form-factor](https://beebom.com/iphone-se2-coming-2020-ming-chi-kuo/), but with the latest hardware under-the-hood, including the company’s latest A13 Bionic processor, alongside 3GB of LPDDR4X RAM and up to 128GB of storage, although, it’s unlikely to have 3D Touch.
