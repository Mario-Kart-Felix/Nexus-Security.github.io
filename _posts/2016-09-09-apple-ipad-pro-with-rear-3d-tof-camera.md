![](https://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Apple-iPad-Pro-10.5_fonearena-05.jpg) Earlier this week, there was a report regarding iPhone SE 2 with iPhone 8-like design and A13 chip launching in Q1 2020. On similar lines, now a new report suggests that Apple is said to launch a new iPad Pro with ToF camera in the first half of 2020 and new MacBook models with the Scissor keyboard in the second half of 2020. According to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the new iPad Pro will sport a rear 3D ToF (time-of-flight camera) and this is the first time there is specific information regarding a 3D ToF sensing camera system as previous reports only suggested that 2020 iPad Pro and iPhones will come with ToF camera. The report also suggests that the 2020 MacBook models will come with the Scissor mechanism instead of the Butterfly mechanism. The adoption of the Scissor mechanism is said to result in increased keyboard durability as the Butterfly mechanism had issues earlier which Apple acknowledged too. Apple is expected to launch the new iPad Pro in Q1 2020 and new MacBook models in Q2 2020. We should know more information in the coming months. Source
