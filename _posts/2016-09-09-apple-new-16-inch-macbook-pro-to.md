Apple's upcoming 16-inch [MacBook Pro](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/) is set to replace the current 15-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌, which is priced starting at $2,399, according to a new report from _[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-12/apple-to-update-macbook-pro-with-new-keyboard-after-complaints)_.  
  
  
  
  
  
The new 16-inch machine, which will be the largest laptop Apple has offered for sale since the 17-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ was discontinued, will "cost about the same" as the current 15-inch model.

Prior reports suggested the 16-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ would be sold alongside the 15-inch model as a higher-end, more expensive option, but it sounds like it won't be quite as pricey as first expected.  
  
  
  
  
  
The new ‌MacBook Pro‌ is said to feature a revamped keyboard that's designed to be "more reliable," and previous rumors have indicated that it will abandon the butterfly switch mechanism Apple has been using for a new scissor switch mechanism.  
  
  
  
  
  
The display of the upcoming machine will be brighter, and _Bloomberg_ suggests it will appeal to video and photo editors, gamers, and software developers.  
  
  
  
  
  
As for launch timing, _Bloomberg_ believes that the new ‌MacBook Pro‌ will come out as soon as Wednesday, with the [Mac Pro](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/) to then follow at some point in December.  
  
  
  
  
  
Apple this week has been holding [private press briefings](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/12/16-inch-macbook-pro-expected-by-tomorrow/) at its luxury loft mansion in New York City, likely providing media sites with review units for first impressions. Apple will announce the new 16-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ via press release, as there are no more Apple events expected this year.
