After initially [dragging its feet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/china-has-apple-by-the-iphones/) in approving HKlive.map into its app store, the iPhone maker has abruptly reversed course and removed it.

HKmap.live [tweeted](https://twitter.com/hkmaplive/status/1182136794646757377) on Thursday afternoon that its app had been pulled by Apple.

"We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps. We have learned that your app has been used in ways that endanger law enforcement and residents in Hong Kong," HKmap.live said.

Further [tweets](https://twitter.com/KongTsungGan/status/1182146601608863745) claimed Apple said it had many complaints about the app in Hong Kong, which it reportedly said was used to ambush police.

The app is still available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.hkmap.app&hl=en), and thankfully it is viewable to all and sundry through its [web site](https://hkmap.live/).

Apple now joins the ranks of Blizzard and the National Basketball Association (NBA) in bowing down to Beijing's demands this week.

On Tuesday, Blizzard took back its [prize money and suspended Heartstone player](https://www.cnet.com/news/blizzard-pulls-blitzchung-from-hearthstone-esports-tournament-over-support-for-hong-kong-protests/) Chung "Blitzchung" Ng Wai after he expressed support for Hong Kong.

Blizzard is part-owned by Chinese giant Tencent.

Since the weekend, the NBA has found itself in hot water with China after the general manager of the Houston Rockets [tweeted his support](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/daryl-morey-china-tweet-economic-impact-nba-adam-silver-cctv-cancels-preseason-games-today-2019-10-08/) for the Hong Kong protests.

In retaliation, the league's preseason games [will not be shown](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/daryl-morey-china-tweet-economic-impact-nba-adam-silver-cctv-cancels-preseason-games-today-2019-10-08/)Â in the Middle Kingdom.

On Tuesday night, a Philadelphia 76ers fan was [removed after showing support](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/76ers-fan-hong-kong-protest-game-ejection-china-nba-philadelphia/) for Hong Kong.

Apple makes [around $3 billion in revenue](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-beats-q3-estimates-with-record-services-revenue/) from China each month.
