Apple is [removing all vaping-related apps from the App Store](https://www.axios.com/exclusive-apple-to-remove-vaping-apps-from-store-8669fd94-e92a-4ce4-a9e2-ce5afa598b67.html) today, according to _Axios_, shortly after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [reported 2,172 lung injury cases linked to e-cigarette or vape products](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/vaping/vaping-illness-cases-rise-again-2-172-cdc-says-n1082341).

In a statement issued to _Axios_, Apple said it agrees with expert opinions that vaping is a "public health crisis" and a "youth epidemic":

> We take great care to curate the App Store as a trusted place for customers, particularly youth, to download apps. We're constantly evaluating apps, and consulting the latest evidence, to determine risks to users' health and well-being.  
>   
>   
>   
>   
>   
> Recently, experts ranging from the CDC to the American Heart Association have attributed a variety of lung injuries and fatalities to e-cigarette and vaping products, going so far as to call the spread of these devices a public health crisis and a youth epidemic.  
>   
>   
>   
>   
>   
> We agree, and we've updated our App Store Review Guidelines to reflect that apps encouraging or facilitating the use of these products are not permitted. As of today, these apps are no longer available to download.

Apple had already took a step in this direction in June when it updated its [App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/) to indicate that apps encouraging consumption of vape products are not permitted on the App Store.  
  
  
  
  
  
Vaping-related apps already installed on iOS devices will continue to function.
