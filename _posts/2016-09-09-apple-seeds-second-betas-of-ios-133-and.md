Apple today seeded the second betas of upcoming iOS and [iPadOS](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados/) 13.3 updates to developers, one week after [seeding the first beta](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/05/apple-seeds-ios-13-3-beta-1-to-developers/) and two weeks after the [release of iOS 13.2](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/28/apple-releases-ios-13-2/) with new emoji, [Siri](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/) privacy controls, Deep Fusion, and more.  
  
  
  
  
  
iOS and ‌‌‌iPadOS‌‌‌ 13.3 can be downloaded through the Apple Developer Center or over the air after the proper developer profile has been installed.

iOS 13.3 introduces [Communication Limits](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/05/ios-13-3-communication-limits/) for Screen Time, a feature that Apple promised would be coming in an [iOS 13](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-13/) update. Communication Limits allow parents to control who their children are able to contact both during downtime and during Screen Time.  
  
  
  
  
  
Communication Limits include FaceTime, Phone, and Messages, along with [iCloud](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/icloud/) contacts. Calls to emergency numbers are always allowed and will turn off communication limits for 24 hours when placed.  
  
  
  
  
  
The iOS 13.3 update also appears to [address a multitasking issue](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/05/ios-13-3-multitasking-bug-fix/) where iOS 13.2 users were seeing poor RAM management that caused apps like YouTube and Safari to reload more frequently than normal.  
  
  
  
  
  
After installing iOS 13.3, affected users are now seeing fewer refreshes when accessing these apps, doing another task, and then opening them again.  
  
  
  
  
  
In the Keyboards section of the Settings app (under General), there's a new toggle that prevents Animoji and Memoji stickers from being displayed as an option on the Emoji Keyboard, and when editing a video, there's an option to save the edited version as a new clip rather than saving over the original.  
  
  
  
  
  
Apple has also tweaked the [Apple Watch](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/) app icon, changing the color of the Digital Crown from black to gray.
