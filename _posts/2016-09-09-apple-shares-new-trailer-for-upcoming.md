Apple this evening shared a new trailer for its upcoming [Apple TV](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/)\+ show "Servant," which is set to come out in just over two weeks.  
  
  
  
  
  
This particular clip shows a doll maker creating Jericho, the lifelike fake baby that plays a starring role in the show.  
  
  
  
  
  

  
  
  
"Servant" is a thriller produced and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, known for movies like "Signs," "Glass," "Split," and more. The movie follows a Philadelphia couple who hire a nanny to look after their "child" following a tragedy.  
  
  
  
  
  
Based on the trailers that have been shown so far, including the newest trailer, a couple loses a child and then adopts Jericho, a rather real-looking fake baby. The nanny that's hired to look after Jericho turns out to be unusual herself, leading to a series of strange events.  
  
  
  
  
  

  
  
  
"Servant" will be the first major new series to come to ‌Apple TV‌+ following its November 1 launch, with the show set to debut on Thursday, November 28. "Servant" is a shorter form show that will feature 10 30 minute episodes.
