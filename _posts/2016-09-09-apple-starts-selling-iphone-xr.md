With this, Apple is expanding its portfolio of smartphones under the ‘Made in India’ scheme. As mentioned on the box, the phone is assembled in Chennai by Taipei-based contract manufacturer Foxconn. Apple is already assembling iPhone 6s, iPhone SE and iPhone 7 models in India by Winstron in Bengaluru. The iPhone XR assembling is said to have started back in July. A recent report said that iPhone XS devices will also be assembled in India by Foxconn soon after approvals. Assembling iPhones locally in India will help the company save on high taxes levied on the import of fully-built devices. Technology analysts say that by assembling in India, Apple could also use India as its export hub to soften the impact of the trade war between the United States and China. The iPhone XR got a price cut in India last month, and currently starts at Rs. 49,900 (MRP) down from the launch price of Rs. 76,900 (MRP), however the MOP is much cheaper since the phone is available for Rs. 44,900 from Amazon.in .
