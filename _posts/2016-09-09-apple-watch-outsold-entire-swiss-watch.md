The Apple Watch outsold the entire Swiss watch industry by a huge margin in 2019. Apple Watch shipped around 31 million units worldwide in 2019, compared with 21 million for all Swiss watch brands combined.  

According to [Strategy Analytics](https://www.strategyanalytics.com/strategy-analytics/blogs/wearables/2020/02/05/apple-watch-outsells-entire-swiss-watch-industry-in-2019), a global, independent research and consulting firm, the traditional Swiss watchmakers, like Swatch and Tissot, are losing the smartwatch wars. Apple Watch is delivering a better product through deeper retail channels and appealing to younger consumers who increasingly want digital wristwear.  

_“We estimate Apple Watch shipped 30.7 million units worldwide in 2019, growing a healthy 36 percent from 22.5 million in 2018. A blend of attractive design, user-friendly tech, and sticky apps makes the Apple Watch wildly popular in North America, Western Europe, and Asia”_, Steven Waltzer, Senior Analyst at Strategy Analytics, said in a statement.
