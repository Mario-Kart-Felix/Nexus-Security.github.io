> In the patent Apple explains that touchscreen devices can be seen as “cumbersome, inconvenient, or inefficient for certain tasks and applications,” [reports The Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/10154037/apple-invents-smart-ring/). The company says the Apple Ring could be a more efficient way to control iPhone or iPad from a distance because holding these devices for too long could fatigue some users.
> 
> Apple also underlines the potential safety features of the ring. It says that the light emitted from some touchscreen devices such as a smartphone, could be “inappropriate in certain social environments or even dangerous if it gives away the position of a threatened user.” Therefore, the company says that in a dangerous situation the smart ring could be a safer and more discreet way for people to get help.
