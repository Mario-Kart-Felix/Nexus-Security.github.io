Apple just announced a [new 16-inch version of its MacBook Pro](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962380/apples-16-inch-macbook-pro-keyboard-screen-speakers-processor) earlier this morning, with a revamped "Magic" keyboard, improved speakers, and other new features you can see in Dieter Bohn's hands-on video above. Surprisingly, several configurations of this machine are already discounted by up to $350 off their usual prices. The total dollar amount that you'll get off depends on the model you're after, but this is a good deal if you're thinking of picking one up.

You'll be able to find these discounts from [Expercom](https://fave.co/2q0F03r), an online retailer that is an Apple Premier Partner, and it offers a few tweak-friendly configurations, in case you want to customize the specs, as well as the standard preset models. You'll need to make any necessary spec adjustments yourself on Expercom's site, but here's the pricing breakdown, as was first noted by [_9to5Toys_](https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/13/apple-16-inch-macbook-pro-deal/):

These prices can't be beat right now, and no offer code is necessary to reap the savings. It's worth noting that the shipping and delivery windows differ for most models, but set your expectations for one or two weeks before delivery. People who order it through Apple might get their new MacBook Pro first, but you will have saved a good amount of money for your wait.
