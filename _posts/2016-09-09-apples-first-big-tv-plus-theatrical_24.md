Apple is delaying the theatrical release of its upcoming feature film _The Banker_ following sexual misconduct allegations leveled about Bernard Garrett Jr., the son of the character depicted by Anthony Mackie in the film.

  

“We purchased _The Banker_ earlier this year as we were moved by the film’s entertaining and educational story about social change and financial literacy,” an Apple representative said in a statement to _The Verge,_ echoing what the company previously said. “Last week some concerns surrounding the film were brought to our attention. We, along with the filmmakers, need some time to look into these matters and determine the best next steps. In light of this, we are no longer premiering _The Banke_r at AFI Fest.”

  

The theatrical release is delayed at this time, with no revised release date available, the company confirmed to _The Verge_. The film was originally due to have its premiere on November 21st, on the closing night of AFI Fest in Hollywood, ahead of its theatrical release on December 6th.

With a cast that includes Mackie, Samuel L. Jackson, Nicholas Hoult, and Nia Long, _The Banker_ is one of the highest profile films acquired by Apple for its streaming service. The movie also marked Apple’s first major foray into theatrical releases, with early reports suggesting it could make Apple an Oscar contender. _The Banker_ was originally due to arrive on the company’s Apple TV Plus streaming service early next year, but Apple hasn’t provided any comment on whether that has changed following the controversy.

  

Garrett Jr. has been involved with promoting the film, and acted as a consultant during its production, [_Deadline_ previously reported](https://deadline.com/2019/11/apple-delaying-theatrical-release-of-the-banker-1202793242/). _The Banker_ is one of three films Apple was set to release in 2019 alongside _The Elephant Queen_ and _Hala._
