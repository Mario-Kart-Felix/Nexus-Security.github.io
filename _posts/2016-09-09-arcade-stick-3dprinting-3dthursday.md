> Hi all!  
> I felt the urge to design an arcade stick case myself because I always wanted to make one but despite serveral research on different websites i’ve never been able to find one that I really liked.  
> After a couple of weeks of testing I’m happy with it, it’s pretty large and comfortable, the printed parts are solid, and if you glue a couple of rocks in it to make it heavier it’s way better.  
> I’m having only one issue with this design, right now the bottom of the case must be glued to the top side because the bottom part is pretty large and using only screws to attach it to the top side will make it bend. I’ve not been able to sketch any screw housing on the middle section.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
