Welcome to BlueMaxima's Flashpoint, the webgame preservation project.

Internet history is important, and content made on platforms such as Adobe Flash are a significant portion of that culture doomed to obscurity. This project is dedicated to preserving as many games and animations from these platforms as possible, so that they aren't lost to time. Since early 2018, Flashpoint has saved more than 38,000 games and 2,400 animations running on 13 different platforms.
