> It’s one thing to be able to transcribe music from a flute, and it’s another to be able to make a flute play pre-written music. The latter is what \[Abhilash Patel\] decided to pursue in the [flute player machine](https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Based-Flute-Player-Machine/), an Arduino-based project that uses an air flow mechanism and PVC pipes to control the notes produced by a makeshift flute. It’s currently able to play 17 notes, just over two octaves starting from the lowest frequency of E.
> 
> In order to play songs, the tones have to either be directly coded and uploaded to the Arduino, composed with a random note generator, or detected from a microphone. While a real flute can be used for the machine, \[Patel\] uses a PVC flute, constructed with some knowledge of flute playing.
