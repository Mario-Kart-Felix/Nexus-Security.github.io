> This turntable is a new and improved version of my hand cranked version (Can be found here: [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3723618](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3723618)). A lot of people suggested to me I should put a stepper motor onto it to get some very nice cinematic shots. This is exactly what I did.
> 
> I gave it a bit more functionality than just a regular cinematic turntable. I added the possibility to use the turntable as a rig to capture photos 360 degrees around an object.
> 
> The photos are being taken by a smartphone connected to a Bluetooth remote located inside the turntable. I just used the most straight forward, obvious and simple solution to capture these photos, which was to use a servo to press a button on a Bluetooth remote. I went for this solution due to the fact that Apple products tend to not like the HC-05 and HC-06 Bluetooth modules and refuse to connect to them. Iâ€™m sure a cleaner and more durable solution is to use these HC-05 or HC-06 modules and connect them to an android device.
