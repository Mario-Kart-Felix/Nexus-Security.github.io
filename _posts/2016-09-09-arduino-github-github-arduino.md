GitHub has these great customer stories, [here’s one about Arduino](https://github.com/customer-stories/arduino) –

At some point it became a company and we’re still working that way.” All internal employees have access to repositories, and “our policies are pretty open. We highly encourage everyone to take a look at what’s going on.”
