With little more than an Arduino, an OLED display, and some buttons, it’s easy to build your own faux-retro game system. There’s even a growing library of titles out there that target this specific combination of hardware, thanks in no small part to the Arduboy project. But unless you’re content to play _Circuit Dude_ on a breadboard, at some point you’ll probably want to wrap the build up in a more convenient form.

Like many that came before it, the OLED handheld created by \[Alex Zidros\] takes inspiration from a Nintendo product; but it’s not the Game Boy. Instead, [his design is based on a 3D printed grip for the Switch Joy-Cons](https://github.com/aziddy/Mini-OLED-Retro-Handheld) that he found on Thingiverse. After tacking on a holder for the PCB, he had the makings of a rather unique system.

Not because we think a game system with an asymmetrical layout is a particularly sound design decision, but because it gives the whole build a rather cyberpunk feel. When combined with the exposed electronics, the whole system looks like it could have been cobbled together from a futuristic dumpster. Which is high praise, as far as we’re concerned.

Opposite the display is a LiPo pouch battery that \[Alex\] says was liberated from a portable speaker, and down below is an Adafruit Feather 328P. There are two tactile switches mounted to the front of the Feather, and in something of a departure from these sort of builds, there are two more on the shoulders of the 3D printed case. Everything is held together with nothing more exotic than a scrap of perfboard, making it easy for anyone who might want to build their own version.

If you prefer your Arduino and OLED gaming to come in a slightly more familiar form factor, [the build that was done inside of a Dreamcast Visual Memory Unit (VMU)](https://hackaday.com/2019/07/15/aruboy-in-a-dreamcast-vmu/) has always been a favorite around these parts.
