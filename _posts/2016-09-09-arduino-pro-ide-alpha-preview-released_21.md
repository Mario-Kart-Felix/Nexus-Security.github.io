The [Arduino Pro IDE (alpha preview) was released](https://blog.arduino.cc/2019/10/18/arduino-pro-ide-alpha-preview-with-advanced-features/) at Maker Faire Rome over the weekend and on the [Arduino developer list](https://groups.google.com/a/arduino.cc/forum/#!topic/developers/VlznDFDoaCE) Massimo, the co-founder of Arduino, wants to know your thoughts, we posted a few questions so far, and we’re trying it out…

> massimo and team,
> 
> congrats on the release. for the new pro IDE alpha, is there (or what is) the process to add 3rd party boards? we can try that out to test it. if it’s not going to be supported that is fine, we just want to know what to suggest to people and what to expect. same for CREATE.

> some other confirmation/questions:

> *   the alpha is not open-source at this time during alpha, but will be later?
> *   the blog post says _“Support for additional languages other than C++”_ are there documentation/examples?

You can post up on the list, or t[ry the discussion on Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2019/10/21/the-arduino-ide-finally-grows-up/) where [Arduino seems to be answering questions](https://hackaday.com/2019/10/21/the-arduino-ide-finally-grows-up/#comment-6188739) but at this time comments were not working on Hackaday it seems?
