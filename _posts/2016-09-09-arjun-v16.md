**Arjun v1.6 - HTTP Parameter Discovery Suite**

  

**Introduction**  
Web applications use parameters (or queries) to accept user input, take the following example into consideration  
`[http://api.example.com/v1/userinfo?id=751634589](http://api.example.com/v1/userinfo?id=751634589)`  
This URL seems to load user information for a specific user id, but what if there exists a parameter named`admin`which when set to`True`makes the endpoint provide more information about the user?  
This is what[Arjun](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Arjun "Arjun")does, it finds valid HTTP parameters with a huge default dictionary of 25,980 parameter names.  
The best part? It takes less than 30 seconds to go through this huge list while making just 50-60 requests to the target.  
Want to know how Arjun does that?[Here's how](https://github.com/s0md3v/Arjun/wiki/How-Arjun-works%3F "Here's how").
