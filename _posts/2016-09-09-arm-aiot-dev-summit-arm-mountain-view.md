> **PyBadge Making Workshop**
> 
> Are you interested in learning and experiencing how to build inference at the edge? Then, the Adafruit Pybadge Making workshop is designed for you. Using Adafruit Pybadges, you will learn how to build inference at the edge and much more. The badge is set to recognize the words “yes” and “no” but are easy to retrain using any of the micro speech vocabulary. You can even flash new models on the badge. Join us in the Innovator lounge where we will show you how to do all this and more! Plus, you will get to take the badges home with you to continue your learning experience.
