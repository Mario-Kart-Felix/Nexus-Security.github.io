Ok, big-ish news from ARM. ARM announced the Cortex-M processor (M55) and the Arm Ethos-U55 micro neural processing unit (NPU). The Cortex-M55 will be the next round of chips for embedded devices, ARM is really promoting the increase of speed for machine learning models. Expect to hear about Cortex-M and Ethos-U for “Edge computing” a lot.

We’ll of get the chips as soon as possible so we can get some great hardware to run our BrainCraft projects using TensorFlow lite, as well as CircuitPython.
