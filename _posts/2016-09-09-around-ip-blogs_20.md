The IPKat once again has selected blogposts that contribute to the discussions on IP thought and practice. 

  

  

**Copyright **

  

  

In the Kluwer Copyright Blog, Christian Czychowski and Viktoria Kraetzig [**offer**](http://copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com/2019/10/14/copyright-as-a-censorship-right-a-critical-evaluation-of-two-current-preliminary-ruling-proceedings-of-the-cjeu/?print=print) their insights on two judgments given by the CJEU, in _Funke Medien_ (C-469/17) and _Spiegel Online GmbH_ (C-516/17), respectively (**[here](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/07/breaking-cjeu-rules-that-freedom-of.html), [here](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/07/breaking-cjeu-rules-that-use-of.html)**). The issue in both cases is whether copyright could be a right of censorship. 

  

The SpicyIP blog **[published](https://spicyip.com/2019/09/tips-industries-v-wynk-music-a-case-of-statutory-mis-interpretation.html)** Karan Dhalla's post that analyses the judgment rendered by the Bombay High Court in _Tips v.

**Patent **

  

  

In the EPlaw Patent blog, Pierre Véron **[reports](http://eplaw.org/fr-mermet-v-chavanoz-industrie-the-largest-ever-patent-infringement-damages-award-in-europe-e25000000-overturned-on-appeal-patent-held-invalid-for-lack-of-novelty-because-of-a-public/)** on the appeal decision in the _Mermet v. Chavanoz industrie_ case in France. The first instance court had awarded the plaintiff the largest ever amount in Europe for damages in a patent infringement case (€25,000,000). The court of appeal overturned this decision on the ground that the patent is invalid due to lack of novelty - Chavanoz had sold the patented product before the priority date of the patent. 

  

In IPwatchdog blog, Gene Quinn [**criticizes**](https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2019/10/13/huawei-patents-are-not-the-enemy/id=114485/) the claim made by the R Street Institute that patents are too strong and are inhibiting American companies in the race for leadership in the 5G marketplace and continued leadership in Artificial Intelligence (AI), this due to assertion by the Chinese telecommunications company, Huawei, of more than 200 patents against Verizon Communications earlier this year. Quinn argues that there may be legitimate security concerns around Huawei’s infrastructure, but to suggest that the company's patents are at the root of these threats is in a word—Absurd! 

  

  

**Trademark and GI **

  

  

Jeffrey H. Brochin, in Kluwer Trademark blog, [**reports**](http://trademarkblog.kluweriplaw.com/2019/10/15/trademark-case-cervejaria-petropolis-sa-v-ambev-s-a-usa/) the decision of the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in _Cervejaria Petropolis SA v. Ambev S.A_ case. The court held that single instance of display of a trademark on race car and jumpsuit did not establish intent to use the mark for the registered product. 

  

In the IPTango blog, Patricia Covarrubia **[reports](http://iptango.blogspot.com/2019/10/chile-vs-peru-battle-over-pisco.html)** the decision of the Peruvian Ministry of External Relations to appeal to the ruling of the Court of First Instance of Thailand against the registration of a Chilean association that intends to use the term “_Pisco_". “_Pisco_” is a grape brandy produced in Chile and Peru.
