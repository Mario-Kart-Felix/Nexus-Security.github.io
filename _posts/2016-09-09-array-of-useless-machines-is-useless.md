What’s the collective noun for a group of useless machines? A passel of useless machines? A failure? A waste? A 404?  Whatever you want to call it, \[Martin Raynsford\] has produced one here with this collection of [24 useless machines arranged into a 5 by 6 array](http://msraynsford.blogspot.com/2020/01/4x6-useless-machine.html). He produced it for an event at a hackerspace to amuse visitors, and it certainly seems to do the job in the video after the break.

\[Martin\] built the case by modifying the design of his [Useless Machine kit](https://www.ecwid.com/store/msraynsford/Useless-Machine-2-0-p91060816), stretching out the case to hold multiple mechanisms. The original plan was to use a 6 by 6 matrix, but that wouldn’t fit into the laser cutter, so it ended up with 24 mechanisms in a 5 by 6 array. All of those are driven by 2 AAA batteries, and the mechanisms are efficient enough that it survived a full day of button flipping before it began to run out of juice.

It’s a neat design and build, from the living edge to the neat design of the cover hinge that stops the cover falling into the inside of the case.
