> Architect and MIT professor [Carlo Ratti](https://www.dezeen.com/tag/carlo-ratti/) stokes the [surveillance](https://www.dezeen.com/tag/surveillance/) debate with his biennale exhibition, which is set in a working train station in China and uses [facial-recognition technology](https://www.dezeen.com/tag/facial-recognition/).
> 
> A part of the the Bi-City Biennale of Urbanism\\Architecture in Shenzhen, The Eyes of the City exhibition is now open at Futian station.

> As the exhibition’s chief curator, Ratti set out to provoke debate by employing facial-recognition technology and artificial intelligence to track visitors.
> 
> But in contrast to how the public might currently encounter those technologies in today’s public spaces, The Eyes of the City educates its visitors about what is happening and secures their explicit consent.
