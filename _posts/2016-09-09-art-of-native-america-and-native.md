[This exhibition](https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/art-of-native-america-diker-collection) and [Native Perspectives](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/curatorial-departments/the-american-wing/native-perspectives) are some of our favorite ongoing exhibitions at The Met!

> In conjunction with [Art of Native America: The Charles and Valerie Diker Collection](https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/art-of-native-america-diker-collection), contemporary Native artists and historians have been invited to respond to eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Euro-American works in the American Wingâ€™s collection.
