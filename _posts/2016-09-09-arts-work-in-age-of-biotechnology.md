> From “designer babies” to de-extinct woolly mammoths, recent developments in biotechnology have profoundly changed what we view as possible. But each of these possibilities brings with it its own slew of ethical considerations and anxieties. Is genetic engineering safe? Are we playing God? How far is too far (and will we be able to stop before we get there)?
> 
> A new exhibition organized by the NC State University Libraries and the Genetic Engineering and Society Center explores some of these fascinating possibilities and their consequences. _[Art’s Work in the Age of Biotechnology: Shaping Our Genetic Futures](https://research.ncsu.edu/ges/arts-work-in-biotech/)_ is on view at the Gregg Museum of Art & Design (on the grounds of NC State University’s campus) through March 15, 2020. Featuring an eclectic ray of works by artists, scientists, designers, and makers of all kinds, the show pushes viewers to take a closer look at biotechnologies through a multitude of creative lenses.
