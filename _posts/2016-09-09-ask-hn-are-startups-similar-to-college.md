I've just been rejected for undergrad at Stanford, the campus I hoped to accelerate my technopreneurship journey. I have been dealing with the rejection as an exercise of persistence because I recognise that I will have to face similar circumstances in startups with applying to incubators, pitching to investors, etc. Yet, I really hope startups aren't as much of a lottery game as admitting into top colleges are.

For those who have been through both the college and startup journey, could you share if you see any parallels between the two experiences. Does luck play an equally large factor?
