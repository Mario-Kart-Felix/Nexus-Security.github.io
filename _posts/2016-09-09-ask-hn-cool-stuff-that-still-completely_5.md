New top story on Hacker News: Ask HN: Cool stuff that's still completely unregulated? Things like drones, e-bikes, vapes and 3d printing have already received varying amounts of regulatory attention - I'm curious if anyone can think of very early trends that aren't regulated now but may be in the future. I'm asking partially out of curiosity, but also to get ideas for interesting project areas to brainstorm.
