New top story on Hacker News: Ask HN: How did your startup change after an exit? Hi HN I'm an engineering VP in a (maybe) unicorn looking seriously at an exit and the vibe has ... already changed. Looking at the current climate, I am probably going to be able to pay off my mortgage and send my partner to grad school, but financial independence or FYM isn't on the cards. I like it here, and am not planning to move on yet. I've been wondering where the stories about what happens (what goes wrong/right) after an exit, like an IPO. What should I be looking out for after the exit? Any experiences from senior engineering staff? Or even good blog posts or books? Thanks
