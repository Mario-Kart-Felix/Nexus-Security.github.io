I've spent the last decade in two FANG companies, and I've got to a high level where my total compensation is ridiculous.

The problem is that it bores me to tears, and I don't want to do it anymore.

At first thought, maybe I am burned out? However, I can still come home and write code for a side-project, so I don't think this is "burn-out". I don't know to be honest. I think the best description is that I am cynical of the "mission", and I can't connect my work to people I care about. How do I know what the source of the problem is?

However, I wanted to pose two questions.

First, what is the environment like for exiting high-level former-FANG employees?

Second, what are some of the surprises post-FANG that I would be in for if I wanted to start a company?

Thank you for your time.
