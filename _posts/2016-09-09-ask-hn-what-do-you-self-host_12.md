New top story on Hacker News: Ask HN: What do you self-host? I know this is has been posted before but that was a few years ago so I wanted to restart the discussion, as I love hearing about what people host at home. I am currently running an Unraid server with some docker containers, here are a few of them: Plex, Radarr, Sonarr, Ombi, NZBGet, Bitwarden, Storj, Hyrda, Nextcloud, NginxProxyManager, Unifi, Pihole, OpenVPN, InfluxDB, Grafana.
