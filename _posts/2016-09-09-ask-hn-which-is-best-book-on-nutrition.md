I wanted to read a book on nutrition which is backed by extensive research and is easily readable by a common person so that he/she can make changes in his/her lifestyle (especially vegetarian). Most of times, they are contradictory views related to diet and food we consume even in the top 10 results of google. I understand that diet is something which is dependent on person to person, but some universal truths like don't mix sour foods with dairy always work. This would help a lot, rather than me reading every other blog on which food combinations do not go well together, or is dairy good, is keto diet healthy, is plant-based diet better than others etc.
