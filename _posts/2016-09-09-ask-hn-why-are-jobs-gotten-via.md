Seems like companies believe the best hire is connected to their existing workforce in some way e.g. well known that most jobs are sourced through some internal referral.

And yet as a society we've increasingly moved on to blind dating via dating apps like Tinder instead of meeting people via a mutual connection.

Logically you'd think the "optimal" strategy for hiring and dating would be similar. In this case, either via a mutual connection or not.

And yet we see this divergence in strategy. Why is that?
