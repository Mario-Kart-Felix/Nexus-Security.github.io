> The European Space Agency has announced that astronaut Luca Parmitano successfully navigated a rover through an obstacle course to collect a rock sample all the way from the International Space Station. The obstacle course was located in the Netherlands where the test took place on Monday. The ESA developed the technology used to remotely operate rovers from space.
> 
> Rovers are a key technology for exploring planets, moons, and even big asteroids. NASA currently has two of its own rovers operating on Mars with plans to launch another soon. Other space agencies and private collectives have worked on creating their own rovers for other future space missions.
