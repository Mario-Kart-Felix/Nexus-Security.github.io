> [Lab-grown meat](https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/21/cultured-meat-public-perception/) is no longer confined to Earth — Aleph Farms and partners have [successfully grown](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aleph-farms-successfully-completed-the-first-slaughter-free-meat-experiment-in-space-300932806.html) meat in space for the first time. The experiment, conducted aboard the Russian section of the International Space Station on September 26th, used a [bioprinter](https://www.engadget.com/2015/05/18/loreal-is-3d-printing-its-own-human-skin-to-test-cosmetics/) from 3D Bioprinting Solutions to produce a cultivated beef steak. Aleph’s growth technique replicates cows’ muscle tissue regeneration process, just in artificial conditions — the only big change for spaceborne creation is the faster maturation, since you can print from all sides at once instead of coping with the limitations of gravity.

> It’s far from ready for mass production. However, Aleph’s Yoav Reisler [told](https://www.space.com/meat-grown-in-space-station-bioprinter-first.html)_Space.com_ that the company planned to build on the experiment and make synthetic beef steaks available on _terra firma_ using large-scale “bio-farms.”
