Dry reforming of methane (DRM) is the process of converting methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) into synthesis gas (syngas). Since CO2 and CH4 are the two most important atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs), as well as abundant and low-cost carbon sources, DRM has the potential to mitigate rising GHG emissions and simultaneously realize clean(er) fossil fuel utilization.
