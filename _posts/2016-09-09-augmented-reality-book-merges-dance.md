> Adrien Mondot and Claire Bardainne, who work together as the [Adrien M / Claire B Company](http://www.am-cb.net/) ([previously](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2015/01/pixel-a-mesmerizing-dance-performance-incorporating-digital-projection/)), explore the intersection of tangible and augmented reality in their multi-media projects. They recently launched a Kickstarter to support their latest project, [_Acqua Alta – Crossing the mirror_](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adrienmclaireb/acqua-alta). _Acqua Alta_ turns a seemingly simple pop-up book into an animated black-and-white world. Two figures move through the pages, battling rainstorms and walking through doorways, all seen through the portal of a tablet or smartphone.

> The duo tells Colossal that after their 2017 exhibition [Mirages & miracles](https://vimeo.com/248983439), they wanted to focus their efforts on an affordable medium at an intimate scale that still allowed for constructing volume. “After considering the AR algorithm, it was important to find a solution for the book to be a plane for each of the 10 double pages,” Mondot and Bardainne explain. “The magic happens only when the real space and the AR space are completely synced together.”
