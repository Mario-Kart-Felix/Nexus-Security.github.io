By Lidia Kelly MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia will not extradite an Iranian academic to the United States, Australia's attorney-general said over the weekend, following a 13-month detention of the researcher for allegedly exporting American-made military equipment to Iran. Attorney-General Christian Porter said in a statement that "in all the circumstances of this particular case" the academic, Reza Dehbashi Kivi, should not be extradited. "My decision was made in accordance with the requirements of Australian domestic legal processes and is completely consistent with the powers provided to the commonwealth attorney-general under our law," Porter said.
