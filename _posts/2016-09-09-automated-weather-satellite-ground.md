> This project will show you how to create a fully automated ground station that will receive and decode NOAA weather satellite images and upload them to your own website served from an Amazon AWS S3 bucket. With this project you donâ€™t need your own server or have to run your own website infrastructure. [Have a look at my AWS site that is updated automatically all day long](http://nootropicdesign.wx.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/).
