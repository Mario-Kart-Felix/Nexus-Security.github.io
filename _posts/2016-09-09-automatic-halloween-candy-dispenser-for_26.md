This awesome project was sent to us by Brent.

From Brent:

> We built an Automatic Halloween Candy Dispenser for Halloween  
> using two Arduino Uno boards and one of your IR Break Beam Sensors. The IR  
> Break Beam sensor was critical for getting this to work right.
> 
> We made a YouTube video showing our journey creating it.

**Thank you so much for sending this in Brent!**
