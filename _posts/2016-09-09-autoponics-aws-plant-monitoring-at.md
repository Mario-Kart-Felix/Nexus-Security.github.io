[AWS re:Invent posts on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AWSreInvent/status/1202712798062465024) about the Builder’s Fair – like a re:Invent science fair. The featured project was AutoPonics, they use AWS services to feed house plants based on hydration levels.

The project uses the Adafruit Blinka CircuitPython compatibility library for Python on SMC boards like the Raspberry Pi. It appears various sensors are used including temperature, humidity, UV level, and soil moisture.

The full source code for the project is on [GitHub here](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-builders-fair-projects/tree/master/reinvent-2019/autoponics/thing-app/sensors).
