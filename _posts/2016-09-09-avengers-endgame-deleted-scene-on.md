13 Reasons Why actress Katherine Langford filmed a scene for Marvel's Avengers: Endgame, but it was left on the cutting room floor. Langford never shared any official details about what the scene was, but now we know. Those who booted up Avengers: Endgame on the just-launched Disney+ streaming service might have noticed an "Extras" tab on the Endgame page which features a deleted scene: "Tony at the Way Station." This scene reveals all the details--_**SPOILERS FOLLOW BELOW.**_

Tony Stark, in the wake of his fatal hero moments, enters a ["metaphysical waystation"](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avengers-endgames-first-deleted-scene-revealed/1100-6466683/) where he meets a young woman named Morgan. After a period of uncertainty, he recognizes her as the daughter he had with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).

Morgan tells Stark that she "got to live \[and\] grow up," [according to GamesRadar](https://www.gamesradar.com/avengers-endgame-deleted-scene-love-you-3000-tony-morgan-disney-plus/). She later says to her father, "I'm proud of you" for sacrificing himself and saving humanity with this selfless and courageous act. The scene ends with Morgan telling her father, "I love you." Stark then leans in and plants a kiss on her cheek; he replies, "I love you 3000."

It's a nice scene, but it's not hard to see why it was cut. After all, the surviving members of The Avengers assembled for Stark's funeral which wrapped up his story in an emotional and impactful way.

Directors Joe and Anthony Russo [spoke about the deleted scene back in May](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avengers-endgames-first-deleted-scene-revealed/1100-6466683/) and why they decided to cut it.

"What we realized about it was we didn't feel an emotional association with the adult version of his daughter. It wasn't resonating with us on an emotional level, which is why we moved away \[from\] it," the Russos said. "The intention was that his future daughter forgave him, and gave him peace to go. And the idea felt resonant, but there were just too many ideas in an overly complicated movie."

This scene, and the entire Endgame movie, are now available to stream on Disney+. The film was initially expected to come to the streaming service in December, but [Disney moved up the release to launch day.](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avengers-endgame-coming-to-disney-plus-sooner-than/1100-6471221/)
