Millions of passengers use flights to go from one end of the globe to another with more than 100,000 flights taking off and landing every day. Aviation is a giant industry and if you are a business that is planning to enter this industry, you need to have a robust system that not only tracks flights but also gives you real-time information on airports, airline routes, and more. Another data point that is crucial to the business is the flight history data. Several services that give you access to these kinds of data, however, most of these services cost a lot. In this article, we are going to share a simple, cost-effective tool that gives you access to real-time flight tracking data. It’s called [Aviationstack API](https://aviationstack.com/) and here is a quick look at its features.

Pricing and Availability
------------------------

  

It is really hard to find such a good and powerful API that offers businesses flight tracking data in real-time. And, if you do find such a service, it’s going to cost you a lot. That’s where Aviationstack API stands out from the crowd. Not only it offers a reasonable pricing model, it also offers a free plan which is something unheard of in this industry. Of course, the free plan is quite limited, however, it’s good enough to get started. Also, remember that the free plan comes with a personal license. **You get 500 API requests per month and access to real-time flights and full aviation data**. You will, however, not get access to historical flight data, encryption support, and airline routes data.  

![Pricing - Aviationstack API](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Pricing-Aviationstack-API.jpg)

I think for most small businesses, the Basic plan will be more than enough. **It will cost $49.99/month ($39.99/month if billed yearly) and get you a commercial license,** 10,000 API requests and all the features of the software except the “Extended Limit”. Big businesses can go for the Professional plan that costs $149.99/month ($119.99/month if billed annually). It gets you 50,000 API requests per month and all the features.  

Finally, there’s the business plan which **costs $499.99/month ($399.99/month if billed yearly) and allows you to make up to 250,000 requests a month**. If your company needs are even higher than this, you can always contact them to get a custom plan made just for you.
