Honor is expected to further beef up its smartphone portfolio in India with new launches, possibly the [Honor 9X and 9X Pro](https://beebom.com/honor-9x-india-launch-confirmed/), really soon. The Chinese giant has **launched a super affordable AM115 half in-ear wired earphone** in the meantime.  

Honor AM115 half in-ear earphones, as you can in the image below, sport a plastic build and are resemblant to Apple’s wired Earpods. I’m not really a fan of plastic earbuds and prefer silicon in-ear style earphones.  

Honor boasts that its half in-ear earphones combine the merits of in-ear and traditional earphones. They **offer a comfortable and snugly fit**, along with enhanced mid-range performance and bass because of the rear air vents on each earbud. There’s an **in-line remote control** on board, which sports 3 buttons to control playback and volume. It’s housing the microphone as well.

Honor AM115 earphones are also said to be quite durable as the company says **it has been subject to 69 stringent testings** including drop tests, tension tests, a button-pressing test, and temperature tests.  

Honor AM115 half in-earphones are **priced at a very reasonable Rs. 399** and will be available only in a single white color variant. It is already up for sale on Amazon India, which means you don’t have to wait to get these. I have already ordered a pair to test them out and you could too, just use the link down below.
