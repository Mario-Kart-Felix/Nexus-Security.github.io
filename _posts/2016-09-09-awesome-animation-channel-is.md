Once \[Shabab\] clued us in to [the brilliant animations of \[Jared Owen\]](https://www.youtube.com/user/captainranic), we pretty much lost an afternoon exploring this incredible YouTube channel. Self-taught Blender wizard \[Jared\] combines fantastic animations with clear and concise explanations for the inner workings of everything from [Nerf guns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8JpePwvuHw) and [Fisher-Price corn poppers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK-_JlxdGfk) to [the International Space Station](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLrOnEmy_GA).

Space nerds and casuals alike should check out \[Jared\]’s crowning achievement: a [three-video Apollo spacecraft series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLgVMn8k8t5JNRHrfd58sHHh0mbsPS7m_9&v=8dpkmUjJ8xU), which covers many details in a short amount of time. Want more Apollo? Here’s [a deeper dive into the lunar module](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX8-IXdABuc). \[Jared\] uses music to great effect in these videos, especially in the Apollo series.

Several videos are devoted to mechanisms, like the humble [gumball machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3ZeUNDg4fQ), [the grand piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDvS2V7HbnY), and [the combination lock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sftkP4CjjZs). In addition to all the great how-it-works videos, \[Jared\] explores various noteworthy buildings. You know there’s a bowling alley in the White House, right? [\[Jared\]’s tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW6hxlThB_o) shows you exactly where it is.

We love the diversity of the videos, [all of which \[Jared\] researches in great detail](https://www.blendernation.com/2018/11/19/meet-the-artist-jared-owen/). He enjoys working from user suggestions, so let him know what you’re dying to see dissected in detail.

Thanks for the tip, \[Shabab\].
