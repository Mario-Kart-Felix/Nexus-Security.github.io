AWS Wavelength enables developers to build applications that deliver single-digit millisecond latencies to mobile devices and end-users. AWS developers can deploy their applications to Wavelength Zones, AWS infrastructure deployments that embed AWS compute and storage services within the telecommunications providers’ datacenters at the edge of the 5G networks, and seamlessly access the breadth of AWS services in the region. This enables developers to deliver applications that require single-digit millisecond latencies such as game and live video streaming, machine learning inference at the edge, and augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR).

AWS Wavelength brings AWS services to the edge of the 5G network, minimizing the latency to connect to an application from a mobile device. Application traffic can reach application servers running in Wavelength Zones without leaving the mobile provider’s network. This reduces the extra network hops to the Internet that can result in latencies of more than 100 milliseconds, preventing customers from taking full advantage of the bandwidth and latency advancements of 5G.

Wavelength delivers a consistent developer experience across multiple 5G networks around the world, allowing you to build the next generation of ultra-low latency applications using familiar AWS services, APIs, and tools. You can simply extend your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to one or more Wavelength Zones and then use AWS resources like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volumes, AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Services (EKS), AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), AWS CloudFormation, and AWS Autoscaling to build, run, secure, manage, and scale your applications. With just an AWS account, you can deploy your 5G applications in Wavelength Zones and seamlessly connect to applications and services in AWS Regions. Wavelength offers you the flexibility to scale up or scale down, and pay only for the resources that you use.

Getting started is easy, you simply log-in to the AWS Management Console and enable the Wavelength Zones you want to use for your account.
