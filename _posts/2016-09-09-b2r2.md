**B2R2 - Collection Of Useful Algorithms, Functions, And Tools For Binary Analysis**

B2R2 is a collection of useful algorithms, functions, and tools for **binary analysis**, written purely in F# (in .NET lingo, it is purely managed code). B2R2 has been named after [R2-D2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R2-D2 "R2-D2"), a famous fictional robot appeared in the Star Wars. In fact, B2R2's original name was _B2-R2_, but we decided to use the name _B2R2_ instead, because .NET does not allow dash (-) characters in identifiers (or namespaces). The name essentially represents "binary" or "two": "binary" itself means "two" states anyways. "B" and "2" mean "binary", and "R" indicates _reversing_.

  
**B2R2?**

1.  B2R2 is _analysis-friendly_: it is written in F#, which provides all the syntactic goodies for writing program analyzers, such as pattern matching, algebraic data types, and etc.
2.  B2R2 is _fast_: it has a fast and efficient front-end engine for binary analysis, which is written purely in a functional way. Therefore, it naturally supports _pure parallelism_ for binary disassembling, lifting and IR optimization.
3.  B2R2 is _easy_ to play with: there is absolutely no dependency hell for B2R2 because it is a fully-managed library. All you need to do is to install [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download ".NET Core SDK"), and you are ready to go! Native [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2017 "IntelliSense") support is another plus!
4.  B2R2 is _OS-Independent_: it works on Linux, Mac, Windows, and etc. as long as .NET core supports it.
5.  B2R2 is _interoperable_: it is not bound to a specific language. Theoretically, you can use B2R2 APIs with any [CLI supported languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CLI_languages "CLI supported  languages").

  
**Features?**  
Currently, our focus is on the front-end of binary analysis, which includes binary parser, lifter, and optimizer. B2R2 natively supports parallel lifting, which is a new technique we introduced in 2019 NDSS Bar. Please refer to our [paper](https://github.com/B2R2-org/B2R2#citation "paper") for more details about the technique as well as our design decisions. We also have our own back-end tools such as symbolic executor, but we are _not_ planning to open-source them yet. Nevertheless, B2R2 includes several useful middle-end or back-end features such as ROP chain compilation, CFG building, and automatic graph drawing, and etc. B2R2 also comes with a simple command-line utility that we call [`BinExplorer`](https://github.com/B2R2-org/B2R2/blob/master/src/Utilities/BinExplorer "B2R2 is a collection of useful algorithms, functions, and tools for binary analysis. (11)"), which can help explore such features using a simple [command line](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Command%20Line "command line") interface.  
  
**Dependencies?**  
B2R2 relies on a tiny set of external .NET libraries, and our design principle is to use a minimum number of libraries. Below is a list of libraries that we leverage.

*   [System.Reflection.Metadata](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Reflection.Metadata/ "System.Reflection.Metadata")
*   [Microsoft.FSharpLu.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.FSharpLu.Json/ "Microsoft.FSharpLu.Json")
*   [FParsec](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FParsec "FParsec")

  
**API Documentation**  
We currently use docfx to generate our documentation: [https://b2r2.org/APIDoc/](https://b2r2.org/APIDoc/ "https://b2r2.org/APIDoc/")  
  
**Example**  
Let's try to use B2R2 APIs.

1.  First we create an empty directory `DIRNAME`:  
    ```
    mkdir DIRNAME
    ```
2.  We then create an empty console project with `dotnet` command line:  
    ```
    $ dotnet new console -lang F#
    ```
3.  Add our nuget package _B2R2.FrontEnd_ to the project:  
    ```
    $ dotnet add package B2R2.FrontEnd
    ```
4.  Modify the `Program.fs` file with your favorite editor as follows:  
    
    ```
    open B2R2  
    open B2R2.FrontEnd  
      
    []  
    let main argv =  
      let isa = ISA.OfString "amd64"  
      let bytes = [| 0x65uy; 0xffuy; 0x15uy; 0x10uy; 0x00uy; 0x00uy; 0x00uy |]  
      let handler = BinHandler.Init (isa, bytes)  
      let ins = BinHandler.ParseInstr handler 0UL  
      ins.Translate handler.TranslationContext |> printfn "%A"  
      0
    ```
    
5.  We then just run it by typing: `dotnet run`. You will be able see lifted IR statements from your console. That's it! You just lifted an Intel instruction with only few lines of F# code!

  
**Build**  
Building B2R2 is fun and easy. All you need to do is to install .NET Core SDK 3.0 or above. Yea, that's it!

*    To build B2R2 in release mode, type `make release` or `dotnet build -c Release` in the source root.
*    To build B2R2 in debug mode, type `make`, or `dotnet build` in the source root.

**Why Reinventing the Wheel?**  
There are many other great tools available, but we wanted to build a _functional-first_ binary [analysis](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Analysis "analysis") platform that is painless to install and runs on any platform without any hassle. B2R2 is in its _infancy_ stage, but we believe it provides a rich set of library functions for binary analysis. It also has a strong front-end that is easily adaptable and extendible! Currently it reliably supports x86 and x86-64, meaning that we have heavily tested them; and it partially supports ARMv7 (and Thumb), ARMv8, MIPS32, and MIPS64, meaning that they work, but we haven't tested them thorougly yet.  
  
**Features to be Added?**  
Below is a list of features that we plan to add in the future: the list is totally incomplete. Some of them are work in progress, but we look forward your contributions! Feel free to write a PR (Pull Requst) while making sure that you have read our [contribution guideline](https://github.com/B2R2-org/B2R2/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md "contribution guideline").

*   Implement CFG recovery algorithms.
*   Implement [assembler](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Assembler "assembler") for currently supported ISAs using a parser combinator.
*   Support for floating point operations.
*   Support for more architectures such as PPC.
