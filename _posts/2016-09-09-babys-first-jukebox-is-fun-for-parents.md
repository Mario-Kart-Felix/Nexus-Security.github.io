Believe it or not, there’s a $400 toy mp3 player out there for kids. It looks pretty nice, with colorful buttons and a wood console and all, but those features don’t really justify the price tag. \[DerThes\] wanted one for his 2-year-old anyway, so [he made his own ruggedized version](https://imgur.com/a/S2kZkn8#JTQT8Mw) for a whole lot less.

The simple and kid-friendly interface lets \[DerThes Jr.\] choose from one of nine albums to play by pushing one of the candy-colored buttons. The bottom row of buttons handle play/pause and moving through the track list. When mom and dad get tired of listening to whatever the kids are into these days, they can enter the special god mode code to access 99 of their favorite albums.

This baby boombox is built with an Arduino Uno and an Adafruit music maker shield. \[DerThes\] etched his own PCB to hold the buttons and the pair of shift registers needed to interface them with the Uno. If you’ve never etched before, here’s a good chance to dip your toe in the ferric chloride, because \[DerThes\] has the transparency in [his repo](https://github.com/MichaelThessel/arduino-stoerbert) and a line on a nice instructional video.

If you don’t think your toddler is ready to respect a field of momentaries, [you could make a jukebox with NFC blocks](https://hackaday.com/2014/10/09/toddler-jukebox-requires-no-quarters-or-button-mashing/).
