Via the [“What I Made Today” blog](http://www.whatimade.today/babysleeper/) comes a project to place in a baby’s room to provide light and to monitor the room.

> We have reached that age where friends and family around starting to have babies. Giving my friend’s project, I’ve decided to build some nice gifts, and via these gifts, dive in for the first time into the Arduino/IOT world.
> 
> Well, the project is A baby sleeping-environment-sensing and climate-control.
> 
> *   ESP32 (note that Amir’s tutorials uses an ESP8266)
> *   DHT22 / AM2302 temperature & humidity sensors
> *   WS2812 led strip (NeoPixels)
> *   WS2812 connector
> *   IR transmitter (for AC) – didn’t used them eventually
> *   MW2 smoke detector
> *   Power supply & USB cable
> 
> Total amount of 32 dollars.

As far as experience:

> This is the first time I’m making an Arduino project, let alone messing with the ESP32, moreover – building an IOT device, with sensing and posting sensed data to a local server. I must say that every component, and every piece of code, there’s huge amount of documentation and tutorials. All is left is to read and explore this magnificent world.

For more, check out the [post/tutorial](http://www.whatimade.today/babysleeper/). For projects code, [refer to the github](https://github.com/GalBrandwine/BabySleeper). The code is well documented where the pin connections are thoroughly explained.
