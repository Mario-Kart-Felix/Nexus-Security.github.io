Areas of skin that have been damaged by an injury are ideal niches for the concentration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium which impairs the healing process in tissue and creates favorable conditions for infections. Because of its resistance to most available antibiotics, this bacterium is in the "Priority 1 / CRITICAL" category of the World Health Organization's (WHO) global list of priority pathogens.
