> PEEKSKILL, N.Y., November 8, 2019 — It’s official! Bantam Tools is bringing tech to Peekskill and the Hudson Valley. The light manufacturing company is celebrating its move from Berkeley, California, to its new headquarters at 135 N. Water Street, Peekskill, New York, with a commemorative ribbon cutting ceremony on Monday, November 18, 2019, at 10:30 a.m. New York Lt. Governor Kathy Hochul and Peekskill Mayor Andre Rainey will be on hand to help cut the ribbon with Bantam Tools CEO Bre Pettis. A tour the new facility will be provided.
> 
> “The Bantam Tools manufacturing space and headquarters is just the first of four revitalized buildings in Peekskill’s new hub of innovation and manufacturing to open,” noted Bre Pettis, CEO of Bantam Tools, who purchased 135, 150, 189 and 190 N. Water Street. “To be able to manufacture our desktop CNC machines in the United States and specifically, build them in Peekskill, is a great accomplishment. Moving the company from the San Francisco Bay Area to Peekskill signifies a goal to build a sustainable tech company in the Hudson Valley — in a town with a diverse community, natural beauty and affordable living all within an easy distance to New York City— is something that is very important to helping create happy employees.”
> 
> Bantam Tools makes desktop CNC machines with professional reliability and precision at an affordable price. Bantam Tools’ machines are easy to set up and work as expected right out of the box, allowing the user to stay ahead of schedule and under budget, no matter the project. The Bantam Tools Desktop PCB Milling Machine is small enough to fit down the hatch of a submarine and used by the world’s leading electrical engineers, designers and digital fabricators.
> 
> The new Bantam Tools manufacturing facility in Peekskill will eventually employ around 50 designers, engineers, technicians, assembly workers, marketing and sales staff, and will be hiring for new positions as the company gets settled into its new home. The other three buildings at the site are being developed to house a potential maker space, tech incubator, classroom space, a ceramics manufacturing business and studio for artists and creators. The site also benefited from economic development funds from the State of New York and is zoned for light manufacturing with the WF-2 and WF-3 zones. Pettis envisions the buildings on N. Water Street as being a “hub of innovation and manufacturing for the Hudson Valley.”
> 
> Bre Pettis is the former co-founder and CEO of the 3D printing company MakerBot, which he sold in 2013. He purchased Bantam Tools in 2017 and has been working toward bringing the company to Peekskill for the past two years.
> 
> Bantam Tools produces hardware and software to help designers and engineers explore the frontier of digital fabrication.. The Bantam Tools Desktop PCB Milling Machine is the company’s flagship product and is relied on by over 150 university labs and makerspaces around the world including MIT, NYU and Stanford as well as companies and organizations such as Adafruit, Supplyframe DesignLab and all branches of the US military.
