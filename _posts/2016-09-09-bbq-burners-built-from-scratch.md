Building a barbecue is a common DIY pursuit, and one that comes with a tasty payoff at completion. While many projects focus on charcoal or wood-fired designs, \[Andrew\] is more of a gas man. Not one to simply buy off the shelf, [he designed his own burners from scratch.](https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-BBQ-Burner/)

This quest wasn’t just [unnecessary yak shaving](https://hackaday.com/2016/08/09/yak-shaving-hacker-mode-vs-maker-mode/); burners to suit \[Andrew\]’s desired size and power simply weren’t available. The burner is designed around the Venturi effect, wherein the propane gas is passed through a small orifice, creating a jet and pulling air along with it as it enters the burner tube. This causes the gases to mix, and they can then be ignited when passing through the outlet holes of the burner. Get the orifice and outlet holes sized just right, and you’ll have a burner that produces a hot, blue flame, perfect for efficient cooking.

The orifice was produced with brass plumbing components, and hooked up to a valve rated for use with gas lines. The burner tube itself was created from stainless steel tube, with slots cut to act as outlet holes and with the end crimped and welded shut. A black iron pipe reducer was then used as the air inlet and orifice mount.

The final result is a powerful barbecue burner that is perfectly sized to \[Andrew\]’s needs. If you’re keen to build your own custom rig, you may find this a useful and cheap way to go versus sourcing parts off the shelf. [We’ve seen \[Andrew\]’s work before, too](https://hackaday.com/2019/12/07/beer-keg-becomes-high-performance-pizza-oven/). Video after the break.
