In the market for a low-poly change to your look? Hate the idea of showing up for a costume party only to find out someone is wearing the same mask as you? Then [this face changing front-projection mask](https://www.instructables.com/id/Face-Changing-Projection-Mask-Be-Anything/) may be just the thing for you.

To be honest, we’re not sure just how much \[Sean Hodgins\]’ latest project has to do with cosplay. He seems to be making a subtle commentary about dealing with life in the surveillance state, even though this is probably not a strategy for thwarting facial-recognition cameras. \[Ed Note: Or maybe it’s just Halloween?\]

The build consists of a Raspberry Pi and a pico projector of the kind [we’ve seen before](https://hackaday.com/2019/04/07/a-petite-pico-projector-for-portable-pi/). These are mated together via a custom PCB and live inside a small enclosure that’s attached to the end of a longish boom. The boom attaches to the chin of 3D-printed mask, which in turn is connected to the suspension system of a welding helmet. Powered by a battery pack and controlled by a smartphone app, the projector throws whatever you want onto the mask – videos, effects, even images of other people. Even with some Photoshop tweaks to account for keystone distortion from the low angle of projection, there’s enough distortion that the effect is more artistic than masquerade. But honestly, having your face suddenly burst into flames is pretty cool. We just wonder what visibility is like for the wearer with a bright LED blasting into your eyes.

As a bonus, \[Sean\] has worked this build into a virtual treasure hunt. Check out [13thkey.com](http://www.13thkey.com/) and see what you can make from the minimal clues there.

\[Itay Ramot\] spotted this one for us. Thanks!
