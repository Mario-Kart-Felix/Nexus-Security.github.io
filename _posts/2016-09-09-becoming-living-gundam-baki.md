[Brian Chen](https://www.hackster.io/bc24), who came up with the [Superior Automated Gauntlet Apparatus (S.A.G.A.)](https://brianbuilds.home.blog/2019/08/26/projectsaga/) ia [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/bc24/b-a-k-i-breakthrough-automated-kannon-instrument-d21824)

> In my ongoing campaign to become a living GUNDAM, after I finished the S.A.G.A. ([Superior Assault Gauntlet Apparatus](https://brianbuilds.home.blog/2019/08/26/projectsaga/)) project for my forearms, I decided the next body part I would weaponize would be my deltads (shoulders lol). I wanted to create a shoulder cannon that could target and fire automatically, like Marvel’s War Machine.
> 
> Problem was, the only things I had ever programmed in were MATLAB and Arduino, both for very simple applications. In order to create a cannon that could auto-target, I needed something with more computational power. So I enrolled in ENGI 301 to learn Python and take the next step forward in programming.
> 
> Before going for the full shoulder cannon right away, I chose to create a stationary defense turret first, to keep things simple. Well, simpler.
