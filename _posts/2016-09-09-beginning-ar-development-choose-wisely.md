Augmented reality is poised to play a big role in our looming digital futures. Developers interested in crafting that future have several competing tools to choose from. Circuit Stream offers a helpful overview to help you pick your AR path:

> The AR development industry is highly competitive with major tech companies amply investing into their own AR software development kits (SDK). Apple released their ARKit back in 2017, and just one year later Google presented ARCore. There are four major AR SDKs today: ARkit, ARCore, Vuforia and AR Foundation.
> 
> ARKit is a set of tools created by Apple to aid developers in creating augmented reality applications for iOS devices.
> 
> ARCore is Google’s answer to Apple’s ARKit. It’s a development platform for creating augmented reality applications that was released in early 2018.
> 
> Vuforia is one of the oldest AR companies on the market. After its acquisition in 2015 by PTC Inc., Vuforia has expanded its line of AR-oriented tools.
> 
> AR Foundation is a package that lets you build cross-platform AR applications in Unity3D.
