CM Punk is the best in the world at what he does best, and that's wrestle--and talk on the mic. When the wrestler left WWE in 2014, it was a shock to fans, and we never thought we'd see him again. Well, he's returned to WWE now, as a commentator for the FS1 show WWE Backstage.

WWE Backstage's Renee Young made the big reveal on the November 12 episode of the weekly series. "Cult of Personality" by Living Colour played, and CM Punk walked out and said, "It's as simple as this. Just when they think they've got the answers, I change the culture. I'll see you here next week."

Punk left WWE in 2014 after the Royal Rumble. He stated he was retiring from wrestling--which led him to a career in MMA with UFC for a brief stint--and in November of that year, the infamous Art of Wrestling podcast with Colt Cabana dropped where Punk opened up about his departure from the company--which included Punk being fired on his wedding day.

Seeing Punk involved with WWE again is a shock and a welcome surprise, as no one thought he'd return at this point. Punk will be back on WWE Backstage as a special guest commentator and analyst next week.

There's no news at this time for how long this gig will last, but hopefully, this will be a longer-term deal. Aside from his incredible talents in the ring, Punk is known for his mic skills, including the infamous "pipe bomb" segment from 2011, where the wrestler sat at the entrance ramp and unleashed all his grievances with WWE.

WWE Backstage airs on FS1, Tuesdays at 11 PM ET.
