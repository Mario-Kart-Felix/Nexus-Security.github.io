Ahead of the imminent launch of Apple's new 16-inch [MacBook Pro](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/), several benchmark results have appeared on [Geekbench](https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/search?q=MacBookPro16%2C1) that allegedly come from a Mac model designated “MacBookPro16,1” and, if true, confirm some of the machine's rumored hardware specifications.

Many of the results indicate that the 16-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ will feature Intel 9th-generation Coffee Lake Refresh processors, which would be in line with the 15-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ released in May. Some benchmarks show an 8-core Core i9 processor with a 2.4GHz base clock speed.  
  
  
  
  
  
In addition, [OpenCL scores](https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/compute/240983) list the machines as having Radeon Pro 5300M and 5500M graphics, and up to 32GB RAM. We've spotted references to Radeon Pro 5300M and 5500M in [macOS Catalina](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-10-15/) code, so there's a good chance these are legit.
