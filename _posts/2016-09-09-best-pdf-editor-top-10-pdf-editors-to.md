PDF (aka Portable Document Format) has become a sort of go-to file format, especially in a professional environment. And rightly so, as it’s not only compatible but also more secure than other file formats. The one thing where PDF lacks is the ability to edit the document. That’s exactly what creates the need to have a PDF editing app to edit, annotate, or even convert other file types into PDFs. While the market is full of PDF editors, not all of them are secure and perform the assigned tasks with the desired efficiency. To help you track down the right contender for your professional or personal demand, we have lined up some of the best PDF editors that get the job done. So, let’s explore the roundup and pick out a complete PDF solution right now!  

Top 10 PDF Editors You Shouldn’t Miss Out in 2020
-------------------------------------------------

  

When it comes to choosing a PDF editor, you’ve got to be very selective. Therefore, I think a little brainstorming up front is a must.  

### What PDF Editor Should You Choose?

  

Let’s get the big elephant out of the way first up! The choice of your PDF editor boils down to two pivotal aspects: Professional and Personal needs. Though other essential factors like proficiency, ease-of-use, and affordability also have major roles to play. If efficiency and top-of-the-line tools matter a lot and you are skilled enough to get the most out of advanced editing features, go for a full-fledged PDF editor. That’s as straightforward as it sounds.  

But just in case you have to deal with PDFs only once in a blue moon, then opt for lightweight or online PDF editors that are available for free. Most of them come with all the basic tools to let you convert and annotate PDF files with ease. Keeping both the requirements in mind, we have selected both paid and free PDF editing apps/software. Now that the talk is over, it’s the right time to get started.  

1\. Foxit PhantomPDF
--------------------

  

If versatility tops your priority list, Foxit PhantomPDF would be the right answer to your needs. Despite being a powerful PDF editor, PhantomPDF is pretty easy to maneuver, allowing you to **create and edit docs at will**.

Another notable feature is the PDF converter that lets you **convert docs into PDFs** without disturbing the layout, which is a big deal if you don’t want to compromise with quality.

As someone who has to deal with PDFs more often than not especially in professional environments, I always look for a **seamless collaboration feature**. And from what I have experienced, PhantomPDF looks good enough to provide an intuitive collaboration so that the entire team can work together on a project. Moreover, it also allows easy sharing and **integration with ECMs and cloud storage** which can be quite helpful for businesses.

3\. Wondershare PDFelement

If I were to pick an **all-in-one PDF editor** that can meet the demand of both pros and normal users, I would go for Wondershare PDFelement. What gives this software an edge over many other counterparts is the flexibility.

4\. Adobe Acrobat Reader DC

In the seemingly crowded market of PDF editors, “Adobe Acrobat Reader” has always stood out for me.
