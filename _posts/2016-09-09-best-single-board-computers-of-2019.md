*   Before you guys go crazy over how this is not SBC but a microcontroller instead, we felt that it was appropriate to include it into the list as it is a microcontroller that is a Linux-ready SBC with full Arduino compatibility.
*   Seeeduino Cloud is a microcontroller board based on [Dragino WiFi IoT module HE](http://www.dragino.com/products/linux-module/item/87-he.html) and ATmega32u4. HE is a high performance, low cost 150M, 2.4G WiFi module which means “core” in Chinese and with an Open Source OpenWrt system inside.
*   Seeeduino Cloud is also 100% compatible with Grove, shield and IDEs(Arduino IDE 1.5.3 and later).
*   Except for the normal interface of Arduino, Seeeduino Cloud has built-in Ethernet and WiFi support, a USB-A port which makes it very suitable for those prototype design that needs network connection and mass storage. It is also a good idea to make Seeeduino Cloud to an IoT gateway.
*   Historically, interfacing Arduino with complex web services has been quite a challenge due to the limited memory available. Web services tend to use verbose text-based formats like XML that require quite a lot of ram to parse. On the Cloud, you can use the Yun Bridge library which delegates all network connections and processing of HTTP transactions to the Linux machine.
*   Specs

*   Why did we include this microcontroller? Well, even though it is based around microcontrollers instead of a microprocessor, it has shared characteristics as the Raspberry Pi 4 in budget hardware and STEM education.
*   While both boards can control electronics attached to their pins, the Pi is also capable of being used as a full desktop computer but the Arduino is easier to use when building electronic prototypes, and also to swap out for a new microcontroller in the final product. So do pick which microcontroller or SBC that suits your project the most!
*   The Seeeduino Mega is a powerful micro-controller derived from Arduino Mega. It features ATmega2560 processor which brings a large number of I/O pins, as much as 70 digital I/O, 16 analog inputs, 14 PWM, and 4 hardware serial ports.
*   Compared to Arduino Mega, we shrunk the volume of Arduino Mega by at least 30% and made it 100% compatible with Seeed Shield products. And as a member of Seeeduino series, Seeeduino Mega inherits deliberate details from Seeeduino, like selectable operating voltage(3.3V/5V), right angle reset button, and so on.
*   If you are looking to create robotic projects or you want something for a 3D printer, the Seeeduino Mega will be a handy replacement to Raspberry Pi even though it is based on a microcontroller and not a microprocessor.
