> The HiPERCAM instrument on the Gran Telescopio Canarias at La Palma in the Canary Islands and the X-ray-sensitive NICER instrument aboard the International Space Station gave an international team of astronomers led by the University of Southhampton a bird’s eye view of a black hole system known as MAXI J1820+070.
