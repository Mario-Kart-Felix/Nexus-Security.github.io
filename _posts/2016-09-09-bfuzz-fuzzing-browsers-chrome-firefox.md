**Domato**  
The testcase's inwards `recurve` are generated past times [domato](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/domato) generator.py contains the primary script. It uses grammar.py equally a library in addition to contains additional helper code for DOM fuzzing.  
grammar.py contains the generation engine that is to a greater extent than oftentimes than non application-agnostic in addition to tin so live on used inwards other (i.e. non-DOM) generation-based fuzzers.
