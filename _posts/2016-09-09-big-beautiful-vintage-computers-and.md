An IBM 3380E disk storage system, 5 gigabyte capacity.

\[Ken Shirriff\] recently shared some pictures and a writeup from his visit to the [Large Scale Systems Museum](http://www.righto.com/2019/10/a-visit-to-large-scale-systems-museum.html), a remarkable private collection of mainframes and other computers from the 1970s to the 1990s. Housed in a town outside Pittsburgh, it contains a huge variety of specimens including IBM mainframes and desk-sized minicomputers, enormous disk and tape storage systems, and multiple 90s-era Cray supercomputers. It doesn’t stop there, either. Everything through the minicomputer revolution leading to personal home computers is present, and there are even several Heathkit HERO robot kits from the 80s. (By the way, we once saw a HERO [retrofitted with wireless and the ability to run Python](https://hackaday.com/2012/09/09/wireless-upgrade-for-a-heathkit-hero-1-robot/).)

Something really special is that many of the vintage systems are in working order, providing insight into how these units performed and acted. The museum is a private collection and [is open only by appointment](http://largescalesystemsmuseum.org/) but they encourage interested parties not to be shy. If a trip to the museum isn’t for you, \[Ken\] has some [additional photos from his visit here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/WytLVLm3jSYiuw9a9) for you to check out.
