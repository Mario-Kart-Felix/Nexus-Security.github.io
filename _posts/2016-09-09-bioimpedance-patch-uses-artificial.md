> As the device is worn on the chest, and is fairly unobtrusive, it has the potential to allow for sleep apnea diagnosis outside of sleep clinics. This may improve the quality of diagnoses, as patients will be able to perform testing under normal conditions in their own bed, [reports MedGadget](https://www.medgadget.com/2020/02/onera-bioimpedance-patch-to-detect-sleep-apnea.html).

> “When a patient breathes, air enters the lungs and the chest expands, resulting in impedance changes in the chest,” explains Tom Van Steenkiste, a researcher involved in the study. “By measuring bioimpedance on the chest… respiration can be estimated.”
