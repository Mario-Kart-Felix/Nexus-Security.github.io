> Biology, first and foremost. Biology is the science I initially chose to study, and it will never cease to inspire me. Ultimately, however, the boundaries between disciplines are not that rigid. For my PhD, I studied the long-term development of boreal peatlands, which meant exposure to broader aspects of environmental science: hydrology, carbon cycling, paleoenvironmental reconstruction, and climate change science. While I find these subjects less directly tangible than biology (and certainly harder to draw!), all of them may influence my work conceptually.

> My main form of expression to date has been drawing, and a year ago, I would have told you that the materials I use are quite old-fashioned: paper, pencils (graphite and colour), and ink, with the occasional digital piece for variety. But after developing a coherent body of work for a solo show in early 2019, I really felt I needed some time to experiment. So between then and now, I have tried all sorts of things. First, I ventured into 3D, which involved using paper, driftwood, old textiles, photographs, and even an old room divider. I loved the creative process involved, so this is definitely something I plan to develop further. I have also tried to push the boundaries of my drawing. For my my most recent piece I used acrylic ink on wood panel, which made for an interesting cross between drawing and painting. Working on panel also makes it easy to work large-format, which I love. So in the short term, that is what I plan to do more of.
