Welcome to BitBar,  
  
The BitBar app lets you put the output from any script or program right in your Mac OS X menu bar. And it's [completely free](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar#its-free-so-please-donate). An impressive number of plugins have already been [contributed by a wide range of developers](https://getbitbar.com/contributors) just like you, and this site makes it easy to find them.  
  
I hope you find something useful in our repository (you can use the links to the left or the search above to have a look around). If there's something missing - please consider [contributing a plugin of your own](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar#writing-plugins).  
  
Thanks,
