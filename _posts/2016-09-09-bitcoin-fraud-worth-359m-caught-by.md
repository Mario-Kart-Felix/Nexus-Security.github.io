The Brazilian police have found what is said to be an alleged Bitcoins fraud that stole $ 359M from the sufferers. "The Brazillian state police have been able to counter the anonymous operation and have caught 9 criminals," says the Parana state government in a statement. "Growing concern in crypto-currency businesses has been followed by an increase of scams,” the report states. “The absence of supervision and attention along with large levels of distraction, unfamiliarity, cross-perimeter activities, and other characteristics crucial to the cryptocurrency business reveals possible dangers to the users," says Brazilian Congressman Aureo Ribeiro.

The 4 months inquiry exposed five hundred personalities from over 6 states that have fallen prey to the Bitcoin grant fraud. However, the figures could go up to 5000 persons. “It was obvious that the plan was a fraud when the victims got a notification from the organization, informing the users that the investors would not be able to debit their money for 6 months,” says the Parana state government's statement.  
  
The company responded to the situation by saying it too had suffered a scam estimating $5 million. But the investors' withdrawal money was delayed even after 6 months passed, and that's how the company was caught red-handed.' According to one of the victims, a fraud had promised everyday returns up to 4% on investments. The people arrested for the theft are accused of money laundering, scam, counterfeit and unlawful connection.

Sadly, it is not the first instance when people have fallen prey to the cryptocurrency scam. "In May, a cryptocurrency fraud gang had was locked down for theft of $200M from over 50,000 victims," reports Hard Fork. Criminals pretended to give crypto-currency grants assuring people 15% of profits for their money. "During the time, the firm had collected about $215M through February 2019, however, police concluded the figure could be around $250M," says Federal Revenue Service.  
  
The police in April caught an individual on doubt that he was running drugs racket gang and stealing money through Bitcoins. In the region Porto Alegre, Southern Brazil, the police officials have discovered a secret drug lab having Bitcoin digging facilities.
