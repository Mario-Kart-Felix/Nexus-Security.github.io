Are you going to try to make all the right choices to become a model citizen sometime before you die? You could marry the love of your life, have children, and get a good education along the way.

Or will you play with the choices that horrify your parents? You could plunge into a life of crime, fall in love or go on an adventure, start prison riots, smuggle sports bags and cheat on your partner. You choose your story ...

Find out how little by little life choices can add up to determine your success in the life of the game.
