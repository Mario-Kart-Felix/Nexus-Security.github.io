In an ongoing effort to keep track of upcoming (and current) Black Friday sales, we've begun highlighting the biggest and best discounts offered by major retailers. Last week we started with [Best Buy](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/07/black-friday-spotlight-best-buy/) and [Target](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/08/black-friday-spotlight-target/), and today we're moving on to Walmart.

[Walmart](https://linksynergy.walmart.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=2149&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2F) is set to host its Black Friday sale beginning online on Wednesday, November 27 at 10 a.m. ET, and then starting in stores Thanksgiving day at 6 p.m. ET. You'll find the usual array of TVs, smart watches, smartphones, tablets, headphones, video games, and much more discounted throughout the event.  
  
  
  
  
  

Apple
-----

  
  
  
This includes Apple devices like the [AirPods with Charging Case](https://linksynergy.walmart.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=2149&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441) **for $129**, down from a regular price of $159. This price undercuts the $134-$144 price of the wireless headphones that will be seen this Black Friday at Best Buy, Target, and Staples.  
  
  
  
  
  
You'll also have a chance to save on the [32GB 10.2-inch iPad](https://linksynergy.walmart.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=2149&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-7th-Gen-Wi-Fi-32GB%2F216119597), **priced at $249**, down from $329, which is the same price seen among the major retailers this season and one of the best all-around deals you can find on Black Friday.  
  
  
  
  
  
Walmart will have the [Apple Watch Series 3 in 38mm](https://linksynergy.walmart.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=2149&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F706203065) **for $129**, down from $199; while the 42mm will be $159, down from $229. These prices will come below Target's sale on the Series 3, and are looking like some of the best discounts on Black Friday for the 2017 Apple Watch.  
  
  
  
  
  
For [iPhones](https://linksynergy.walmart.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=2149&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Fall-iphones%2F0%2F0%2F%3F_refineresult%3Dtrue%26_be_shelf_id%3D7778%26search_sort%3D100%26facet%3Dshelf_id%3A7778%26search_redirect%3Dtrue%26redirectQuery%3Diphone), you'll be able to get **up to $450 in Walmart eGift cards** with qualified activation on iPhone XS ($450), XS Max ($400), XR ($400), 11 ($300), 11 Pro ($300), and 11 Pro Max ($300). If you also trade in an eligible smartphone, you'll get an additional $250 on a Walmart eGift card. The retailer will also have the 32GB iPhone 6s Plus for $149 on Straight Talk or Total Wireless plans.  
  
  
  
  
  

Electronics

Walmart will have a big selection of discounts on various electronics, from audio equipment to smart watches, networking, and more. It should also be a good time to invest in a low-price 4K television if you've been holding out, with prices starting between $148 and $280 for solid options.
