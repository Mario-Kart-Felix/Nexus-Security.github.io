Xiaomi is expected to launch its Black Shark 3 gaming smartphone later this year, and a couple of supposedly-leaked screenshots have seemingly given us our first look at one of its key hardware features. The device is said to ship with a 120Hz panel, and according to new images posted on Chinese micro-blogging site, Weibo, it will offer users the option to manually switch between 60Hz, 90Hz and 120Hz refresh rates as a possible battery-saving feature. The handset will also apparently have an option to lower the display resolution from 2K to 1080p, reveals one of the purported screenshots.

Leaks about the Black Shark 3 have been seeping in ever so steadily over the past several days, and it was only last week that tipster _@Sudhanshu_ claimed the device will be the world’s first Android smartphone to ship with 16GB of RAM. The [latest leak about the Galaxy S20 Ultra](https://beebom.com/galaxy-s20-s20-rear-camera-specs-leaked/), of course, now suggests that the title of the ‘World’s first 16GB Phone’ will very likely go to Samsung’s upcoming flagship, but if Sudhanshu’s assertion does hold up, the Black Shark 3 will certainly be one of the [gaming smartphones to watch out for this year](https://beebom.com/nubia-red-magic-5g-144hz-display-support/).

Not a whole lot is known about the Black Shark 3 at this stage, but it is a safe bet to assume that it will be powered by Qualcomm’s latest premium processor, the [Snapdragon 865](https://beebom.com/snapdragon-865-vs-dimensity-1000/), which was [officially announced](https://beebom.com/qualcomm-announces-new-snapdragon-865-snapdragon-765-chipset/) by the US chip giant last month. The rest of the tech specs remain under wraps for now, but we hope to get more info in the coming days.
