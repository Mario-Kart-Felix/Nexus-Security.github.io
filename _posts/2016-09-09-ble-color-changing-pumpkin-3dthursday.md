> In this video I show you how to take a 3D Printed FAB365 Pumpkin and Adafruit Circuit Playground Bluefruit and using CircuitPython to add the ability to change the color with your smartphone or Apple Watch. This was printed in Prusament Vanilla White PLA at the recommended settings for the model. I used the Jack-o-lantern with the translucent face, but a carved face version is also available.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
