A new guide in the Adafruit Learning System: [BLE Synth with the Feather nRF52840 and Circuit Playground Bluefruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/ble-synth-with-the-feather-nrf52840-and-circuit-playground-bluefruit/overview) by Liz Clark.

> In this project, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is used to have a **Feather nRF52840** and **Circuit Playground Bluefruit** communicate with each other to create a wireless 8-bit music synthesizer. The Feather has 12 buttons attached to its I/O pins. Each time a button is pressed, it sends a BLE packet to the Circuit Playground Bluefruit. When the Circuit Playground Bluefruit receives those packets, it swirls its on-board NeoPixels in a specific color and plays a tone.

This project was inspired by the tone example in the [**Bluefruit Playground App**](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-playground-app). With the app, you may connect your Circuit Playground Bluefruit board to your iOS device and then play with a series of examples, each with a user interface to allowing control of the Circuit Playground Bluefruit sensors.

One of those examples has a piano keyboard in the app and when the keys are pressed, they cause a tone to play from the Circuit Playground Bluefruit. I thought it would be cool to recreate this concept with hardware.
