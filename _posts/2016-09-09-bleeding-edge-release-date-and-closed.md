[Bleeding Edge](https://www.gamespot.com/bleeding-edge/), the upcoming team-based brawler from [Hellblade](https://www.gamespot.com/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/) developer Ninja Theory, will be released on March 24, 2020. At least that's the case according to a Microsoft Store page that mistakingly went live a bit too early today.

The page has since been taken down, but [True Achievements](https://www.trueachievements.com/n39681/bleeding-edge-release-date-closed-beta) managed to spot it and grab all of the relevant details. Prior to the game's release on March 24, the store page notes that there will be two closed betas for Xbox Game Pass members and those who pre-order. The first beta kicks off on February 14, with another following on March 13.

Those who do pre-order or play Bleeding Edge on Xbox Game Pass before March 31 will also gain access to the Punk Pack, which contains three fighter skins for character's Nidhoggr, Buttercup, and Zero Cool. The pack also includes a "Make Your Mark" in-game sticker pack, three bonus taunts, and Rioter's Hoverboard.

Bleeding Edge was originally revealed during Microsoft's [E3 2019 press conference](https://www.gamespot.com/videos/microsoft-e3-2019-full-press-conference/2300-6449844/) earlier this year. The online mechanically-enhanced brawler is an obvious departure from Ninja Theory's previous work, which includes single-player action games like [DmC: Devil May Cry](https://www.gamespot.com/dmc-devil-may-cry/) and [Enslaved: Odyssey to the West](https://www.gamespot.com/enslaved-odyssey-to-the-west/).

[X019](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/x019-inside-xbox-livestream-start-time-and-how-to-/1100-6471272/) kicks off later today, so Bleeding Edge is likely to appear at the show with an official release date announcement. Keep your eyes peeled on GameSpot for all of the news from Microsoft's show.
