With the likes of Alexa and Siri, our devices are spying on us more and more. This bracelet will block microphones from easedropping on you.

Via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/technology/alexa-jamming-bracelet-privacy-armor.html):

> Mr. Zhao and Ms. Zheng are computer science professors at the University of Chicago, and they decided to channel their disagreement into something productive. With the help of an assistant professor, Pedro Lopes, they designed a piece of digital armor: a “[bracelet of silence](http://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/jammer/)” that will jam the Echo or any other microphones in the vicinity from listening in on the wearer’s conversations.

From the [project page](http://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/jammer/) at the University of Chicago:

> We engineered a wearable microphone jammer that is capable of disabling microphones in its user’s surroundings, including hidden microphones. Our device is based on a recent exploit that leverages the fact that when exposed to ultrasonic noise, commodity microphones will leak the noise into the audible range. Moreover, our device exploits a synergy between ultrasonic jamming and the naturally occurring movements that users induce on their wearable devices (e.g., bracelets) as they gesture or walk. We demonstrate that these movements can blur jamming blind spots and increase jamming coverage. Lastly, our wearable bracelet is built in a ring-layout that allows it to jam in multiple directions. This is beneficial in that it allows our jammer to protect against microphones hidden out of sight.
