On [Il blog di Mastro Gippo](http://www.mastrogippo.it/), intern [Michele writes about](http://www.mastrogippo.it/2019/09/board-testing-its-fun-they-said/) building a test bed for a manufactured electronics board.

> After manufacturing the boards, we need to test them to make sure that the assembly house built them correctly. This is my first time designing a nail bed, however the task seems quite simple. I have to test the following:
> 
> *   Short circuits
> *   Voltage levels from the various power supplies
> *   Current consumption
> *   Communication (RS485, I2C, SPI …)
> *   Other signals to and from the board
> 
> It will consist of two pieces: one double-stacked board with pogo pins and clamps to secure the device under test (DUT for short) and another board with all the logic and the supply to do the testing. The logic board will be divided in two parts, one for testing the high voltage side of the DUT, which is attached to the mains power, and another part for the low voltage side.
