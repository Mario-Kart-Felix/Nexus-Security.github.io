Always look forward to this annual feature from [Booooooom](https://www.booooooom.com/2019/12/30/64-photos-by-64-photographers/):

> We featured some incredible photography in 2019 and I had the pleasure of spending this past week paring it all down to a selection of 64 photos by 64 photographers (technically 65, as there’s a duo).

We #celebratephotography here at Adafruit every Saturday. From photographers of all levels to projects you have made or those that inspire you to make, we’re on it! Got a tip? Well, send it in!

If you’re interested in making your own project and need some gear, we’ve got you covered. Be sure to check out our [Raspberry Pi accessories](https://www.adafruit.com/category/105) and our [DIY cameras](https://www.adafruit.com/categories/68).
