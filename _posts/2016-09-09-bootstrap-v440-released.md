### Highlights

Here's what you need to know about v4.4.0. Remember that with every minor and major release of Bootstrap, we ship a new URL for our hosted docs to ensure URLs continue to work.- **New responsive containers!** Over a year in the making, fluid up to a particular breakpoint, available for all responsive tiers.

*   **New responsive `.row-cols` classes** for quickly specifying the number of columns across breakpoints. This one is huge for those of you who have asked for responsive card decks.
*   **New `escape-svg()` function** for simplifying our embedded `background-image` SVGs for forms and more.
*   **New `add()` and `subtract()` functions** for avoiding errors and zero values from CSS's built in `calc` feature.
*   **New `make-col-auto()` mixin** to make our `.col-auto` class available with custom HTML.
*   Fixed an issue with Microsoft Edge not picking up `:disabled` styles by moving selectors to `[disabled]`.
*   **Deprecated:** `bg-variant()`, `nav-divider()`, and `form-control-focus()` mixins are now deprecated as they're going away in v5.
*   Updated our spacing and alignment for modal footer elements like buttons to automatically wrap when space is constrained.
*   More flexible form control validation styles thanks to fewer chained selectors. Also updated the `:invalid` validation icon to be an alert instead of an `×` to avoid confusion with browser functionality for clearing the form field value.
*   Fixed a couple dozen CSS and JS bugs.
*   Moved to GitHub Actions for CI/CD! Expect more updates to our CI setup over time here while Actions evolves.
*   Updated documentation to fix links and typos, improved landmarks for secondary navigation, and a new security doc for guidelines on reporting potential vulnerabilities.
