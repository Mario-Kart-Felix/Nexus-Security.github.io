[Lucian Copeland](https://twitter.com/hierophect) is hosting a [CircuitPython meetup](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/circuitpython-meetup-tickets-92395985881) on February 12th at 5-7pm at the [Artisan’s Asylum makerspace](https://twitter.com/artisansasylum) in Somerville, MA (greater Boston, USA). Attendees of any level of experience are welcome, from first time hobbyists to CircuitPython core contributors. Visitors who bring their physical projects are also encouraged to transition to the Artisan’s Asylum Circuit Hacking night from 6:30-8pm for advice on PCBs and physical components.

[CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) is a programming language designed to simplify experimenting and learning to program on low-cost microcontroller boards. It makes getting started easier than ever with no upfront desktop downloads needed. Once you get your board set up, open any text editor, and get started editing code. It’s that simple.

Artisan’s Asylum is a 501(c)3 non-profit community fabrication center, the second largest makerspace in the US at just shy of 40,000 square feet and over 300 active members.
