It's difficult to describe what's happening in this astounding ass Unity demo [by game design student Matt Stark](https://twitter.com/mattstark256/), but I'll go ahead and try: He's created an interactive world where the user seems to take a "Polaroid photo" of the surroundings -- and once taken, the photo _becomes_ its own little interactive, manipulable world.

As you might expect, Mark tells me he created this effect for a puzzle game he's working on. "I think the puzzles could be open-ended, allowing the player to approach them creatively," he tells me. "I'm at the stage of brainstorming level mechanics and trying to decide what the anatomy of a puzzle in the game should be." 

As for achieving this effect, here's how he does it:

"When the player takes a photo I duplicate the environment, make it greyscale and slice the meshes to remove anything outside the photo. When they place it into the world I slice the environment's meshes to make a hole for the photo." 

Or to put it another way, he puts a copy of the world on top of the world, and erases anything that would cause those worlds to overlap, until they're ready to do so. (If you know what I mean, and I'm not even sure I do.)

Matt says he may publicly release the code at some point. Metaphysicians are standing by.
