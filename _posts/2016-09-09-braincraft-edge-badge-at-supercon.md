Here are some of the details about the BrainCraft EDGE BADGE that is at [Supercon](https://hackaday.io/superconference/) this year brought to you by [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/) and Adafruit!

Machine learning has come to the ‘edge’ – small microcontrollers that can run a very miniature version of TensorFlow Lite to do ML computations. But you don’t need super complex hardware to start developing your own TensorFlow models! We’ve curated a simple kit to dip your toes into machine learning waters.

This Supercon badge can also be a name badge that is programmed with CircuitPython, it shows up as USB drive, no IDE needed! Displays name, QR codes, and more!

Supercon attendees receive:

*   Adafruit BrainCraft EDGE BADGE with SAMD51 Cortex M4F processor @ 120MHz, with display, speaker and buttons.
*   Lithium Ion Polymer Battery with Short Cable – 3.7V 350mAh, double sided tape, and lanyard!

The kit uses our BrainCraft EDGE BADGE as your edge processor. It’s a compact board – it’s credit card sized. It’s powered by one of our favorite chip, the ATSAMD51, with 512KB of flash and 192KB of RAM. We add 2 MB of QSPI flash for file storage, handy for TensorFlow Lite files, images, fonts, sounds, or other assets.

Comes with built in microphone input for micro speech recognition. Our Arduino library has some demos you can get started with to recognize various word pairs like “yes/no”, “up/down” and “cat/dog” and other voice demos. Also includes gesture recognition, and more!

TensorFlow Lite for microcontrollers is very cutting-edge so expect to see a lot of development happening in this area, with lots of code and process changes.

*   ATSAMD51J19 @ 120MHz with 3.3V logic/power – 512KB of FLASH + 192KB of RAM
*   2 MB of SPI Flash for storing images, sounds, animations, whatever!
*   1.8″ 160×128 Color TFT Display connected to its own SPI port
*   8 x Game/Control Buttons with nice silicone button tops (these feel great)
*   5 x NeoPixels for badge dazzle, or game score-keeping
*   Triple-axis accelerometer (motion sensor)
*   Light sensor, reverse-mount so that it points out the front
*   Built in buzzer mini-speaker
*   Mono Class-D speaker driver for 4-8 ohm speakers, up to 2 Watts
*   LiPoly battery port with built in recharging capability
*   USB port for battery charging, programming and debugging
*   Two female header strips with Feather-compatible pinout so you can plug any FeatherWings in
*   JST ports for NeoPixels, sensor input, and I2C (you can fit I2C Grove connectors in here)
*   Built in microphone.
*   Reset button
*   On-Off switch
