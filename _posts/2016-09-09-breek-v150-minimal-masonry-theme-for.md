[Jussi’s electronics projects](http://jussikilpelainen.kapsi.fi/) sells the Arduino core memory shield on [Tindie as a kit](https://www.tindie.com/products/kilpelaj/core-memory-shield-for-arduino/). It includes complete documentation and source code and is a neat piece of hardware harkening back to vintage days of the 1950s to the 1970s.

Wouldn’t it be cool if you could actually see which bits in the memory were a 1 vs a 0?

Andy Geppert posts [on Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/163976-interactive-core-memory-shield-using-led-matrix) a project that does visualize the memory state!

> This project started as an exploration of “what if…” and lead to the creation this proof-of-concept when I bought one of Jussi Kilpelainen’s 32-bit Core Memory Shields for an Arduino. I found an [Adafruit NeoPixel FeatherWing LED display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2945) was a pretty close fit with the 4×8 core array, and 3D printed a “light guide” to backlight the cores and show the state of each core.

Check out the [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/UCGXGNEb9kc) below to see an updated demo showing how to interact directly with the screen RAM in real-time with a magnet.
