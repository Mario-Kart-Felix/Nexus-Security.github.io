**_Unix: A History and a Memoir_**. Since its creation in a Bell Labs attic in 1969, the Unix operating system has spread far beyond anything its creators could have imagined. It has led to the development of a great deal of innovative software, influenced myriad programmers, and changed the path of computer technology.

This book is part history and part memoir. It tells the story of the origin of Unix, explaining what Unix is, how it came about, and why it matters. Accessible to non-speciaists, the book is written for anyone with an interest in computing or the history of inventions.

Published by Kindle Direct Publishing, October 2019. Available at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1695978552).

**_Millions, Billions, Zillions: Defending Yourself in a World of Too Many Numbers_**. With examples drawn from a rich variety of sources, including journalism, advertising, and politics, the book demonstrates how numbers can mislead and misrepresent. In chapters covering big numbers, units, dimensions, and more, it lays bare everything from deceptive graphs to speciously precise numbers, and shows how anyone -- using a few basic ideas and lots of shortcuts -- can easily learn to recognize common mistakes, determine whether numbers are credible, and make their own sensible estimates when needed. An essential survival guide for a world drowning in big -- and often bad -- data.
