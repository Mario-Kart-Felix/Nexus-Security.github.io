Bright Wearables bags and backpacks contain a colorful circle of light that you control with code, works with micro:bit, and we wanted to make sure it worked with the upcoming board, CLUE ([video](https://youtu.be/dx3qUkAB1ok)).

One cool thing with CLUE is kids could drag and drop any image they want, like a Powerpuff girl to the USB drive that shows up when you use a CLUE. CircuitPython works with Bright Wearables!
