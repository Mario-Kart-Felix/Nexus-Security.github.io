BritBox has launched in the UK. BritBox is a streaming service which (as the name suggests) is focused on British television. This helps to differentiate it from the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, which mostly stream American TV shows.

In March 2017, [BritBox launched in the US](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/stream-british-tv-using-britbox/). This meant that expats and Anglophiles alike could streaming British TV shows to their hearts’ content. However, while viewers in the US have been enjoying BritBox for some time, it’s only now arriving in the UK.

Everything You Need to Know About BritBox
-----------------------------------------

BritBox is now available in the UK. It’s priced at £5.99/month ($8/month). This buys you HD video playback and multi-screen viewing. BritBox offers viewers a chance to watch both old and new shows, but classic British TV makes up the bulk of the BritBox catalog.

BritBox was created by the BBC and ITV, both of which are providing programming for the streaming service. However, thanks to partnership deals with other broadcasters, BritBox will also provide content from Channel 4, Channel 5, and Comedy Central UK.

BritBox [claims](https://www.itv.com/presscentre/britbox/press-releases/brand-new-uk-streaming-service-britbox-open-business-partnerships-struck-channel-4-bt) to have “the biggest collection of British box-sets available in one place.” The service features thousands of hours of programming, including “all 627 available episodes of Classic Doctor Who, originally broadcast between 1963 and 1989.”

Other shows available at launch include Downton Abbey, Gavin & Stacey, Wolf Hall, Love Island, Broadchurch, Only Fools and Horses, Extras, Miss Marple, and Poirot. BritBox is also producing its own shows, starting with a drama called Lambs Of God.

BritBox Is Perfect for Fans of British TV
-----------------------------------------

This is a solid option for Brits keen to watch classic British TV. Sure, some of the shows are already available on other streaming services, but if you generally enjoy watching British shows more than shows produced elsewhere, BritBox has you covered.

While UK residents now have a streaming service entirely focused on homegrown content, Americans already have two such services competing for their money. Thankfully, we’ve previously pitted [Britbox versus Acorn TV](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/britbox-vs-acorn-british-tv/) to help our readers know which is best.
