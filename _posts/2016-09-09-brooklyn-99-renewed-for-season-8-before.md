The hit cop comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine has been renewed for an eighth season. Having been extremely close to never getting past Season 5, following Fox's cancellation in May 2018, the show has found a [new lease on life at NBC](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/brooklyn-nine-nine-saved-by-nbc-after-being-cancel/1100-6458880/). The Season 8 renewal comes before ahead of the Season 7 premiere next February.

The early renewal was revealed in a video tweeted by the official Brooklyn Nine-Nine account. In the video, an NBC exec tells the cast and crew of the show that she wants to dispel "crazy rumors about the next season," and that NBC "wants you to come back." The room then erupts with cheers--check it out below.

Brooklyn Nine-Nine Season 7 premieres on February 6, 2020, so don't expect to see Season 8 until the following year. But this is great news for fans, as it was only 18 months ago that the show was cancelled by Fox after failing to find a [substantial audience](https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&jsonp=vglnk_157375684143911&key=54097c7e8593d23afad397e432d879de&libId=k2z1mj4u0102qieo000DAbqugg6af&loc=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/brooklyn-nine-nine-saved-by-nbc-after-being-cancel/1100-6458880/&v=1&opt=true&out=http://deadline.com/2018/05/brooklyn-nine-nine-canceled-andy-samberg-andre-bruagher-fox-1202380877/&ref=https://www.google.com/&title=Brooklyn Nine-Nine Saved By NBC After Being Canceled - GameSpot&txt=According to Deadline). Shortly after, it was picked up by NBC, which made sense given the show is produced by Universal Television, a branch of NBC itself. As [The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/brooklyn-nine-nine-renewed-season-8-nbc-1254814) states, the show has proved popular for NBC, especially on digital platforms, where it is network's most-watched series.

Brooklyn Nine-Nine stars Andy Samberg, Andre Braugher, Terry Crews, Melissa Fumero, Stephanie Beatriz, Joe Lo Truglio, Dirk Blocker, and Joel McKinnon Miller. It was created by Michael Schur and Dan Goor and first premiered in September 2013.
