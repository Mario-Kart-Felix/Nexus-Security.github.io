> Btlejack provides everything you need to sniff, jam and hijack Bluetooth Low Energy devices. It relies on one or more BBC Micro:Bit. devices running a dedicated firmware. You may also want to use an Adafruit’s Bluefruit LE sniffer or a nRF51822 Eval Kit, as we added support for these devices.
> 
> Current version of this tool (2.0) supports BLE 4.x and 5.x. The BLE 5.x support is limited, as it does only support the 1Mbps Uncoded PHY and does not support channel map updates.
