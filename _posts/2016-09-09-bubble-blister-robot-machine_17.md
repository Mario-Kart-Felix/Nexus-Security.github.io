> Hi makers,
> 
> After a long break, we’re back together. This season we decided to expand our circle a little more. Until now, we have been trying to produce professional projects. high-level information needed to know. But we also thought we should do something for our children. Therefore, some of our projects will be for them.
> 
> Completely designed on simple materials. It will be for educational purposes and then for entertainment purposes. The plastic materials used were printed with 3D printer. Therefore, the cost will be very low. Only motors, batteries and cables will be used.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
