> Don’t invite [Jan Hakon Erichsen](http://www.janhakon.com/) to your next birthday party. The Norwegian artist is on a mission to destroy every balloon he encounters with an endless array of awkward Rube Goldberg-esque setups. Erichsen documents his inventions in “Destruction Diary” videos, which he posts daily on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/janerichsen/), and aggregates into compilations on YouTube. Erichsen’s usual balloon-popping tool of choice is a steak knife, but he has also employed bananas, cacti, and [saws](https://www.instagram.com/p/B1Lg0RhByr5/) to do the deed. The artist explains in a statement that he “works within a variety of media focusing on topics like fear, anger and frustration”. In addition to his balloon-centric video work, Erichson explores other found materials in his structural D.I.Y. projects, which you can see on his [website](http://www.janhakon.com/).
