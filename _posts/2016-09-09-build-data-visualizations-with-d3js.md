Learn how to use D3 (v5) & Firebase (Firestore) to create dynamic SVG data visualizations. Bar charts, pie charts.  
**What you’ll learn**  

*   Learn D3 JS & Firebase (Firestore) from the ground up
*   Create data-driven visualizations (graphs, charts, diagrams) with D3 JS
*   Store (and retrieve) data in a real-time database called Firestore (from Firebase)
*   Updata data visualizations in real-time with Firestore
*   Create 3 projects with D3 and Firebase (Firestore)

**Requirements**  

*   A basic to moderate level of JavaScript
*   A basic to moderate level of HTML
*   A basic to moderate level of CSS

**Description**  
Learn how to create great-looking data visualizations with D3.js  
D3.js is a powerful JavaScript library used to create data visualizations easily. In this course I’ll teach you how to harness the power of D3 to create a variety of different data-driven visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, line graphs,  bubble packs and tree diagrams.  
  
We’ll learn about D3 select, changing SVG attributes & styles, scales, axes, transitions, hierarchial data and much more…  
  
Use Firebase Firestore to update your D3.js diagrams in real-time  
  
I’ll also teach you how to use Firestore (from Google Firebase) – a real-time NoSQL database in which we can store our data. We’ll use this to power our D3.js visualizations in real-time (without updating the browser) and to make them interactive, fun & dynamic.  
  
We’ll also be creating 3 projects to put our D3 & Firebase skills to the test – first of all a money planner called Ninja Wonga, then a fitness tracker called The Dojo and finally a company employee tree diagram called Ninja Corp.  
  
…Why all the ninjas?
