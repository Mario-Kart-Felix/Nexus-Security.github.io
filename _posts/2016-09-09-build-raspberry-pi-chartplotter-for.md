> Earlier this year, James Conger built a chartplotter for his boat using a Raspberry Pi…The entire build cost approximately $350. It incorporates a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, [dAISy AIS receiver HAT](https://shop.wegmatt.com/products/daisy-hat-ais-receiver), USB GPS module, and touchscreen display, all hooked up to his boat.
> 
> Perfect for navigating the often foggy San Francisco Bay, the chartplotter allows James to track the position, speed, and direction of major vessels in the area, superimposed over high-quality NOAA nautical charts.
