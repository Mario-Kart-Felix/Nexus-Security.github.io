Have you noticed how much Amazon prices seem to fluctuate? Never miss out on the low cost deals with this project from [Devscover](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7jBsNZf-wRyJkEmDKBrg2A) on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/SyW6YK7ftis). The easy to follow video walks through writing the code in Python.

Via [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/build-a-raspberry-pi-zero-w-amazon-price-tracker/):

> By following their video tutorial, you can set up a notification system on Raspberry Pi Zero W that emails you every time your chosen item’s price drops. Very nice.
> 
> Devscover’s tutorial is so detailed that it seems a waste to try and summarise it here. So instead, why not make yourself a cup of tea and sit down with the video? It’s worth the time investment: if you follow the instructions, you’ll end up with a great piece of tech that’ll save you money!
