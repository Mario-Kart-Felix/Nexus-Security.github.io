Coding is great, but it’s not everything! That’s why we will go through the entire process of building and launching our website project. This includes designing, coding, planning, writing clean and organized code, website optimization, best practices, and so much more.  
Designing is really, really important. Have you seen all these beautiful and modern websites lately? Great! And not just in theory, but also in practice. This is the only course on the market that focuses on both coding and designing, together.
