Using a 3D printer to make high quality parts is a great way to improve the look and appeal of any project. If you want to replicate something exactly, though, you’ll need either a very good set of calipers and a lot of time or a 3D scanner. Using the 3D scanner and the 3D printer go along very well together, [especially if you use your 3D printer to build your 3D scanner too](http://www.revolutionscan.com/rpi_scanner_v2/).

This project comes to us from \[Vojislav\] who spent the past two years perfecting this 3D scanner. Using a vast array of 3D printed parts, this build looks professional on every level. It also boasts a Raspberry Pi Zero and a fleet of camera modules, not to mention its own LED lighting. \[Vojislav\] has provided the printer files and the software needed to run it on the project page. It all runs through command line and python code, but that shouldn’t be a big hurdle.

While there is no video of it in action, it seems like all the parts are there for a solid 3D scanner, provided you have access to a 3D printer that can churn out the parts you’ll need. If you need something larger, there are some other options available as well that [really take your photogrammetry skills to the next level](https://hackaday.com/2019/04/27/this-3d-scanner-is-your-ticket-to-photogrammetry/).
