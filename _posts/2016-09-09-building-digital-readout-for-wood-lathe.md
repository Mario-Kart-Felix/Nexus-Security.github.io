Zach Hipps is an electrical engineer. He recently decided to take up woodworking and using a woodturning lathe. Things are a bit too cold in his shop at the moment, so he turned his attention to building a digital readout for his Delta lathe using an Arduino Nano, a 3D-printed enclosure and sensor ring, and a [Hall effect sensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect).

It’s interesting to watch his iterative process in designing the readout and overcoming issues with the sensor readings and magnet distribution. He may not be done on this readout just yet. As an experienced turner points out on [his website](https://www.bytesizedengineering.com/projects/wood-lathe-digital-readout), he’ll need to have that hand wheel freely accessible every time he sets up a new project so he’d be better served setting the sensor up on the spindle end of the headstock.
