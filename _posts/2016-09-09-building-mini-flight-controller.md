Dyanko Chernev on the [ExRockets Blog posts](http://www.blog.exrockets.com/blog/mini-flight-recorder/) about making a mini flight controller.

> For a while a wanted to make my own flight recorder similar to the commercial altimeters but with my own requirements for functionality. In addition it needed to be visually appealing and functional in the same time … After some thinking about the design and functionality the idea for the MINI FLIGHT RECORDER was developed in my mind and I set myself to work.
> 
> The new MINI FLIGHT RECORDER has the following functionality:
> 
> – Barometric/Altimeter sensor MPL3115A2  
> – Built in temperature sensor  
> – 3D High g accelerometer ADXL375  
> – 128×32 OLED graphic display  
> – 2MB built-in memory  
> – 820 seconds recording time from all sensors  
> – 40 SPS (25 msec between data points)  
> – Built-in LIPO battery  
> – Battery level indication  
> – Built-in USB LIPO charger  
> – USB port  
> – Size 38x12x12mm (including battery)  
> – Weight 5.6gr (including battery)  
> – USB bootloader – Firmware update through the USB

The post solicits testers:

> _\*\*\* Currently I don’t have the possibility to launch rockets therefore I plan to assemble about 10 units and give them away to help with testing and developing. This is to say I will send you a flight recorder and in return whenever you can fit it in your rockets it would be very helpful for me to have the flight logs so I can finish and test the remaining functionality. Also would be good if you can report any bugs that you notice so I can fix them and issue a new firmware (and/or software) revision which you can flash in the MFR using the USB interface._
