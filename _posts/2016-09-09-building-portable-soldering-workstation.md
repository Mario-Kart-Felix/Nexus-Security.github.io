On [this episode](https://youtu.be/8uGS11yuVyo) of Adam Savage’s “One Day Builds,” he does what he calls a infrastructure build. In it, he addresses a problem he has in quickly setting up his multipurpose workbench for electronics work/soldering. He decides to make a portable carrier (think: a nerdy version of a shoeshine kit) to house a battery-powered USB iron and all of the basic tools and supplies needed for soldering.

Besides the soldering station build itself, it’s educational to see how Adam goes about thinking through his problem and coming up with a solution. In this particular instance, he doesn’t have a fully-realized plan. He iterates his way through until he ends up with a solution that he’s happy with.
