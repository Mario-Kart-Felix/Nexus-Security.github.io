> Based on LeoDuhVinci’s Model: https://ift.tt/389ZCa7  
> Only change i made is to add vent to the drain hole (which is on a flat bottom on his model, and has difficulty draining if placed on a flat surface) to the sides of the model.
> 
> If your temp is correct for your filament and your bridging is good, this needs no supports.  
> I printed at .06 layer height or less for a smooth finish.

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!

The [Adafruit Learning System](http://learn.adafruit.com) has dozens of great tools to get you well on your way to creating incredible works of engineering, interactive art, and design with your 3D printer! If you’ve made a cool project that combines 3D printing and electronics, be sure to let us know, and we’ll [feature](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) it here!
