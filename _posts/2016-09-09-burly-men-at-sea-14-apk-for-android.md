Burly Men at Sea is a folk tale featuring a trio of bearded and well-built fishermen who leave their ordinary lives to go on an adventure.

The scenario of the game, which takes place in Scandinavia at the beginning of the twentieth century, branched out according to encounters with folk creatures. You play the storyteller who shapes the story around the three unbalanced heroes. Play a first time to discover a unique story, then go back to the sea for new adventures.

A BROKEN SCENARIO: Play multiple adventures, each designed to be completed in one go.
