Large business representatives proposed a scheme to legalise eSIM in Russia. Innovative virtual SIM cards will be available to Russians next year.  
  
In addition, Russia began work on the creation of remote identification of mobile subscribers by face and voice. This will speed up the implementation of virtual SIM cards (eSIM), which are now being tested by Russian operators. When the system works, it will be possible to register on the network by taking a picture on a computer or phone camera and saying a few words into the microphone. People donâ€™t have to come to the office of a mobile operator with a passport.  
  
eSIM is a module built into the mobile device that allows people to change the tariff and the mobile company without buying and replacing a physical SIM card. People can get a new connection by scanning, for example, a QR code in the operator's personal account.  
  
Deputy Prime Minister Maxim Akimov in early September in an interview on the timing of the implementation of virtual SIM-cards in Russia said: "We will do for sure."  
  
After all, the SIM card is also a small chip. If this chip is a combination of algorithms that can be built into the phone, why it is needed separately, said the Deputy Prime Minister.  
  
Last week, Tele2 resumed eSIM test connections in several of its stores. According to the representative of the mobile operator MegaFon, the company is worried about how to ensure the security of Russian data when using eSIM.  
  
The introduction of eSIM can lead to serious changes in the Russian mobile market, said Konstantin Ankilov, CEO of TMT Consulting.  
  
The use of eSIM will have a positive impact on the Telecom market, as it will lead to the development of competition and, as a result, improve user service, believes the representative of Tele2.  
  
It is interesting to note that since the end of 2018, eSIM technology has been working in the US and European countries. Now there are more than 40 eSIM-supporting operators in the world. The technology is available in new Apple smartphones, Google Pixel devices, Samsung and Apple smartwatches, and iPad tablets
