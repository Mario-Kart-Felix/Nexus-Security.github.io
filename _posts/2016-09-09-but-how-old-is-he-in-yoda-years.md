> There’s a big, if unintentional, consequence of [Baby Yoda’s](https://io9.gizmodo.com/star-wars-babies-ranked-1840071498) existence. Because we were told how old the little guy is (50) and we think we have a decent understanding of how old [Baby Yoda](https://io9.gizmodo.com/of-course-theres-a-14-month-waitlist-for-this-300-unof-1840387764?_ga=2.43796134.280511670.1577137109-1751557175.1567029747) is developmentally (approximately 18 months) considering what we’ve seen of his actions so far in [_The Mandalorian_](https://io9.gizmodo.com/things-take-a-dramatic-turn-for-baby-yoda-in-the-mandal-1840491925?_ga=2.250364421.280511670.1577137109-1751557175.1567029747), we can infer how old Master Yoda was when he pulled his disappearing act on Luke in _Return of the Jedi_. If our theory is correct, Jedi Master was so young he probably didn’t even have a 401k.

> When Yoda passes in _Return of the Jedi_ we know he’s around 900 years old. He’s aged visibly from _Revenge of the Sith_ set over 18 years before that. Because we see that he ages over the course of nearly 20 years, we can make one major assumption about his species (which is not named in _Star Wars_ canon and will be referred to simply as Yoda for the purposes of this blog)—they continue to age over time and do so in clear visible ways. This means it has senescence—a term referring to creatures (including humans) that mature and age after reaching maturity. This also means Yodas likely do not possess [negligible senescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligible_senescence)—a trait shared by many turtles and lobsters. Those species age so slowly it is difficult to perceive biologically speaking.
