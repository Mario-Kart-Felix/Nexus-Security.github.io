Last week Adafruit launched **Buy One Give One** with [Black Girls CODE](http://blackgirlscode.org/), and it was over in just a couple hours! The goal was hit, now we’re back with more – and with [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/)! We’re doing this again, and thanks to [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/) we have added 100 more Circuit Playground Express units!

For a limited time, whenever you buy a Circuit Playground Express at the regular price of $24.95, [on this page](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2599), Adafruit will automatically donate one to [Black Girls CODE](http://blackgirlscode.org/)! The goal of [Black Girls CODE](http://blackgirlscode.org/) is to empower young women of color ages 7-17 to embrace the current tech marketplace as builders + creators.

[Black Girls CODE](http://blackgirlscode.org/) vision is to increase the number of women of color in the digital space by empowering girls of color ages 7 to 17 to become innovators in STEM fields, leaders in their communities, and builders of their own futures through exposure to computer science and technology. To provide African-American youth with the skills to occupy some of the 1.4 million computing job openings expected to be available in the U.S. by 2020, and to train 1 million girls by 2040.  
Special thanks to Digi-Key for this round of sponsorship!
