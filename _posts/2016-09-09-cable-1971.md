**Cable 1971**, otherwise known as **Priority Signal** or **File 1971** was a high profile and secret [military signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signals_intelligence "Signals intelligence") communicated between the two main [inter-services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_Pakistan "Military of Pakistan") branches of Pakistan–the [Pakistan Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Army "Pakistan Army") and the [Pakistan Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Navy "Pakistan Navy").[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_1971#cite_note-PakDef_Military_Consortium-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_1971#cite_note-Lancer_Publishers,_Roy-2):219 The [military cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_signals "Military signals") was directed through the [Naval Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Intelligence_(Pakistan) "Naval Intelligence (Pakistan)") and [Military Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Intelligence_(Pakistan) "Military Intelligence (Pakistan)") to [ISI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Intelligence "Inter-Services Intelligence") sent on December 1952 to its [headquarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Intelligence#Headquarters "Inter-Services Intelligence").[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_1971#cite_note-PakDef_Military_Consortium-1)

The [cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_communications "Military communications") came in the wake of reactionary of [Basic Principles Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Principles_Committee "Basic Principles Committee")'s first report towards the writing of the [first set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Pakistan_of_1956 "Constitution of Pakistan of 1956") of the [Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Pakistan "Constitution of Pakistan") of [Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan "Pakistan").[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_1971#cite_note-PakDef_Military_Consortium-1) The cable was sent by then-[Commodore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_(rank) "Commodore (rank)") [S.M. Ahsan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syed_Mohammad_Ahsan "Syed Mohammad Ahsan") to [DG ISI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_General_of_Inter-Services_Intelligence "Director General of Inter-Services Intelligence") [Major-General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major-General "Major-General") [R. Cawthome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cawthome "Robert Cawthome") on a file coincidentally numbered 1971.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_1971#cite_note-PakDef_Military_Consortium-1) The cable discussed the implication of [One Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Unit "One Unit"), [religious fanaticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_discrimination_in_Pakistan "Religious discrimination in Pakistan"), and the economic parity between the [West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Pakistan "West Pakistan") and [East Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Pakistan "East Pakistan") that will ultimately result in the division of Pakistan into two different groups.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_1971#cite_note-Lancer_Publishers,_Roy-2):219–220

The Cable's message read as:

*   The creation of Committee of Ulema to veto the decisions taken in the House of People on religious matters, gives excess of powers to Ulema over the rights of elected representatives of the people. This gives an impression of Pakistan as being a Theocratic State.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_1971#cite_note-Lancer_Publishers,_Roy-2):219–220
*   To recommend that the head of the state should be a Muslim will unnecessarily create suspicions in minds of the minorities in Pakistan. The choice to select the head of the state should be left entirely to the people, to select without prejudice to caste, colour and creed.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_1971#cite_note-Lancer_Publishers,_Roy-2):219–220
*   It is maintained by same officers that a single House elected on population basis should have been envisaged, and we should cease to think in terms of Bengalis and Punjabis etc. The parity between West & East Pakistan will ultimately result in the division of Pakistan into two different groups, therefore, it is the very negation of one people, one country and one culture.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_1971#cite_note-PakDef_Military_Consortium-1)

The cable's message was further extended and discussed at the [Army GHQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHQ_(Pakistan_Army) "GHQ (Pakistan Army)") by MI's officer Major [KM Arif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalid_Mahmud_Arif "Khalid Mahmud Arif") when he compiled an "Intelligence Report No. 7894 of the Office of Intelligence Research and Analysis" in December 1970.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_1971#cite_note-PakDef_Military_Consortium-1)

The cable is notable for its [highlighted title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headline "Headline") and many historians found strange that the cable was coincidentally numbered: **Cable/File 1971**.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_1971#cite_note-PakDef_Military_Consortium-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_1971#cite_note-Lancer_Publishers,_Roy-2):210
