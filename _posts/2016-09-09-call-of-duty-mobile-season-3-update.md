Having launched with much fanfare last year, [Call of Duty: Mobile](https://beebom.com/call-of-duty-mobile-crosses-170-million-downloads/) is all set to roll out its Season 3 around the middle of January, bringing new modes, new maps, a new ranked mode season for both [battle royale](https://beebom.com/best-upcoming-battle-royale-games/) and multiplayer, a new Battle Pass and more. According to an official community update on Reddit, Activision said that in the new season, the game will get a new **‘Rapid Fire’ mode for multiplayer** and a new **multiplayer map called ‘Scrapyard’** recreated from the classic three-lane Modern Warfare 2 map.  

Details about the map are yet to be officially announced, but Activision says it will be _“a medium sized map that provides plenty of opportunities for close to mid-range combat and promises plenty of action”_. As for the Rapid Fire mode, Activision says it will be a _“fast paced and action-packed experience”_ that will offer gamers _“infinite ammo, infinite grenades, sped up operator skill cooldowns, and faster recharging scorestreaks”_.

In addition to that, Activision will roll out a mixture of BR and Multiplayer challenges to give gamers opportunities to get more gear. The new challenges include a Prop Hunt mode and a BR Sniper Challenge mode, both of which started on January 1st and will be available until the 15th of this month. Others, like the MQ-27 Dragonfire, a combat drone from Black Ops 2, will last from January 3rd to 12th. There’s also a Stick & Stones mode that goes live today and will be available till 15th of January.  

Finally, Activision also says that the incoming update will add a number of new survey topics, as well as fix several bugs, including an annoying issue that renders certain features of the [DualShock 4 Wireless Controllers](https://beebom.com/stadia-dualshock-4-xbox-one-controller-compatibility/) unusable on Android 9 and 10.
