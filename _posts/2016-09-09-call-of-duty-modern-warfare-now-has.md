[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare](https://www.gamespot.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare/) released on October 25, meaning that some players have had a chance to put serious time into multiplayer and [unlock Officer ranks](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-call-of-duty-modern-warfares-multiplayer/1100-6470686/). Officer ranks replace the prestige system from past games in the Call of Duty series, and allow you to chase a new XP target every season, unlocking new Seasonal Ribbons, Season Emblems, and Weapon Blueprints as you move between the 100 ranks available. Players are now be able to gain XP faster in Officer ranks by completing seasonal trials, now available on the main multiplayer screen.

Developer Infinity Ward has announced that Trials have officially come to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, describing how they work on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/doxypf/earn_xp_rewards_in_trials_now_live_in_modern/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). Once you level up enough to hit Officer ranks you'll start to earn tickets, which can be spent on Trials. One ticket grants you three attempts at one Trial, and you'll be judged on your performance at completion with a star rating between zero and three stars. Tickets unlock as you level up, but they also reset when the season ends, so it's best to use them as you earn them rather than hoarding.

For a zero star performance in a Trial, you'll get 0XP. One star nets you 5000 XP, two stars gets you 7500 XP, and three stars earns 10,000XP. Performing well in Trials will help you climb up the Officer ranks faster and earn more rewards each season.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is also [getting a battle pass](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-battle-pass-coming-nex/1100-6471285/) next month in lieu of a season pass, which will let you unlock new items by completing additional challenges. Infinity Ward is working hard: the 725 shotgun has received [a few updates in patches already](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-update-will-tweak-the-/1100-6471339/), while the game has also received [new maps and modes](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-maps-mode-arrives-/1100-6471279/) since launch.
