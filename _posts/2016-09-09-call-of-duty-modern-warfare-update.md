Developer Infinity Ward has released a new [Call of Duty: Modern Warfare](https://www.gamespot.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare/) update that addresses several issues relating to stability and playability, including adjusting [the bugged double-barreled 725 shotgun](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/some-of-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-guns-are-bugge/1100-6471141/). The full patch notes can be viewed below.

According to [a Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/dv5h1d/111219_update_details_and_patch_notes/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), this new Modern Warfare patch is now live for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. While the headlining feature is a slight change to the 725 shotgun, the patch takes aim at preventing crashes across all modes and platforms, modifying the directional sound and speed of footsteps, fixing Mission Challenge descriptions, and more.

A variety of weapons have been altered in this newly-released Modern Warfare patch. The 725 shotgun, [capable of shooting and killing from across the map](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-update-will-change-the/1100-6471339/), has had its range reduced. Alongside the 725, the hip spread of assault rifles has been adjusted, the M4 has had its head damage decreased, and both the EB-14 and FAL saw an increase in their aiming down sights (ADS) speed.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare has seen a few patches since its October 25 launch on consoles and PC. Apart from this new patch, Infinity Ward released [its biggest update to the Modern Warfare reboot](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-update-107-out-now-her/1100-6471303/) to date. The free 1.07 update added new content in the form of maps and an additional game mode, addressed some of the community's most-pressing complaints, and more.
