Original release date: November 29, 2019  

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is aware of a phone scam where a caller pretends to be a CISA Service Desk representative. The scammer, whose spoofed call appears to be from CISA’s [toll free number](https://www.cisa.gov/contact-us), claims to have knowledge of the potential victim’s questionable behavior and attempts to extort money.

If you receive a threatening call from someone claiming to be a CISA representative, CISA recommends the following actions:

*   Do not respond or try to contact the caller.
*   Do not pay the caller.
*   Contact your [local FBI field office](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/field-offices) to file a report.
