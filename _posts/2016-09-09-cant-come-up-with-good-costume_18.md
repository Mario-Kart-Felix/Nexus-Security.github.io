Janelle Shane announces her 2019 line of AI-generated costumes.

Haloween is right around the corner, do you have a costume yet? Are you looking for something fun and VERY unique? Then Janelle Shane (@JanelleCShane) [has the costume for you](https://aiweirdness.com/post/188342947482/halloween-costumes-by-the-neural-net-gpt-2).  For the last three years, Shane has used various machine learning algorithms to come up with some pretty memorable costume ideas. In [2017](https://aiweirdness.com/post/166814009412/a-neural-network-designs-halloween-costumes), it was the char-rnn neural network that learns words ‘from scratch, letter by letter’. The char-rnn costumes were a bit [weird](https://twitter.com/JanelleCShane/status/1183786194175438850) including “Grankenstein”, “Scorbs Monster” and “Sexy Avical Ster of a balana Aly” but fun nonetheless.

> In 2017 I tried to generate Halloween costumes with a neural net that didn’t have any prior knowledge of English words. Its costumes often made no damn sense.

In [2018](https://twitter.com/JanelleCShane/status/1183791523701370883), Shane teamed up with the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/26/opinion/halloween-spooky-costumes-machine-learning-generator.html) (NYT) to create some more ‘artificial’ costumes. This time using the [textgenrnn](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn) which can imitate text. The idea was to predict new costumes people would come up with.

> …we turned to a machine-learning algorithm called [textgenrnn ](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn)that can learn to imitate text. Its author, Max Woolf, designed it as a blank slate ready to learn any kind of text; the text we gave it to imitate was a list of 7,182 costumes that people sent to [aiweirdness.com](http://aiweirdness.com/) over a year.

The NYT post was beautifully illustrated by [Jessia Ma](http://www.jessiama.com/) and brings the ideas to life, the costumes include classics like, “vampire chick shark” , “dragon ninja” or “cat witch”. It turns out that there is actually a [sexy dragon ninja costume](https://www.partycity.com/adult-dragon-ninja-costume-856048.html) out there so I think we’re getting close!

Earlier this week, Shane [announced](https://twitter.com/JanelleCShane/status/1183793823408906240) her [newest line of AI-generated costume](https://aiweirdness.com/post/188342947482/halloween-costumes-by-the-neural-net-gpt-2) ideas using the [GPT-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2) algorithm.

> Now, as of 2019, there are much more powerful text-generating neural nets around. One of these is GPT-2, trained by OpenAI on a huge dataset of text from the internet.

The costumes generated by GPT-2  were actually pretty good making plausible predictions beyond the training set. Here are a few of my favorites from this year’s costumes, “Gothy Giraffe”, “Sexy Pumpkin Pirate” and “Vampire in hot tub”. I think we could convert “Sexy Pumpkin Pirate” into “Spiced Pumpkin Pirate” and have a real winner on our hands!
