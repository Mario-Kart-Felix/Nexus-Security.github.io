FileVault has long been one of the most notable security & privacy features in macOS. For those unfamiliar, this built-in [encryption feature](https://beebom.com/best-usb-encryption-software/) is designed to encrypt Mac’s hard drive along with all the stored files. Using XTS-AES-128 encryption with a 256-bit key, it safeguards the information against unauthorized access on the startup disk. That being said, FileVault has had its own share of issues that seem to arrive out of nowhere. Recently, a handful of macOS users have reported that they can’t turn on FileVault on Mac. If your computer has run into the same problem, this troubleshooting guide can rescue you.

We are going to bank on three reliable solutions to get rid of this problem. _[Safe mode](https://beebom.com/how-disable-startup-programs-mac/), formatting repair, and software update_. In most cases, the first two tricks can resolve the issue right away. Just in case they fail to offer the desired result, the software update has always proved quite helpful in sorting it out. Now that you know the tricks, let’s get started!  

Use Safe Mode to Start Up Your Mac
----------------------------------

  

The first solution that we are going to try out is to start up the Mac using Safe Mode. For those who don’t know, it basically performs certain checks to prevent some unwanted software from automatically loading up. It verifies the startup disk and even tries to repair directory issues if necessary. Moreover, it also removes font caches, kernel cache, and other system cache files to make the start-up smooth sailing.  

1\. First off, **turn on or restart your Mac.**

2\. After that, press and hold the **Shift key** immediately. When the login window appears, release the **Shift key**.  

3\. After the login, try to enable FileVault. Open **System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> FileVault tab.** Now, click on the lock icon and enter your administrator password. Then, click on Turn On FileVault and follow the usual process to enable it.

**Note:**  

*   _Just in case other users have accounts on the Mac, you may see a message saying **“Each user must type in their password before they will be able to unlock the disk.”**_
  
*   _For each user, you need to click on the **Enable User** button and type in the user’s password._
  
*   _It’s worth mentioning that the user accounts which are added after the activation of FileVault are enabled automatically.  _
  

Use Disk Utility to Repair the Formatting
-----------------------------------------

  

Just in case you can’t turn on FileVault for a disk, try to repair some of the formatting information on the disk. As this solution has worked in fixing “FileVault won’t turn on” issue for many macOS users, I expect it to do the trick for you as well. You can use the stock Disk Utility app to repair the formatting with ease.  

1.  Launch the **Disk Utility** app on your Mac. You can use the Spotlight search to quickly find the app and launch it.
