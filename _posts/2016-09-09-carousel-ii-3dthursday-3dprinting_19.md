> Carousel II” is an Autodesk Fusion 360 update of my original Carousel model published over six years ago. The “secret” to how this model operates is the hidden 3D printed “sin wave” contour in the interior of the base. As the motor rotates the carousel, the lower rods of the horses ride up and down the sin wave contour thus generating the up and down motion of the horses and flags. There are four complete sin wave cycles in the base, so the horses and flags rise and fall four times each journey around the carousel.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
