> “Carousel II” is an Autodesk Fusion 360 update of my original Carousel model published over six years ago. The “secret” to how this model operates is the hidden 3D printed “sin wave” contour in the interior of the base. As the motor rotates the carousel, the lower rods of the horses ride up and down the sin wave contour thus generating the up and down motion of the horses and flags. There are four complete sin wave cycles in the base, so the horses and flags rise and fall four times each journey around the carousel.
