> I made this case to house my Raspberry Pi 3B+ and 5 inch Touchscreen (XPT2046) that I purchased from Jaycar here in New Zealand. Using it for OctoPrint with TouchUI.
> 
> NOTE: This case will not fit the Raspberry Pi 4. The Pi 4 has the Ethernet port and USB in different positions as well as having 2x micro HDMI ports as opposed to a single full size HDMI port.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
