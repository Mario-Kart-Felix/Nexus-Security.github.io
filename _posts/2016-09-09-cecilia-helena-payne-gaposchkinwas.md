Cecilia Payne discovered that stars are made largely of hydrogen and helium. She was the first woman to be appointed a full professor at Harvard University and the first to chair a department there! Via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecilia_Payne-Gaposchkin)

> Cecilia Helena Payne-Gaposchkinwas a British-born American astronomer and astrophysicist who proposed in her 1925 doctoral thesis that stars were composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. Her groundbreaking conclusion was initially rejected because it contradicted the scientific wisdom of the time, which held that there were no significant elemental differences between the Sun and Earth. Independent observations eventually proved she was correct.

Happy [Ada Lovelace Day!](http://findingada.com) Today, in honor of Ada Lovelace, the world celebrates all of the accomplishments of women in science, art, design, technology, engineering, and math. Each year, [Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/random/ald/) highlights a number of women who are pioneering their fields and inspiring women of all ages to make their voices heard. Today we will be sharing the stories of women that we think are modern day “Adas” alongside historical women that have made impacts in science and math.
