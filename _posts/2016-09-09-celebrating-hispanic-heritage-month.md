Great article from a couple years ago on Medium interviewing some Latina women working in Tech!

> Although 17% of the US population identifies as Hispanic, Latin@s make up just 3% of the workforce in tech.

In honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, we’re sharing stories from some of the amazing members of their community.
