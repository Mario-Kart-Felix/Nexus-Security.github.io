As is usually the case with CES, gaming is huge at the event this year as well. While [Nvidia and Asus unveiled a 360Hz gaming monitor](https://beebom.com/asus-360hz-gaming-monitor-unveiled-ces-2020/) at the event, Acer has also unveiled a bunch of gaming monitors with some really impressive features.  

Predator CG552K 4K OLED Monitor
-------------------------------

  

Probably the most insane gaming monitor we’ve seen so far, the Predator CG552K packs in a massive **55-inch 4K OLED display. It supports up to 400nits brightness**, and covers 98% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, so you can expect your games (and multimedia content) to look stunning, as you’d expect from an OLED display anyway.  

At 55-inches, the monitor is just way too big to be a gaming PC monitor for the most part, and as it’s already sliding into TV-sizes, Acer is mostly aiming this monitor at console gamers, what with consoles like the [Xbox One X](https://beebom.com/xbox-one-x-review/) and the [PS4 Pro](https://beebom.com/xbox-one-x-vs-ps4-pro/) supporting 4K games, and the upcoming [Xbox Series X](https://beebom.com/xbox-series-x-revealed/) and [PS5](https://beebom.com/sony-ps5-unveil-rumored-ces-2020/) which will most definitely bring even better performance to the table.  

The monitor is also [Nvidia G-Sync](https://beebom.com/best-g-sync-laptops/) compatible, and supports variable refresh rate for a smooth gaming experience. Moreover, the monitor comes with up to an incredible 0.5ms response time, and a 120Hz refresh rate.  

There’s more, by the way. The Predator CG552K **comes with a proximity sensor allowing the monitor to wake up when someone is nearby**, and go into power-saving mode when they leave the monitor’s proximity.

Acer Predator CG552K Gaming Monitor

Acer has decked out the monitor with **2x HDMI 2.0 ports, 2x DisplayPort 1.4 ports, 1x USB C port, and two USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports** as well. There are also two 10W speakers, and a customisable light-strip, because what’s more “gaming” than lights on everything.  

Acer says the monitor will be available in North America in Q3 2020, and as one might expect, it’ll be priced really high, with a **starting price of $2,999**.  

Predator X32
------------

  

The Predator X32, another gaming monitor unveiled by Acer at the event, comes with a **4K mini-LED panel with 1152 zone local dimming**. The monitor can get really bright with a maximum brightness of 1440 nits. Acer is aiming this monitor at gamers who also create their own videos, and as such, the Predator X32 **supports 10-bit color, and covers 99% of the Adobe RGB and 89.5% of the Rec2020 color gamut**.  

The IPS panel on the X32 comes with a **refresh rate of 144Hz**, and viewing angles up to 178-degrees. There’s also Nvidia G-Sync support on the monitor to reduce ghosting effects and deliver a smoother gaming experience.
