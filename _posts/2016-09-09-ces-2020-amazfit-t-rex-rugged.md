Alongside the new [Amazfit HomeStudio and Amazfit AirRun treadmills](https://beebom.com/amazfit-homestudio-airrun-treadmills-ces-2020/), and the [Amazfit ZenBuds and PowerBuds](https://beebom.com/amazfit-powerbuds-zenbuds-truly-wireless-earbuds-launched-ces-2020/), the Huami owned brand also unveiled its much leaked smartwatch called the Amazfit T-Rex at [CES 2020](https://beebom.com/tag/ces-2020). If the name wasn’t enough of a hint, the watch is a rugged smartwatch that meets the military standard quality test regulations (MIL-STD-810G).  

The watch has a polymer body and a **design that looks a lot like Casio’s G-Shock watches**; Amazfit says that it’s using ink-filling technology, along with protective bumpers on the raised bezel outside to ensure the robustness of the smartwatch. Moreover, the company says that the **T-Rex can withstand extreme temperatures**, along with exposure to salt, alkali, damp, or any other challenging outdoor conditions. It can also apparently **survive for two hours under temperature changes from -40 to 70 degrees celsius.**  

The Amazfit T-Rex features a **1.3-inch AMOLED display** with a resolution of 360×360 pixels, which isn’t the highest we’ve seen on a smartwatch with a screen this size (the [Xiaomi Watch Color](https://beebom.com/xiaomi-watch-color-launched-price-specs-features/), for example has 454×454 pixels in its 1.39-inch AMOLED screen). The watch also has **14 fitness modes, and can track activities including mountain climbing, trail running and more.** It’s also water resistant up to 5ATM (~50 meters).

Other than that, the Amazfit T-Rex also has a **PPG sensor that can track heart-rate** and provide alerts based on the information it gathers, a **3-axis gyroscope, a geomagnetic sensor, and an ambient light sensor** packed inside.  

Powering all of the watch’s features is a **390mAh battery** that Amazfit’s testing suggests will last for 20 days, and up to 66 days in basic watch mode.  

The Amazfit T-Rex will be available later this month for a suggested retail price of $139.99 (~₹9,900).
