Alongside the new [Snapdragon 8cx powered Yoga 5G laptop](https://beebom.com/lenovo-yoga-5g-with-snapdragon-8cx-launched-ces-2020/), and the [foldable ThinkPad X1 Fold](https://beebom.com/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-foldable-announced-price-specs-features-ces-2020/), Lenovo has also announced the Yoga Slim 7 laptop at [CES 2020](https://beebom.com/tag/ces-2020). The Yoga Slim 7 is an ultraslim laptop that packs in either the [newly announced AMD Ryzen 4000 series](https://beebom.com/ces-2020-amd-unveils-new-ryzen-4000-series-processors/) processors, or options from Intel.  

The Yoga Slim 7 is available in two screen sizes, a 14-inch variant available with both AMD and Intel processors, and a 15.6-inch variant that only comes with Intel processors inside. The Intel powered Yoga Slim 7 offers quite a lot of choices in other aspects as well.
