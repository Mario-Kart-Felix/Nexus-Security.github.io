It’s not just [Acer](https://beebom.com/ces-2020-acer-announces-a-55-inch-4k-oled-gaming-monitor/) or [HP](https://beebom.com/ces-2020-hp-unveils-dragonfly-g2/) that are looking to steal the show at this year’s [CES trade show](https://beebom.com/tag/ces-2020/). Lenovo has also joined the party with the launch of its first-ever eGPU enclosure dubbed the Legion BoostStation. It has also unveiled a new lightweight gaming laptop (with one major caveat, which we discuss below), the Legion Y740s, to go with its eGPU enclosure.  

Legion BoostStation
-------------------

  

First, let’s talk about the Legion Booststation. It is Lenovo’s first-ever external graphics processing unit (eGPU) and is designed specifically to accompany the Legion Y740S. It connects to your PC or laptop via Thunderbolt 3 port and can **accommodate full-size graphics cards up to 330mm in length**.

Legion BoostStation boasts an aluminium build, has a transparent side panel, and weighs around 9 kgs. In the official blog post, Lenovo states that gamers will be able to **choose between Nvidia GeForce or AMD Radeon graphics cards**. The eGPU enclosure also packs additional space to mount external storage (either an SSD or HDD) that can come handy for storing games. There’s a host of ports onboard, including an HDMI, 2 USB 3.1, one USB 2.0, and an ethernet port.  

Users can connect the Legion BoostStation, which will start at $250 and go on sale from May 2020 in the US, to their laptops using a single dedicated cable. And this is where we need to talk about the Legion Y740S because even though it’s a gaming laptop, it comes without a dedicated graphics card onboard. Yeah, a gaming laptop that’s missing a GPU, let’s take a look at its specs.  

Lenovo Legion Y740S
-------------------

  

Lenovo Legion Y740S is the latest addition to the company’s gaming laptop lineup and is dubbed the **“lightest and thinnest gaming laptop”** to date. That claim goes down the drain the moment you take a quick glance at its specs sheet.  

Legion Y740S features a design aesthetic similar to the company’s Legion Y540. It comes **equipped with a 15.6-inch 4K IPS display** with 60Hz refresh rate (so much for being dubbed a gaming laptop, right?), 100% sRGB color gamut support, and up to 600 nits of brightness. There’s also a 1080p variant.

It’s surely lightweight at 1.89 kgs (4.18 lbs) and measures 0.58-inch at its thickest point. The laptop is **powered by 10th-gen Intel Core H-Series processors**, coupled with up to 32GB of RAM and up to 1TB of PCIe SSD storage. There’s a healthy collection of ports onboard, including two Thunderbolt 3 ports, two USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports, SD card reader, a headphone jack, and ports to connect the eGPU enclosure on the side and rear end.  

We have already talked about the biggest caveat of this gaming laptop – the missing GPU onboard. You can use it as a powerful Windows 10 machine but need the eGPU enclosure for gaming purposes. Legion Y740S comes baked with a number of new gaming-specific features including Legion Coldfront 2.0 system, and Quiet Mode.  

Legion Y740S will also become available from May 2020 at a **starting price of $1,099** (around Rs. 79,500). But, the price only goes up when you bundle Legion BoostStation along with this laptop.
