Samsung has already shown off its [true bezel-less 8K smart TV](https://beebom.com/samsung-8k-qled-tv-unveiled-ces-2020/), Galaxy S10 Lite, Note 10 Lite, and other amazing gadgets at CES 2020. But, it is not done yet and has today [taken the wraps off](http://www.samsungmobilepress.com/pressreleases/elevate-the-google-experience-with-samsungs-first-ever-galaxy-chromebook) its first-ever Galaxy Chromebook at the trade show. It’s a 2-in-1 convertible laptop, which looks elegant and comes in a variety of attractive colors. It includes support for the company’s signature S-Pen, along with a weird webcam placement.  

Galaxy Chromebook boasts an aluminum build, measures just 9.9mm thick and weighs in at just around 1 kilograms. The Fiesta Red (seen below) and Mercury Gray color variants add to the charm, but it’s the **13.3-inch 4K UHD AMOLED display** (3840 x 2160 pixels resolution) that takes the cake.  

Samsung is the first company to bake an AMOLED panel into a Chromebook. It boasts a slim 3.9mm bezel and will support the HDR400 standard, which will be enabled over the coming days via an OTA update. Also, the display supports the _“Ambient EQ”_ technology we’ve previously seen on [Nest Hub](https://beebom.com/google-nest-hub-india-price/) to adjust the color temperature based on the room’s lighting.

Samsung not only takes care of the Galaxy Chromebook’s look but offers uncompromised power under the hood as well. It’s **powered by the 10th-Gen Intel Core-i5 processor**, along with up to 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of SSD storage. The company further boasts of boot times as fast as 6 seconds, Wi-Fi 6 support for a speedy Internet connection, and the built-in S-Pen that you can use to write, draw, and navigate Chrome OS.  

Galaxy Chromebook also includes a fingerprint sensor for quick unlocking, which is great, but the camera placement (8MP, rear) right above the keyboard is a little weird. But, the company is calling it a rear camera and it will come in handy in tent mode. There’s a 1MP webcam (possibly with the same potato quality as other webcams) on the front.

The Galaxy Chromebook comes equipped with a **49.2Wh battery pack**, which Samsung claims should last you at least 8 hours on a single charge. This is also the first laptop to have been co-engineered with Intel as part of the Project Athena innovation program. It will go on sale sometime in Q1 2020 at an exorbitant starting price of $999.99. There’s currently no word on whether it will arrive in India or not.
