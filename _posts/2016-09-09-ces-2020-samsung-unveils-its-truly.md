As we head into CES week in Las Vegas, companies are getting their product announcements out of the way. Following [reports that Samsung will announce an 8K TV](https://beebom.com/samsung-true-bezel-less-tv-ces-2020/) with no bezels, and having announced [new Odyssey gaming monitors](https://beebom.com/ces-2020-samsung-unveils-new-odyssey-gaming-monitors/), the South Korean giant has now unveiled its truly bezel-less 8K TV at CES 2020.  

The Samsung Q950 comes with a design that basically removes the bezel entirely, and Samsung is claiming the TV offers a screen to body ratio of 99%, which is the highest ratio in the TV market. Moreover, the **TV is just 15mm thick**, and can be mounted flush with the wall to make it look even more stunning.

Samsung has also announced that every product in the company’s 8K QLED line-up will meet the requirements of the 8K Association’s certification which [Samsung partnered with recently](https://beebom.com/samsung-8k-association-certification-program/), and will also meet the requirements of the CTA 8K Ultra HD Display Definition.  

Samsung is also saying that the Q950 is the **world’s first TV to support native 8K playback**, and support for 8K films shot with the AV1 codec. Samsung’s entire 8K line-up in 2020 will ship with these capabilities built-in.

Samsung’s new 8K QLED TV

Obviously, 8K content isn’t really available in the market yet, but Samsung has fitted its 8K TVs with its Quantum 8K Processor for upscaling non-8K content.  

Samsung QLED 8K TV: Audio Features
----------------------------------

  

For improved sound quality on the TV, Samsung has apparently put speakers on all sides of the display, along with sub-woofers in the back, and the company is using a technology called **‘Object Tracking Sound+’ which uses AI to match the movement of sound to the movement of objects on the screen**. That sounds ridiculous as well, and also something that we can’t really give an opinion about without experiencing it first.  

The new 8K QLED TV from Samsung also brings in a ton of other features and technologies into the living room, with features like an **Active Voice Amplifier that increases the volume of dialogue** if there’s a vacuum cleaner or a blender running nearby. According to Samsung’s press release, _“Active Voice Amplifier (AVA) helps the 40% of U.S. consumers who say that these sounds tend to distract them while they’re watching TV by detecting the these noises and automatically enhancing voice clarity.”_  

Samsung is yet to announce pricing or availability details for its new 8K line-up of QLED TVs, but it’s fair to assume that they’ll not be cheap by any measure.
