](https://www.trentfehl.com/projects/chamber/)Chamber is a product designed to maintain steady temperatures for a long periods of time.

Via [Trent Fehl’s Blog](https://www.trentfehl.com/projects/chamber/):

> For extended cooking processes that take weeks, months, or even sometimes years, there is not currently a good kitchen-top device that can maintain temperatures above and below room temperature. This is where ‘chamber’ comes in. Using a Peltier cooler (a solid state heat transfer device), ‘chamber’ can heat or cool to maintain set temperature over long periods of time.
> 
> ‘chamber’ is great for sourdough bread starters, pickling, mushrooms, yogurt, and other long processes. Below are a few photos of the functioning prototype that I’m using to keep my sourdough starter at 26 deg C.

> Thanks to the Peltier unit, Trent can change the temperature inside the chamber simply by alternating the direction of current flow through the Peltier. He’s doing this with an H-bridge module driven by a Raspberry Pi Zero. When it starts to get too warm in the chamber, the fan on the outside wall vents the heat away. A second fan inside the chamber pulls warm air in when it gets too cold.
