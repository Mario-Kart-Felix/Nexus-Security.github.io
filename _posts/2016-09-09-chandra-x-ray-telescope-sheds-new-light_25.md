> The Chandra X-ray Observatory has captured intriguing images of the vast Tycho supernova remnant, first noted in 1572 when the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe reported a bright “new” star in the constellation Cassiopeia. The new star was actually a Type 1a supernova, the sudden explosion of a white dwarf that had pulled in enough material from a companion to trigger a runaway nuclear detonation, blowing the star’s outer layers into the surrounding space. The result is an expanding cloud of gas that glows brightly in X-rays due to shock waves that heat the material to millions of degrees.
