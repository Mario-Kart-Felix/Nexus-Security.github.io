Chartio is changing how companies work by building the best visualization interface to data. We make connection easy and building dashboards intuitive, so anyone on a team can create beautiful charts and draw meaningful insights from their data.

  

Old Business Intelligence tools were complicated, expensive and just plain bad. We mean to change all that.

  

And that's where you come in. We’re looking for a talented software engineering manager to lead our San Francisco engineering team. You will have a team of 5 software engineers which will grow as you build out your team. Members of your team will look to you for direction and guidance on how they can contribute to Chartio’s mission to JOIN people ON data. By collaborating with product, understanding the trade offs of engineering, and knowing the business, you will be a critical part of your team’s success.
