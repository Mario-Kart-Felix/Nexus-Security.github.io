> Every good invention needs at least two parts, a pokey part and a carrying bit.  
> We start by building the pokey part. It consists of two 3D printed components, one made with black filament and the other with clear plastic.
> 
> The top part has a large indent to hold our NeoPixel Ring.  
> The bottom component has a button hole and tubing for the wiring.  
> Both the STL files are included in this step.
