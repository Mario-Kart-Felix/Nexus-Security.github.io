Google [introduced a convenient method](https://twitter.com/googledocs/status/1055490445088903168) for quickly accessing its services like Google Docs, Slides, and Sheets last year by .new shortcuts. Earlier this week, the company expanded the domain’s availability to more websites. Here is a list of all the available shortcuts that you can use to access your favorite websites and get things done faster.  

First, let’s discuss shortcuts offered by Google for its products and services. As I mentioned earlier, you can create a **new document** using [doc.new](https://doc.new), [docs.new](https://docs.new), and [documents.new](https://documents.new). For **Google Slides**, a new presentation can be started using [slide.new](https://slide.new), [slides.new](https://slides.new), [deck.new](https://deck.new), and [presentation.new](https://presentation.new).  

You can create a new **Google Form** using the shortcut [form.new](https://form.new) and [forms.new](https://forms.new). Similarly, a **new Google Sheet** can be created by using the shortcuts [sheet.new](https://sheet.new), [sheets.new](https://sheets.new), and [spreadsheet.new](https://spreadsheet.new). A **Google Site** can be created using [site.new](https://site.new), [sites.new](https://sites.new), and [website.new](https://website.new) shortcuts. Also, a new calendar event can be added to Google Calendar from [cal.new](https://cal.new) and [meeting.new](https://meeting.new).  

Now that Google’s websites are done, let’s get into third-party websites that already has support for this .new domain shortcut. You can create a **new Spotify playlist** using [playlist.new](https://playlist.new/). Starting to write a story on **Medium** is as simple as going to [story.new](https://story.new/).  

You can create a new design on **Canva** from [canva.new](https://canva.new/), start a personal meeting room on **Cisco Webex** using [webex.new](https://webex.new/), and create a new short link on **Bitly** using [link.new](https://link.new/). A new repository on **GitHub** can be created using [repo.new](https://repo.new), anything can be sold on eBay from [sell.new](https://sell.new), and a new reservation on **OpenTable** can be made on [reservation.new](https://reservation.new).  

Other shortcuts include [invoice.new](https://invoice.new/) to create invoices from **Stripe Dashboard**, [api.new](https://api.new/) for starting **RunKit**, [coda.new](https://coda.new) for creating a new document in **Coda**, and [music.new](https://music.new) for creating personalized album artwork for **OVO Sound**.  

If you are a business owner, you can start registering for trademarked .new domains starting today till January 14, 2020. Registered applicants can apply for .new domains starting this December 2, 2019. However, make sure you do it as soon as possible since the domain shortcut would get opened to be registered by anyone starting July 21, 2020.  

So, which domain shortcut did you like the most? Tell us in the comments.
