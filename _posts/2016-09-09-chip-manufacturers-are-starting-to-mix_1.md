Chip manufacturers are starting to mix their sensors with ML to get gesture recognition and motion tracking …. [iNEMO™ 6-axis IMU with Machine Learning Core webinar](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/about/events/events.html/inemo-6-axis-imu-with-mlc-webinar-ame-2019.html).

> The LSM6DSOX contains finite-state machine logic (FSM) and a Machine Learning Core (MLC) that allow classification of motion data based on known patterns. These unique features relieve the main processor from the first stage of activity tracking, saving energy to accelerate motion-based applications. Devices equipped with the LSM6DSOX can deliver a convenient and responsive “always-on” user experience without sacrificing battery runtime.
> 
> The device also has more internal memory than conventional sensors and a state-of-the-art high-speed I3C digital interface, allowing shorter connection times and longer periods between interactions with the main controller, resulting in even greater energy savings. The LSM6DSOX boosts performance at 0.55 mA in high-performance mode while offering low-power features for an optimal motion tracking experience.
