> My current art practice revolves around biology. I focus on the human anatomy, mainly looking at different skin surfaces. Some of my previous work has looked into psychology and the philosophy of the mind, which I made into my first book in 2013 called _Source_, a practical study of people’s most significant objects and favourite colours.

> I have a DIY lab at home. It has evolved wonderfully throughout the years. What started with a cardboard box lined with foil and a lamp used for heating pig shelters has now evolved into a terrarium and a much smaller heat source used for keeping reptiles warm. I use pre-poured agar plates for my samples. Oh, and a thermometer of course! When my samples have grown, I take them to a photography studio and later on use Photoshop to jazz them up one by one. For some of my artworks, I’ve used a microscope, and that’s my real happy place.
