> Chord Assist is a system that makes learning the guitar more accessible to people who have vision, speech, or hearing issues. In [its prototype form](https://medium.com/google-developer-experts/chord-assist-building-an-accessible-smart-guitar-for-the-mute-deaf-and-blind-4f81669ab663), the guitar features a button that is pressed to enable a microphone built into the instrument, enabling the student to ask for a chord that is then explained using a built-in speaker.
> 
> Alternatively, the guitar also features an LCD with buttons that enable users to manually select the chord they want to learn, which is presented as a visual guide on the screen. Finally, there are also large interactive dots that function as a raised Braille format to help blind and low-vision individuals learn chords using touch.
