Google has just started rolling out **Chrome 80** to the stable channel on Windows, Mac and Linux, bringing a new feature that many users have been clamoring for in recent months. [Originally rolled out to the Canary channel](https://beebom.com/google-chrome-will-now-silence-annoying-notification-requests-from-websites/) last month, the so-called ‘quieter UI’ will significantly cut down on annoying notification permissions from websites. In addition, Chrome 80.0.3987.87 also contains a number of fixes improvements, including 56 security patches.  

According to Google, the new UI will bring a _“new, quieter notification permission UI that reduces the interruptiveness of notification permission requests”_. While the quieter UI will be an opt-in functionality for the most part, Google says it will be automatically enabled for users who generally block notification requests and on sites with very low opt-in rates. It can be enabled manually via Settings > Site Settings > Notifications > Use Quieter Messaging.

Alongside the aforementioned feature, Chrome 80 has also started implementing a new SameSite cookie classification system that restricts cookie access to first-party by default (`sameSite=Lax`) unless explicitly marked for third-party usage (`SameSite+None`). Chrome first announced this change in May 2019, and followed it up with a reminder for developers in October 2019 before rolling it out with the latest version of its web-browser.  

  

Chrome 80 started rolling out to the stable channel on Tuesday, February 4, but enforcement of the new cookie classification system will only begin later in the month with a small population of users, gradually increasing over time. You can check out more information on the subject on the official [SameSite Update page](https://www.chromium.org/updates/same-site). You can also check out an official video from Google to get a better understanding.
