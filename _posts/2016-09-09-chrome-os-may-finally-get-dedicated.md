Chrome OS developers are apparently working on a dedicated media app that might soon replace the Files app as the platform’s default media player. That’s [according to ChromeStory](https://www.chromestory.com/2019/12/chromebook-media-app/), which says a **System Web App (SWA) called ‘Media App’** has shown up in the latest build of [Chrome OS](https://beebom.com/chrome-os-tablets-new-ui-gesture-navigation/) Canary channel that was rolled out recently. It is, however, still in the very early stages of development with a rudimentary UI and basic playback options for audio and video files.

According to the report, the app can be accessed via the URL: _chrome://media-app_, as well as from the launcher shortcut. Once launched, the app reportedly shows an ‘OPEN’ button with instructions to ‘Drag and drop a file or select open’, as can be seen from the screenshot below. The report goes on to say that the app did play the videos alright, but only with bare-bones control options, including a basic play/pause button. It also has a few basic image editing options like the existing Gallery app.

System Web Apps are Google’s latest addition to Chrome OS as part of a concerted effort that some observers believe might be in preparation for the [upcoming Fuschia OS](https://beebom.com/what-fuchsia-os/). As pointed out by ChromeStory, a couple of the prominent examples are the existing Camera and Settings apps that recently got SWA versions, although the upcoming Media app is a whole new deal from scratch. While the latest developments are certainly interesting, Google is yet to say anything officially on this front, so we’ll likely have to wait a while longer to know more.
