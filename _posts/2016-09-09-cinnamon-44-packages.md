Cinnamon 4.4 is out and while it's not officially announced as per this post is created, i have prepared the SlackBuild scripts along with the binary packages ready for Slackware-Current users. These new set of packages adds two new dependencies: pytz and libtimezonemap, but removed some of the packages that are no longer needed or have become part of Slackware Current.  
  
Cinnamon 4.4 brings more improvements towards HiDPI especially through the icons, new XAppStatus applet, performance improvements, nemo external condition support, new scrollbar settings, and many more. Expect details on Clem announcement soon.  
  
The SlackBuild script is now pushed to master branch of [CSB Project](https://github.com/cinnamonslackbuilds/csb), so feel free to pull latest update and run the build-cinnamon.sh script if you want to build it from source. Binary packages are available via [http://slackware.uk/csb/current/x86\_64/](http://slackware.uk/csb/current/x86_64/).
