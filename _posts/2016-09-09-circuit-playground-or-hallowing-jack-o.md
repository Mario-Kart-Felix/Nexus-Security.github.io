Claws-down, Halloween is my favorite holiday. Add some electronics to the mix and it’s an unstoppable force of nature.

In this simple **no-soldering-required** project we’ll make the Adafruit **Circuit Playground Classic** or **Circuit Playground Express** board act like a **flickering candle.** Pop this inside a jack-o’-lantern (or any other item that might normally use flame) to create a festive spooky atmosphere. (This can also work with an Adafruit **Hallowing** board with a NeoPixel strip plugged in the NEOPIX port.)

Sure, one can just _buy_ a fake battery-operated candle, but they’re usually pretty dim. Also, we can take this as an opportunity to learn a bit about code…and once Halloween’s over (_how sad!_) the Circuit Playground board can be _used again_ in endless _other_ projects.

**Items needed:**

*   Adafruit **[Circuit Playground Classic](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3000)** or **[Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333)** board.
*   Either a **[3xAAA battery holder](https://www.adafruit.com/products/727) **_\-or-_ a **[USB phone charger](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1959)** & cable
*   **Pumpkin** and **carving tools**, or other decorative item to illuminate (very effective with paper lanterns!)
*   **Zip-Loc bag**, if using a real pumpkin
