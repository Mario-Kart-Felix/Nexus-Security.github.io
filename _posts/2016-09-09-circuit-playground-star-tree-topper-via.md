**Liz Clark**, AKA [BlitzCityDIY](https://twitter.com/BlitzCityDIY) recently posted a remix of one of our [**Circuit Playground snap fit cases**](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2585702). Just in time for the holidays, this turns any Circuit Playground into a light-up tree topper. We printed it on our Creality CR-10S using Eryone Silky Gold PLA. A Circuit Playground Bluefruit works well here since we can change up the NeoPixel colors and animations. We wired up a JST slide switch adapter and used a 500mAh battery. The case has a built-in holder for the slide switch so it’s easy to turn it on/off. It also fits nicely on our Christmas tree! If you’d like to build your own, check it out on Thingiverse.
