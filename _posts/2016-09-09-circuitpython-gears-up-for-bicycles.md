Joey, started a CLUE bike-mountable commuter computer. It’s CircuitPython powered, connected to an iPhone for weather reports, reminders and turn-by-turn directions, the CLUE has tons of environment sensing, including ambient noise on-board – [Twitter](https://twitter.com/josecastillo/status/1225877474833321986).
