Python is often touted as a great language for beginner coders to learn. Until recently, however, it simply wasn’t a viable choice in the embedded space. That’s begun to change with projects like CircuitPython, [and now it’s available on the Teensy 4.0!](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/01/10/testing-circuitpython-on-teensy-4-0-iot-made-easy-ioteensy-adafruit-circuitpython-arturo182-tannewt-nxp-paulstoffregen/)

This milestone is thanks in part to \[arturo182\], who did the ground work of getting CircuitPython to run on the iMX RT series of microcontrollers. This was built upon by \[tannewt\], who is the lead in charge of the CircuitPython project.

There are some bugs to work out; currently, the project is in a very early stage of development. \[Paul Stoffregen\], who heads Teensy development, has already pointed out that [there needs to be allowance for the 4096 byte recovery partition in the Teensy 4.0’s storage,](https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/59028-Teensy-4-Circuit-Phython?p=226156&viewfull=1#post226156) for example. Development continues at a rapid pace, and those with ideas about where the project should go [can weigh in online.](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/01/01/what-do-you-want-from-circuitpython-in-2020-circuitpython2020-circuitpython/)

It’s an exciting development, which brings easy Python development to one of the more powerful embedded development platforms on the market. We look forward to seeing many more projects take advantage of the power of the Teensy 4.0 moving forward. If you’re eager to see what can be done with CircuitPython, [be sure to check out projects we’ve featured before.](https://hackaday.com/tag/circuitpython/) Video after the break.
