Arturo sent us some Feather M7’s based on the fancy new RT1011 – this chip runs at 500 MHz but is only a couple $ ([video](https://youtu.be/KVpkW4LMaVU)). With plenty of QSPI FLASH on board and RAM, it can make for a nice IoT engine. Here I’m using it with our ESP32 AirLift FeatherWing for WiFi connectivity, and a small color TFT. The code is about 80 lines of CircuitPython – [available here](https://github.com/ladyada/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/tree/master/CircuitStonks).
