An update to an awesome project via [Gothamist](https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/city-women-subway-map-gets-2019-update):

> This re-imagined subway map (originally created by Rebecca Solnit and Joshua Jelly-Schapiro in 2016 and recently updated for 2019) is identical to the MTA’s current map, with one exception: every station is named after a notable woman with a New York connection.
> 
> Newly-added names include Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Cardi B, the All-Girl Robotics Team in the Bronx, and the poet Jacqueline Woodson.
> 
> Jelly-Schapiro, a geographer and writer, told Gothamist that he and Solnit were inclined to revisit the map and add more names to it because of how much has changed since 2016.
