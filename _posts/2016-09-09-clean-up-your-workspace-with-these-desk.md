Organization is vital to productivity. It wastes time if you have to dig through a drawer whenever you need a pen. An organizer can make your desk a much more efficient workspace.

**What Do You Need?**
---------------------

There are a lot of desk organizers available today, and people’s needs and preferences range wildly. This can make it hard to determine which one is best for you. Here are some general guidelines that can help you decide what you need:

*   **Size:** You don’t want an organizer that eats up a large portion of your desk, but you _do_ want one with enough space for everything you need to store in it. Finding the right balance between size and storage is crucial.
*   **Compartments: **The number and size of storage compartments vary. Depending on what you plan to store in an organizer, the size of certain compartments can become burdensome or useless. So, think about everything you want to store in your organizer, and then choose one that can handle it all.
*   **Convenience:** The point of an organizer is to make it easier to find what you’re looking for. Overly-complicated organizers make this difficult. Choose one that allows you to simply reach over and grab what you need.

Let’s take a look at some of the best, most efficient desk organizers out there.

Not everyone needs an elaborate, multilevel organizer. Many people just need a place to throw pens and paper clips. Amazon’s organizer fulfills that need with a focused and compact design (4.5 x 9.34 inches).

It has two larger compartments on either side for pens, pencils, or highlighters. The three cubbies on top are perfect for smaller objects, like thumbtacks and paper clips. And the small, pull-out compartment on the bottom is the perfect size for Post-its.
