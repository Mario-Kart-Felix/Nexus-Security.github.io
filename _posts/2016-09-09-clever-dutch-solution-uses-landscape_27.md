A rolling field of man-made mounds serves as a noise barricade. The unique angles absorb and deflect many sound frequencies. The sound barrier park actually reminds me a lot of a landscape art project in [Storm King Art Center](https://stormking.org/artist/maya-lin/).

Via [Core77](https://www.core77.com/posts/90879/Clever-Dutch-Solution-Uses-Landscape-Architecture-to-Reduce-Airport-Noise):

> “The residents of Hoofddorp-Noord have experienced extra inconvenience from ground noise since \[additional runways\] opened in 2003,” explains Schiphol Airport’s website. “Ground noise is the low, rumbling sound that aircraft make when they take off. That noise can travel even further in winter, when the ground is often wet or frozen.”
> 
> Enter the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (abbreviated TNO in Dutch), an independent organization formed by the government to science the shit out of pressing problems. Working together with H+N+S Landscape Architects, the team learned from local residents that the runway noise was mysteriously quieter at certain times of the year, independent of traffic. Investigation revealed that whenever nearby farm fields were plowed, the volume level went down.
