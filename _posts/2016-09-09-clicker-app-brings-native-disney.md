Disney+ launched earlier this month in various countries including the United States, Canada, Netherlands, Australia, and New Zealand. However, a native dedicated official app for the streaming service is not available on macOS so far. Hence, macOS users have to use the service in the browser, which can be quite inconvenient. Well, not anymore. A developer has created a standalone app called Clicker that offers a native experience of Disney+ on macOS.  

Clicker for Disney+ app for macOS lets you get that seamless experience you always wanted. You can launch the Clicker app right from your macOS dock. Moreover, it supports the **native picture-in-picture mode** of macOS, a feature that a lot of people will appreciate.  

The best part about the Clicker app is its **integration with Touch Bar**. You can use the Touchbar for controlling the captions, toggling picture-in-picture mode, and even media controls. Cool, right?  

As far as the pricing and availability are concerned, the app is being offered for free. All you have to do is enter your email address to access the download link. In case you’re looking for other streaming services, the developer offers macOS apps for [Netflix](https://www.dbklabs.com/clicker-for-netflix/), [Hulu](https://www.dbklabs.com/clicker-for-hulu/), and [YouTube TV](https://www.dbklabs.com/clicker-for-youtube-tv/).  

With over [10 million subscribers within the first 24 hours](https://beebom.com/disney-10-million-subscribers-day-1/), Disney+ does seem to attract a lot of Disney fans.
