The really fun part came when I started using it for stop motion. The first video below gives an overview of the project showing the simulated touch-screen effects towards the end. It’s intended for general audiences to maximize views. Please share it with as many people as you can. The 2nd video contains all the details you makers will want to know in case you want to replicate the project or do your own unique version with similar hardware.
