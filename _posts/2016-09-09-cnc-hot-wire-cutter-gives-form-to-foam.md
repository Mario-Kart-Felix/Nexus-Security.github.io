Rapid prototyping tools are sometimes the difference between a project getting off the ground and one that stays strictly on paper. A lightweight, easy-to-form material is often all that’s needed to visualize a design and make a quick judgment on how to proceed. Polymeric foams excel in such applications, and [a CNC hot-wire foam cutter](https://howtomechatronics.com/projects/arduino-cnc-foam-cutting-machine/) is a tool that makes dealing with them quick and easy.

We’re used to seeing CNC machines where a lot of time and expense are put into making the frame as strong and rigid as possible. But \[HowToMechatronics\] knew that the polystyrene foam blocks he’d be using would easily yield to a hot nichrome wire, minimizing the cutting forces and the need for a stout frame. But the aluminum extrusions, 3D-printed connectors. and linear bearings he used still make for a frame stiff enough to give clean, accurate cuts. The addition of a turntable to the bed is a nice touch, turning the tool into a 2.5D machine. The video below details the construction and goes into depth on the toolchain \[HowToMechatronics\] used to go from design to G-code, including the tricks he used for making a continuous path, as well as integrating the turntable to make three-dimensional designs.

Plenty of hot-wire foam cutters have graced our pages before, everything from [tiny hand-held cutters](https://hackaday.com/2018/02/08/build-a-tiny-hot-wire-foam-cutter/) to [a hot-wire “table saw” for foam](https://hackaday.com/2016/01/28/super-slick-super-portable-styrofoam-slicer/). We like the effort put into this one, though, and the possibilities it opens up.

Thanks to \[Keith O.\] for the tip.
