> With the rise of the railways and commercial shipping, colour blindness became recognised as a potential threat to life. In 1855, George Wilson, an Edinburgh professor of technology, published [_Researches on Colour Blindness: with a Supplement on the Danger Attending the Present System of Railway and Marine Coloured Signals_](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/cjuzkwzt).
