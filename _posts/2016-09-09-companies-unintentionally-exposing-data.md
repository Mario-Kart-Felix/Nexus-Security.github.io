Security analysts from OTORIO have as of late discovered that a huge number of unprotected files from companies over the pharmaceutical, industrial, automotive and food sectors have been unintentionally exposing data including blueprints and intellectual property by misusing Alphabet's virus scanner.  
  
Daniel Bren, CEO at Otorio said that, “From what we found, we could design a very constructive hack. We found files that gave us a blueprint of how to infiltrate the production floor. The companies’ trademarked secrets are on those blueprints,”  
  
All this was however possible on account of VirusTotal, a virus scanner, owned by Alphabet’s cybersecurity subsidiary Chronicle. This virus scanner makes 'scanned documents' accessible to organizations for the identification of malware; be that as it may, a few companies are abusing the virus scanner and are uncovering sensitive documents.  
  
Bren noticed that researchers can gain admittance to the uploaded files with a deal to avoid utilizing the data. Notwithstanding, a few researchers are misusing the service and are 'publishing the incoming documents'.  
  
A representative for VirusTotal said that the company screens all customers before giving them access to the information. “Researchers don’t have searchable access to the file base and customers that are found to abuse any data are cut off,” the spokesperson said.  
  
Nonetheless Otorio had informed VirusTotal about its discoveries in July and the company subsequently acknowledged it concurring that there was a need to bring issues to light about how the administration functions and how security applications ought to be arranged.
