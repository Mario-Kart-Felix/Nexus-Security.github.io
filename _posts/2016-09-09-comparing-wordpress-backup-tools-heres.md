Be it through identity thefts, stealing of customer information, or cyber-attacks, data breaches are a reality in today’s connected world. A whopping [90% of WordPress sites](https://wpwebhost.com/blog/statistics-90-of-wordpress-websites-were-infected-in-2018/) were infected in 2018 according to WPWebHost.

As a WordPress website owner, you may ask, “How is all this relevant for website backups?” Depending on the type of online attack, a data breach can seriously compromise your website as well as impact your business operations due to loss of critical business data such as customer invoices, purchase orders, confidential data, and much more! Additionally, it can destroy customers’ trust in your business, particularly if customer data has been breached.

Having a sound WordPress backup process in place is the only guard against such an eventuality. If anything untoward happens to your website, you can restore it along with your business data from the securely stored backup.

How do I take a Complete Backup of my WordPress Website?
--------------------------------------------------------

Now that we know the importance of taking a backup, the next question is how to perform this task? Whether you are a technical or non-technical person, creating and maintaining backups can be a tedious process. If you do happen to have the technical knowledge, you can choose to manually backup your WordPress website (as detailed [here](https://blogvault.net/how-to-manually-backup-your-wordpress-site/)).

Luckily, there are automated backup tools available in the market today that can make this process quite easy. Before choosing the right backup tool, you must first know the pros and cons of each of these tools. Through this comparison article, we have done just that! Here are our findings on the pros and cons of the following five leading WordPress backup tools:

*   [BlogVault](https://wpmayor.com/link/blogvault/)
*   [BackupBuddy](https://wpmayor.com/link/backupbuddy/)
*   [UpdraftPlus](https://updraftplus.com/)
*   [Codeguard](https://wpmayor.com/link/codeguard/)
*   [VaultPress](https://vaultpress.com/)

Let’s look at each of them in detail.

Some of its best features include:

The website staging feature allows you to update and test your website plugins and themes safely without any impact on your live website. The merging feature allows you to apply these changes from the staging environment to the live website.

*   Website management acts as an independent dashboard from which you can update your installed website plugins/ themes, manage user privileges, and generate customised reports. Featuring 2-Factor Authentication protection, you can now monitor and take backups of multiple websites from a centralised location.
*   Support for WooCommerce Backups helps you perform real-time backups of [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/)\-powered websites used by E-commerce companies. WooCommerce backups typically include data related to customer orders, product catalogues, shipping information, and more.
