Those working in the pharmaceutical field often come across issues at the crossroads between IP and competition law. Our friends at Informa are organizing a 1-day event to discuss the latest developments in the field of competition law as applied to the pharmaceutical sector.

  

Held in Brussels on 4 December 2019, this 1-day conference will cover the latest market trends, policy and case law developments, as well as practical strategies to address the new challenges currently affecting the pharmaceutical sector across Europe.

  

Speakers include representatives of the European Commission, national regulators, in-house counsel and eminent lawyers from across the industry.

  

The other good news is that there is a special 15% IPKat discount for this event.
