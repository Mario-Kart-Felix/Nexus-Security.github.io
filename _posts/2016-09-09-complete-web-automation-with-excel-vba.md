**Description**  
Using a website has become part of everyday life in both work and play. Many of us spend hours a day scouring the web or filling out tedious forms online for work!  
But what if we can automate these processes that steal our precious time away from us? Introducing “Complete Web Automation with Excel VBA” course. In this jam-packed, progressive course, I share over eight hours of secrets to using the popular website testing program called Selenium, ( previously only available using complicated web languages such as JavaScript or PHP). This free tool is now available to all Microsoft Excel users, but there’s very little documentation for how to use it unless you are a web developer.  
  
Throughout the course, I take you through all the undocumented processes, enabling you to locate and interact with any element on a webpage using a variety of strategies, from basic text & attribute searches to Advanced strategies such as XPath, CSS Selectors, and Regular Expression (RegEx) functionalities.  
  
You’ll learn how to fill out web forms dynamically, navigate web pages intuitively, and extract and manipulate data to increase efficiency.  
Then we’ll learn how and when to trigger macros with precision using “Timeouts and Waits”!  
  
In addition to basic navigation, I’ll show you how to Open, Access and Toggle multiple tab Windows, how to resize, re-position and auto-scroll your browser window as well as use login techniques with set credentials. You’ll be able to deal with pop-ups, alerts, notifications, and Frames like an expert. I’ll even show you the secrets of controlling the clipboard, saving screenshots to your Excel file or even taking all or parts of online tables into your spreadsheets automatically. Finally, I’ll take you through drop-down menus and working with list boxes to complete your WebDriver mastery.  
The course comes loaded with several examples in each section, including several engaging and challenging exercises to help you solidify what you’ve learned (with solution videos immediately following).
