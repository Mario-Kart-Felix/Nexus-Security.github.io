On [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EOuK2O1r2A), Digi-Key presents a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EOuK2O1r2A) on how to connect an [Adafruit ADXL343 plus ADT7410 sensor FeatherWing board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4147) to an [Adafruit Feather Huzzah32 microprocessor board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405). This combination is programmed to  communicate to [DK IoT Studio from Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/design-tools/dk-iot-studio).

> Digi-Key IoT Studio makes it easy to add motion sensing to wireless or cloud projects with preconfigured development boards such as the Adafruit ADXL343 FeatherWing. In this tutorial, Robin first explains how to set up the ADXL343 motion sensor in Digi-key’s DK IoT Studio using the proper elements and linking configurations to send X, Y and Z axis data values as well as a configurable vector calculation. The Adafruit ADXL343 Feather Wing has other features such as “Tap” detection function that may be added to a project.
