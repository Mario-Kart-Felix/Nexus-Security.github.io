As predicted by rumor mills, Apple has launched [AirPods Pro](https://beebom.com/airpods-pro-announced-price-features-availability/) ([$249](https://geni.us/3A4ubw)) with an all-new design. Boasting active noise cancellation with transparency mode, a high-dynamic-range amplifier, H1 chip (also found on AirPods 2), and super comfy ergonomic profile, Apple’s wireless earphones look primed to deliver top-notch music listening and hands-free calling experience. Just in case you are gearing to buy these wireless earphones, let me tell you that they don’t support many older yet capable iPhones, unlike their cheaper siblings. So, you better take a look at the AirPods Pro supported iPhones, iPads, and iPods before hitting the “Add to Cart” button.  

### AirPods Pro Compatible iPhones, iPads, and iPods

  

Like many iPhone users, I was also expecting the AirPods Pro to be fully compatible with at least the iPhones that come with A10 chip. If 5th-gen iPad with A9 chip can work with the wireless earphones, I don’t see any reason why the more capable iPhone 7 (that was launched alongside the original AirPods in 2016) wouldn’t have gotten along with the earphones. Clearly, it’s Apple’s smart strategy to compel customers to upgrade to newer devices, which might be good from a business perspective. But as an end-user, I feel a little disappointed for those who have missed out on the train.
