[Techmirtz](https://www.hackster.io/techmirtz/home-automation-using-google-assistant-and-adafruit-io-046067) is controlling a 60W (not smart!) bulb using the Google Assistant voice-based command service. [Adafruit IO, our free IoT service,](http://io.adafruit.com/) has built-in integration with services like IFTTT.

> So, when I use Google Assistant on my mobile and give voice command as “Ok Google, Turn LED ON”, applet created in IFTTT receives this command and will send data ‘1’ to the Adafruit feed. This will trigger the event on the Adafruit dashboard which is continuously monitored by the microcontroller (here NodeMCU). This microcontroller will take action as per the data change on the Adafruit dashboard.
