Some neurological disorders, like Parkinson’s disease, can cause muscle tremors which can get worse as time goes along. In the beginning it may not be too difficult to manage, but as the disease progresses the tremors get worse and worse, until day-to-day movements are extremely difficult. Even picking up a fork or pouring a glass of water becomes nearly impossible. Some helpful tools have been designed to limit the impacts of the tremors, but [this new device seeks to dampen the tremors directly](https://fivemicrons.com/).

A research team from Fresno State has been developing the Tremelo, which is a hand stabilizer that straps onto the arm of a person suffering from tremors. It has sets of tuned mass dampers in each of two enclosures, which rapidly shift the weights inside to counter the motion of the wearer’s tremors. The device has already shown success in 36 trial patients and does an incredible job at limiting the amount of tremors the user experiences, and also has a bonus of being non-invasive for the wearer.

The team has successfully trialed the program, but is currently [seeking funding on Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tremelo-hand-stabilizer-for-essential-tremor#/). The project seems worthwhile and is a novel approach to a common problem. In the past, devices (admittedly with a much cheaper price tag) [try to solve the problem externally](https://hackaday.com/2019/01/09/adaptive-spoon-helps-those-with-parkinsons/) rather than in the direction that the Tremelo has gone, and it’s a unique idea that shows a lot of promise.
