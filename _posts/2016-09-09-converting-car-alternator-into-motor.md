In this video from the [Austiwawa](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkURR2CLd5iDc0B11rSkFeg) _YouTube_ channel, Austin shows how easy it is to turn a car/truck alternator into an electric motor for powering a Go Kart. Austin got his alternator from a Ford F-150.

For those who’ve converted servo motors into standard DC gearbox motors, the process is similar, with removing the control electronics (the diode pack). Then, it’s just a matter of wiring your new motor to the battery and motor controller.
