The [Mare and Gal Electronics blog posts](https://e.pavlin.si/2019/11/18/convert-ttig-to-ttog/) about converting a The Things Network indoor gateway (TTIG) to an outdoor gateway (TTOG).

> I bought used outdoor WiFi access point for couple of coffees. At first I wanted to use only the housing for conversion of the [TTN Indoor gateway](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/gateways/thethingsindoor/) to outdoor gateway. But after some testing and factory reset of the AP I found out it is working and could be configured as stand-alone WiFi MIMO AP. Usually such APs require infrastructure, or at least some management server.

> The conversion requires few steps:
> 
> 1.  Attachment of the TTIG inside housing
> 2.  Connecting external antenna
> 3.  Providing the power supply
> 4.  Providing access to WiFi
> 5.  Configuration

[See the post](https://e.pavlin.si/2019/11/18/convert-ttig-to-ttog/) for the whole process. TTN certainly doesn’t make it easy.
