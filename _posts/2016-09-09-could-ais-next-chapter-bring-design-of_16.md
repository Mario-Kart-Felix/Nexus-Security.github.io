New research paper from Kingson Man and Antonio Damasio at Brain and Creativity Institute, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, looks into robots with feeling.

Via [Tech Xplore](https://techxplore.com/news/2019-11-ai-chapter-machines.html):

> Feelings are a mental expression of the state of life in the body and play a critical role in regulating behavior. “Our goal here is to inquire about conditions,” said the authors, “that would potentially allow machines to care about what they do or think.”
> 
> Jan Cortes in Medical Daily: “The gist is simple: Simply build a robot that would have the ability to be aware of its existence, and the perils of it… a modern A.I. brain could easily develop feelings and behavior that will help guide it to self-preservation and survival.”

> “Even if they would never achieve full-blown inner experience in the human sense,” said the authors about the robots, “their properly motivated behaviour would result in expanded intelligence and better-behaved autonomy.”
