While there are many free WordPress themes available, there’s no denying that some sites demand more advanced designs and functionality. Buying premium themes can help with this, but first, you have to find them.

Fortunately, there are several top-notch online marketplaces that sell WordPress products. With thousands of premium themes available, these sites are excellent places to pick up a new one.

To narrow your search, we’ve rounded up seven of the best marketplaces where you can buy premium themes for WordPress. Let’s get right to it!

1\. [ThemeForest](https://wpmayor.com/link/themeforest/)
--------------------------------------------------------

![The ThemeForest online marketplace.](https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/themeforest.png)

[ThemeForest](https://wpmayor.com/link/themeforest/) is part of the [Envato](https://envato.com/) family of online marketplaces, which specialize in creative digital assets such as graphics, stock videos, and WordPress products. Developers can create accounts to sell their themes on this platform, resulting in a wide variety of options.

Just about anyone should be able to buy premium themes for their site here. There are over 47,000 to choose from, geared towards all types of WordPress sites. Prices start as low as $2 and can rise into the hundreds.

Each theme is [quality checked by Envato](https://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202500934-Common-Rejection-Reasons-for-Envato-Market) before it’s posted for sale. However, the marketplace doesn’t maintain the themes afterward – that’s up to the developer. When purchasing from ThemeForest, it’s wise to look for the last update:

This will help you avoid forking over cash for outdated code that could cause problems for your site. Generally speaking, you should avoid any theme that hasn’t been updated for more than six months.

2\. [Themify](https://wpmayor.com/link/themify/)
------------------------------------------------

![The Themify online marketplace.](https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/themify.png)

[Themify](https://wpmayor.com/link/themify/) has 42 unique themes for sale, all built on its framework. They cover many different use cases, including e-commerce, blogs, portfolios, and more.

Each theme includes advanced features including:

*   Drag-and-drop front end building
*   Pre-built demo content
*   Detailed customization options

You can buy premium themes here for $59 per year. However, you can also purchase a membership to one of [Themify’s ‘clubs’](https://wpmayor.com/link/themify/) to gain access to all 42, as well as plugins, support, and updates. This marketplace has a 30-day moneyback guarantee as well, so you can return products if you change your mind.

3\. [MOJO Marketplace](https://wpmayor.com/link/mojo-marketplace/)
------------------------------------------------------------------

![The MOJO Marketplace homepage.](https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/mojo-marketplace.png)

Another huge platform for selling online digital products is [MOJO Marketplace](https://wpmayor.com/link/mojo-marketplace/). With over 900 WordPress themes and templates available, this is another ideal resource for site owners with unique needs and those who want to browse a wide variety of options.

Prices are set by individual sellers, but most fall within the $49 – $59 per year range. In addition to buying premium WordPress themes, you can also purchase add-ons to have them professionally installed, access demo content, or set up backup services for your site.

MOJO marketplace has a [review team](https://mojosupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202740255-Why-did-my-item-get-rejected-) in place to ensure the quality of the products sold on their platform. However, individual sellers are still responsible for providing updates to their themes. You should always check the date of the most recent one before making a purchase:

Outdated code could create vulnerabilities in your site, so an up-to-date theme is a necessity.

4\. [CSSIgniter](https://wpmayor.com/link/cssigniter/)
------------------------------------------------------

![The CSSIgniter online marketplace.](https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/cssigniter.png)

As an official WordPress.com theme provider, [CSSIgniter](https://wpmayor.com/link/cssigniter/) is a prime source for quality products to enhance your site. They have 81 premium themes for sale that cover several niches including hotel and restaurant sites.

Themes from CSSIgniter include optional demo content to help you start off right. Simply import the pre-built layouts and content, then customize it with your own text and images.

Individual themes are priced at $34.30 for lifetime usage and one year of updates and support. Alternatively, you can join one of the [CSSIgniter clubs](https://wpmayor.com/link/cssigniter/) for access to all their themes, as well as plugins and other products, too.

5\. [Elegant Themes](https://wpmayor.com/link/elegant-themes/)
--------------------------------------------------------------

![The Elegant Themes homepage.](https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/elegant-themes.png)

[Elegant Themes](https://wpmayor.com/link/elegant-themes/) is best known for [Divi](https://wpmayor.com/link/divi/), the theme with page building capabilities. However, they also sell the Divi-based Extra, which is designed for bloggers and other online publishers.

Two themes might seem insignificant next to ThemeForest’s 47,000, but Divi is one of the most popular premium WordPress themes available, for good reason. The level of customization you can achieve with this tool far outweighs any other.

The only place you can buy this premium theme is on the Elegant Themes website. $89 per year or a one-time purchase of $249 grants you access to Divi, Extra, and two plugins.

6\. [ThemeIsle](https://wpmayor.com/link/themeisle/)
----------------------------------------------------

![The ThemeIsle homepage.](https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/themeisle.png)

Like Elegant Themes, [ThemeIsle](https://wpmayor.com/link/themeisle/) is best known for its most popular product, [Hestia](https://themeisle.com/themes/hestia-pro/?ref=6862). However, they also have three other premium tools you can choose from: [Neve](https://themeisle.com/themes/neve/?ref=6862), [Zelle](https://themeisle.com/themes/zelle-pro-one-page-wordpress-theme/?ref=6862), and [ShopIsle](https://themeisle.com/themes/shop-isle-pro/?ref=6862).

Each of these themes includes page builder compatibility with popular plugins including [Beaver Builder](https://wpmayor.com/link/beaver-builder/) and [Elementor](https://wpmayor.com/link/elementor/). There are also numerous demos you can use to quickly create a professional-looking site.

Single site licenses for Hestia Pro, Zelle Pro, and ShopIsle Pro come in at $69 per year. Neve is slightly more affordable at $39 per year. If you’re looking to buy a premium theme, you can get a lot of bang for your buck with these ones.

7\. [StudioPress](https://wpmayor.com/link/studiopress/)
--------------------------------------------------------

![The StudioPress homepage.](https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/studiopress.png)

Our last recommendation for where to buy premium themes is [StudioPress](https://wpmayor.com/link/studiopress/), home of the [Genesis Framework](https://wpmayor.com/link/genesis/). In addition to dozens of products developed in-house, this marketplace also offers several third-party tools for sale.

Each theme includes access to the Genesis Framework, as well as advanced customization options. These are excellent options for established blogs and brands, as well as developers who need to create unique client sites and still meet their deadlines.

The Genesis Framework is available for a one-time purchase of $59.95. Pricing goes up from there.
