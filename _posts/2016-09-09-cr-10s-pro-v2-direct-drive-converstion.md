> Restructured with back plate clip, and front clip, a little loose but much better than before, removed cable tie bracket as it did no good due to the forward cables i needed the run across the stepper motor.
> 
> printed almost all kinds of material with this setup, TPU/PETG/PC/PET/ABS no problem especially with the TPU, word to the wise, if your having starting issues with it probably wrecked your filament, cut it off and try again…
> 
> if this is your first upgrade for the pro V2 replace that fan shroud quick

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
