Craig Wright to Judge: “bonded courier” gave me keys to Satoshi Nakamoto’s 1,100,111 bitcoins
=============================================================================================

If Craig Wright really is Satoshi Nakamoto, the documents he turned over in court today will prove it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Craig Wright [informed a judge today](https://modernconsensus.com/people/judge-to-craig-wright-put-up-or-shut-up/) that the “bonded courier” he has long claimed will bring him the keys to Satoshi Nakamoto’s fortune and the right to bear the bitcoin creators name has arrived.

Wright is being sued by the estate of his late partner, Dave Kleiman, for half of a cache of 1,100,111 bitcoins believed to haver been mined at the beginning of the Bitcoin blockchain by its creator, the pseudonymous Nakamoto.

In a [brief filing on Jan. 14](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.521536/gov.uscourts.flsd.521536.376.0_1.pdf), Wright’s attorney’s wrote: “Dr. Craig Wright files this Notice of Compliance with this Court’s Order dated January 10, 2020. Specifically, Dr. Wright notifies the Court that a third party has provided the necessary information and key slice to unlock the encrypted file, and Dr. Wright has produced a list of his bitcoin holdings, as ordered by the Magistrate Judge, to plaintiffs today.”

Wright’s claim to be Nakamoto has been widely denied, and one of the main arguments has been his inability to access this bitcoin cache. He has long claimed the private keys to those bitcoins were locked in an encrypted document known as the Tulip Trust. He said it would be returned to him by a “bonded courier” this month.
