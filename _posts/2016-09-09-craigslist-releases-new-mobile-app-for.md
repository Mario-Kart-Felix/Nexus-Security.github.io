> Finally a great app for Craigslist!  
>   
> Very slick interface. Searching is fast and flexible and it’s very easy to post an ad with your phone camera.  
>   
> One thing that took me awhile to notice: you can favorite and hide posts by sliding left. It’s very handy but easy not to notice.  
>   
> Also there is a very cool calendar picker when you search for garage sales. I like that a lot.  
>   
> My favorite search is cars and trucks, with model year < 1980. Browsing through that has gotten me through many a dull meeting. Also sailboats. I may even buy one someday.
