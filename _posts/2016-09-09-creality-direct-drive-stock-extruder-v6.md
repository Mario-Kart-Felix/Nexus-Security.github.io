> This is a direct drive solution that uses the stock Creality extruder and stepper motor. It is based around the already proven V6 Bowden version of this mount and uses an identical part cooling duct and BLTouch mount.
> 
> Parts print in the orientation in the file and without supports with the exception of the Main\_Mount that will require support from the build plate only to support the geometry on the back face.  
> Print parts with 4 walls and 17% infill. I’d suggest PETG or ABS for temperature resistance although people have successfully printed and used the bowden version in PLA.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
