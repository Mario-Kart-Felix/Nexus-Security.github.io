Brighten your winter with a NeoPixel Ring programmed with a realistic candle effect. [LuckyResistor built this project](https://luckyresistor.me/2019/11/25/candlelight-effect/) with an Adafruit Trinket M0 programmed in Arduino. There are several bonuses in the project too: a real-time clock to turn the effect on and off during predefined hours and a supercapacitor to power the clock in case of power loss.

> Here I briefly document a very realistic candlelight effect you can build with very few components. It works best if the device is placed in a jar or behind a screen, where the NeoPixel ring is not in direct sight.
> 
> You will find all the required information, schema and the firmware to build the device (in the guide).

The software for the effect is in [GitHub](https://github.com/LuckyResistor/CandleDecoration). There are effects for color adjustments and â€œair movement.

See [the guide](https://luckyresistor.me/2019/11/25/candlelight-effect/) for full details and the project in action in the [video](https://youtu.be/RbaMyXduGWA) above.
