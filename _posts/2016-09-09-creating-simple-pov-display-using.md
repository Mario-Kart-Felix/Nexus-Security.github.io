Carl Bugeja has been working on a cool project to create a simple persistence of vision (POV) display using LEDs mounted on a flexible PCB coil. Here is the current video update on the project.

You can see all of his design process and current progress on his [Hackster.io page](https://www.hackster.io/carlbugeja/flexled-v2-bf7b60).
