> Getting a DSLR camera close to the lathe is tricky. It’s hard to get it where the macro lens can see the work clearly, without blocking the operator’s view of what’s going on. I’ve invested in a few items that can help with this, but they all have their drawbacks. A camera jib works well, and can hang the camera right over the work without getting in the way, but it has a huge disadvantage, that it wobbles whenever it gets knocked. Not only does the wobble visually shake the frame, but when the machine tools are running, the vibration can cause interference effects that make the whole image do a dizzy dance that’s quite unsettling. Also, the jib is a huge pain to set up and put away.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
