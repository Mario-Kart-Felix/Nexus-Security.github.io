> Working together with drone services provider AIR-RMLD, Croatian Post has successfully completed its first drone delivery as part of a pilot project.
> 
> A drone flew autonomously from the Zadar port of Gaženica to Preko on the island of Ugljan at a speed of 35km/h, for about 12 minutes.
> 
> The drone has since successfully delivered parcels from Gaženica to Preko over a dozen times, also flying during heavy winds. The drone can carry loads of up to 200g, while flying completely autonomously on a pre-programmed route.
