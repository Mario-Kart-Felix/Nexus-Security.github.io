King of the JustTheTip Trumpers Rod Dreher, shortly after doing [one of his highly outraged Look What Trump Has Done _This_ Time posts](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/transcript-rudy-giuliani-secretary-of-state/), says good [conservatives should defend Trump because he's like Edwin Edwards](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/), because he's crooked but acceptable as opposed to "the Left" -- that is to say, Democrats including (I shit you not) Joe Biden, whom Dreher excoriates for his defense of "radical transgender rights" -- which is like David Duke, the Klansman Edwards defeated in the 1991 Louisiana governor's race:  

> It’s hard to express strongly enough how much both conservatives and good-government liberals despised Edwin Edwards. He was, and remains, a clever man, but also a symbol of good ol’ boy Louisiana political corruption. To find oneself in a position to have to vote for EWE because that was the only way to keep a Klucker out of the governor’s mansion was revolting. I can remember to this day standing in the voting booth and pulling the lever for Edwards — something I never, ever imagined doing.

I bet that's not to only time Dreher had to overcome his disgust before "pulling the lever."  

> As regular readers know, I did not vote in the 2016 presidential race (it didn’t matter; my state was heavily pro-Trump), but if I end up voting for Trump in 2020, it’ll be a VFTC:II thing.

"If I end up voting for Trump"? He must think his readers are awfully stupid. With good reason tho!  

> It’s easy to see how Trump is analogous to EWE (though unlike Trump, EWE was quite competent).

Oh for fuck's sake.  

> But how can the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates possibly be analogized in any way to David Duke?

A non-lunatic would have stopped there, balled up his laptop and thrown it in the trash. But not Dreher: He argues that even though "Duke’s political positions were mostly boilerplate Reagan conservatism... everybody knew that Duke was no ordinary Republican." (Boy, _there's_ a statement that could use some examination!) So many Republicans rebuffed him to avoid "mainstreaming a truly hateful figure."  
  
Of course, from my vantage point in 2019, it looks like mainstreaming a truly hateful figure is Republican strategy and David Duke -- [now an ardent Trump fan](https://www.vox.com/2017/8/12/16138358/charlottesville-protests-david-duke-kkk) -- was a prophet of the party's future. But Dreher says no, the Democrats are the Klansmen, because abortion and whatnot:  

> What about immigration? Am I happy with the way Trump has handled the immigration issue? No. But unlike Elizabeth Warren, his likely 2020 rival, he is not for open borders. Biden has been evasive on his immigration stance, but I have every confidence that he will move to the far left.

As a Christian, it's important to maintain the baby cages to prevent a Mexican from working at my local gas and go.  
  
Oh, and before we leave the topic I have to include some classic Dreherisms. To wit:  

> Remember Nina Burleigh? She’s the journalist who, back during the Clinton impeachment proceedings, said that she would fellate Clinton herself to thank him for preserving abortion rights. At the time, conservatives (including me) cited that as an example of how corrupt liberals were. Just look at that so-called feminist, carrying water for that dirtbag Bill Clinton! we said. Where are her morals now? 

> In retrospect, Burleigh was right... 

> Yeah, it was gross. But from a pro-choice feminist point of view, it was defensible. Trump has turned a lot of us into Nina Burleigh Conservatives.

Just close your eyes and think of the Rapture! On the other hand:  

> **UPDATE.2:** I’m struggling with this. I’m going to think out loud here for a minute.

It's 4 a.m. and he's still got his pants on. But when your date is Donald Trump, I imagine the idea is to hold out until he gets rough.
