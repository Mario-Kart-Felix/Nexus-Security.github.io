The [cryosphere](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/cryosphere.html) describes the regions of Earth where water freezes.

Adam [shared](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-send-a-blogtip-to-adafruit/) his [Cryologger](https://cryologger.org/) project for tracking and logging data in the crysophere! It is a super cool project utilizing some Adafruit parts:

> The Cryologger is a low-cost, open-source datalogger and telemeter based on the Arduino platform (www.arduino.cc) and built using easy-to-use, do-it- yourself electronics. Code for the Cryologger was written using the open-source Arduino integrated development environment (IDE) and compiled from community generated libraries.

You can [track](https://cryologger.org/tracking/) each logger and get tons of data. [Learn more!](https://cryologger.org/)
