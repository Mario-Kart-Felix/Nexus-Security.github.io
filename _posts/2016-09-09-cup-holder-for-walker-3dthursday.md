> This cup holder was made for a Dolomite walker. May fit other walkers as well if it has a strap that is 1/8 x 1-1/2″ (38 x 3.2mm). Assemble with 3 sheet metal screws #6 x 1/2″ (3.5 x 12mm). Two screws are installed from the outside (through the clip into the cup), one is installed from the inside (through the cup into the clip).

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
