Adafruit Holiday Shipping Deadlines 2019
----------------------------------------

Here are your 2019 shipping deadlines for ordering from Adafruit. Please review our [shipping section](https://www.adafruit.com/shippinginfo) if you have specific questions on how and where we ship worldwide for this holiday season.

The Adafruit Shipping Department works hard to get your orders out as quickly as we can, but once they’re in the hands of our carriers they’re out of our control. Carriers have been struggling to keep up with the sharp rise in online orders. UPS, FedEX, and USPS all experienced delivery delays over the last few years.

So all the Adafruit Shippers say: Please be sure you get your gifts early! Order as soon as you can! Once you place your order we’ll ship like the wind!
