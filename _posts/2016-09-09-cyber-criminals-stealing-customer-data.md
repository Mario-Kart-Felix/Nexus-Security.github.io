Kaspersky Lab experts described a recently discovered method of corporate phishing. Attackers send an employee or organization email inviting them to pass an assessment of knowledge and skills on the fake HR portal. To do this, the victim is asked to log in to the site using a working username and password. The potential victim has the impression that it is a mandatory procedure, for the successful passage of which he will receive a monetary reward.  
  
According to the senior content analyst of Kaspersky Lab Tatyana Shcherbakova, in this way, fraudsters get access to corporate mail, which may contain personal data of customers.  
  
Employees of large banks are regularly trained, tested and certified, so they can take a fake invitation for a real one. For this reason, the new phishing method threatens to take on a massive scale.  
  
According to analyst Anton Bykov, at the moment several thousand corporate accounts could already be hacked.  
  
Sergey Terekhov, director of the Technoserv information security competence center, noted that in this case, the employees of the credit departments of banks, in whose mailbox client profiles are stored, are in the risk zone.  
  
At the same time, Denis Kamzeev, head of the information security department of Raiffeisenbank, stressed that all emails in the financial institution are checked through anti-spam and anti-virus and blocked in case of suspicion.  
  
VTB, in turn, said that they delimit access to customer information for employees and keep records of employees who have access to confidential information.  
  
Arseniy Shcheltsin, CEO of Digital Platforms, noted that this type of social engineering is tied directly to a person, not to technology. "Therefore, regardless of security systems, a person can always give a login and password from the mail to attackers."
