A new Cold War will begin in the world in 2020, it will break out in cyberspace. Fake news before the elections will become an Internet trend in politics, and companies and ordinary people need to be wary of old threats - phishing and ransomware viruses. This forecast was made by Check Point IT company in a study available to the Russian Agency for International Information RIA Novosti.  
  
According to experts, cyber attacks will increasingly be used as indirect conflicts between small states, which are supported and financed by large countries seeking to expand their spheres of influence.  
  
In addition, they predict an increase in the number of cyber attacks on utility and other critical infrastructures, explaining this by the fact that in many cases outdated technologies are used in the field of electricity and water supply.  
  
In 2020, an increase in the number of targeted attacks on authorities, specific enterprises and healthcare organizations through mobile malware and ransomware is projected. According to the study, "new versions of malware are available to anyone willing to pay developers".  
  
Companies Check Point predicts more phishing against their employees. "Despite the fact that email remains the main attack vector, cybercriminals now use many other attack vectors. Phishing increasingly includes SMS attacks on mobile phones or the use of messages on social networks and gaming platforms," said experts.  
  
Another trend in 2020, according to the IT company, will be fake news during election campaigns. "In 2016, before the US presidential election, the distribution of fake news based on artificial intelligence began. Political opponents were successful by creating special teams that created and spread false stories," said IT company.
