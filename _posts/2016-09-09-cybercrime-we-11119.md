[Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) [tracked](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/10/28/cyberattacks-sporting-anti-doping/) new attacks linked to the Strontium (also known as Sofacy, Fancy Bear, and APT28) threat entity that focused on anti-doping authorities and sporting organizations around the world. At least 16 national and international sporting and anti-doping organizations across three continents were targeted in these attacks which began September 16.

[Lookout](https://www.lookout.com/) has [detected](https://blog.lookout.com/lookout-phishing-ai-discovers-phishing-attack-targeting-humanitarian-organizations) a mobile-aware phishing campaign targeting non-governmental organizations around the world, including a variety of United Nations humanitarian organizations, such as UNICEF.

**Researchers Dive into Hacking Forum to Learn More about Rig EK** (10/29/2019)  
While researching a malware sample spread by the Rig exploit kit (EK), the researchers at [Check Point Software](http://www.checkpoint.com/) were led to the HackForums underground market where they [learned](https://research.checkpoint.com/inside-the-hacking-community-market-reselling-rig-ek-services/) about the hacking community and the EK itself in some detail. The scientists discovered that a new hacker can easily start up a business after joining an underground forum and buying different cyber attack products. Additionally, Rig EK miscreants are actively reselling the exploitation service to different customers on different "flows" and providing them with a Rig public statistics link. This allows customers to re-resell this service to their own customers and distribute whatever variant they have.

  

**Steam Gamers Victimized by Fake, Yet Legitimate Looking Online Stores** (10/29/2019)  
A phishing scam targeting users of the Steam online gaming platform has spiked since June, the researchers at [Kaspersky](http://www.kaspersky.com/) [say](https://securelist.com/steam-powered-scammers/94553/). Attackers lure users to sites that mimic or copy online stores linked to Steam that sell in-game items. The fake resources are high-quality, making it difficult to distinguish them from the real thing.
