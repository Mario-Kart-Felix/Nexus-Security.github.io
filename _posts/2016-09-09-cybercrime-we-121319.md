**x-Apple Exec Alleges Company Accessed His iPhone Messages** (12/10/2019)  
The formation of a new start-up by a former [Apple](http://www.apple.com/) executive has instigated a legal challenge from Cupertino and counter charges of invasion of privacy. Gerard Williams, who had been responsible for all chip design for Apple's mobile devices, alleges that phone and text messages between him and other Apple employees were illegally collected by the company as it sought to prevent him from competing with the firm. Two of those employees later joined Williams in his new venture, Nuvia, which creates processors for data center servers. In August, Apple filed a lawsuit against Williams, alleging "breach of contract and breach of duty of loyalty," contending that he drew on his work creating iPhone and iPad chips to start his new company and recruited other engineers from Apple. In response, Williams claims that Apple compromised his iPhone messages to gather information about his business intentions. According to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/10/apple-accused-of-monitoring-employee-text-messages-in-lawsuit-against-ex-chip-exec.html), the filing against Apple notes, "To further intimidate any current Apple employee who might dare consider leaving Apple, Apple's complaint shows that it is monitoring and examining its employees' phone records and text messages, in a stunning and disquieting invasion of privacy."

A Nigerian citizen residing in Ghana has been extradited to stand trial for an indictment charging him with wire fraud, money laundering, computer fraud, and aggravated identity theft, according to the Justice Department ([DOJ](http://www.usdoj.gov/)).

This scheme, known as business-email compromise, caused hundreds of thousands in loss to companies and individuals in Memphis. Martins is also charged with perpetrating romance scams, fraudulent-check scams, gold-buying scams, advance-fee scams, and credit card scams.
