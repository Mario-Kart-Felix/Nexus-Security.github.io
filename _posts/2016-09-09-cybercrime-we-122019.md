**Momentum Botnet Ramps Up Activities with DoS Attacks** (12/16/2019)  
Malicious activity targeting the Linux platform has been connected to the Momentum botnet in an effort to compromise devices and perform distributed denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Momentum targets the Linux platform on various CPU architectures such as ARM, MIPS, Intel, Motorola 68020, and more. The main purpose of this malware is to open a backdoor and accept commands to conduct various types of DoS attacks against a given target. The backdoors being distributed by the Momentum botnet are Mirai, Kaiten, and Bashlite variants. Momentum spreads via exploiting multiple vulnerabilities on various routers and Web services to download and execute shell scripts on the target devices. [Trend Micro](http://www.trendmicro.com/) has published its [analysis](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/ddos-attacks-and-iot-exploits-new-activity-from-momentum-botnet/) of Momentum.
