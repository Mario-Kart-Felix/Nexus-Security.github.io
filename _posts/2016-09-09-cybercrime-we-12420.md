**Feds Seize Domain for Hacked Personal Data Site WeLeakInfo.com** (01/22/2020)  
The [FBI](http://www.fbi.gov/) and the Department of Justice ([DOJ](http://www.usdoj.gov/)) seized the Internet domain name WeLeakInfo.com, a Web site that claimed to provide its users a search engine to review and obtain the personal information illegally obtained in over 10,000 data breaches and containing over 12 billion indexed records. That data included names, email addresses, usernames, phone numbers, and passwords for online accounts. The site sold subscriptions so that any user could access the results of these data breaches. WeLeakInfo.com is now in the custody of the federal government and its operations have been suspended.

  

**Job Seekers Be Wary of Job Listings - Some Are Fake** (01/22/2020)  
The Internet Crime Complaint Center ([IC3](http://www.ic3.gov/)) posted an [alert](https://www.ic3.gov/media/2020/200121.aspx) warning that cybercriminals are using fake job listings to target victims, resulting in the theft of personal information. Criminals first spoof a legitimate company's Web site by creating a domain name similar in appearance to a legitimate company. Then they post fake job openings on popular job boards that direct applicants to the spoofed sites. Applicants unknowingly apply to the fake jobs and give up their information when the cyber thieves contact them and ask them to sign employment contracts.

  

**Vivin Threat Actor Uses Different Wallet Addresses to Mine Monero** (01/23/2020)  
Vivin, a threat actor [identified](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/01/vivin-cryptomining-campaigns.html) by [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com/), is conducting cryptomining campaigns that have siphoned thousands of dollars in Monero from infected hosts. Vivin rotates the use of multiple cryptocurrency wallet addresses and alters the delivery chain of its payloads over different time periods of activity. The actor uses modified pirated software as its initial attack vector before the samples move on to common "living-off-the-land" methods at later stages of the attack. Cisco determined that Vivin has been active since at least November 2017.
