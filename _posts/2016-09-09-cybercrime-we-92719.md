The links led to code designed to exploit Web browser vulnerabilities to install spyware on iOS and Android devices, and in some cases to OAuth phishing pages.

US military veterans are being targeted by the Tortoiseshell threat actor via a fake Web site, [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com/) has [confirmed](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/09/tortoiseshell-fake-veterans.html#more). The threat group deployed a Web site designed to help US military vets find job and the site looked close to a legitimate service offered by the Department of [Commerce](http://www.commercebank.com/).

**Windows Users Exploited by PcShare Backdoor Attacks** (09/25/2019)  
A suspected Chinese advanced persistent threat group is [conducting](https://threatvector.cylance.com/en_us/home/pcshare-backdoor-attacks-targeting-windows-users-with-fakenarrator-malware.html) attacks against technology companies located in Southeast Asia. The threat actors deployed a modified version of the Chinese open-source backdoor called PcShare, which is designed to operate when side-loaded by a legitimate NVIDIA application. According to [BlackBerry Cylance](https://www.cylance.com/en-us/), the attackers also deploy a Trojanized screen reader application, replacing the built-in Narrator "Ease of Access" feature in Windows. This backdoor allows them to surreptitiously control systems via remote desktop logon screens without the need for credentials.

  

**xHunt Threat Activity Takes Aim at Kuwaiti Transportation Sector** (09/24/2019)  
Between May and June, [Palo Alto Networks](http://www.paloaltonetworks.com/) [observed](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/xhunt-campaign-attacks-on-kuwait-shipping-and-transportation-organizations/) previously unknown malicious tools used in the targeting of transportation and shipping organizations based in Kuwait. The activity has been dubbed "xHunt" because the threat actor named the tools after character names from the anime series Hunter x Hunter. These tools use HTTP for their command and control (C2) channels and certain variants use DNS tunneling or emails to communicate with the C2 as well. It is likely that this campaign is related to a similar one [documented](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/collection/Suspected-Iranian-Threat-Actor-Campaign-Targeting-Kuwaiti-Entities-04abb9338fef57ce9ecdec1c81d73865) by [IBM](http://www.ibm.com/) in 2018.
