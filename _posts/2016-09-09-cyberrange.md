**CyberRange - The Open-Source AWS Cyber Range**

  

  
This CyberRange project represents the first open-source Cyber Range blueprint in the world.  
This project provides a bootstrap framework for a complete offensive, defensive, reverse engineering, & security [intelligence](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Intelligence "intelligence") tooling in a private research lab using the AWS Cloud.  
This project contains vulnerable systems and a toolkit of the most powerful open-source / community edition tools known to Penetration testers.  
It simply provides a researcher with a disposable offensive / defensive AWS-based environment in less than 5 minutes.

**Domains of knowledge**  
This open-source research lab provides a bootstrap learning platform for Technologists studying any one of the "Big-3" technology skills.

1.  Cyber Security
2.  Cloud Computing
3.  DevOps

This project supports 7 gigantically broad domains of technical knowledge.

1.  Offensive Security
2.  SecDevOps
3.  Architecture & Engineering
4.  Vulnerability, Change, & Configuration Management
5.  Quality Assurance
6.  Auditing - Processing, Systems, Applications
7.  Development - Infrastructure / Web Applications

  
**Mission Statement**  
The ultimate expectation is to emulate the quality, format, and presentation of the [Syracuse University Cyber SEED Labs](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs_16.04/ "Syracuse University Cyber SEED Labs") while creating strategic hubs of Cyber Security Center-of-Excellence Partnerships where the gap between enterprise experience & academic learning is addressed by focusing training paths on people, products, and process.  
  
**SEED Funding / Training Programs**  
[AWS Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/ "AWS Educate") - Free cloud training for students w/ edu address  
[AWS EdStart](https://aws.amazon.com/education/edstart/ "AWS EdStart") - $500 in AWS Credits for startup's  
[Program Solicitation NSF 17-573](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2017/nsf17573/nsf17573.htm "Program Solicitation NSF 17-573") aims to make advancements in informal STEM learning.  
[Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP)](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19590/nsf19590.htm "Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP)") - SU's Master of Cyber Security program requires a bit more funding, this is opensource - win,win,win.  
  
[America's Seed Fund](https://seedfund.nsf.gov/ "America's Seed Fund") - a creative outlet
