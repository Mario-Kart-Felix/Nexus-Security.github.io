> The sci-fi podcast Carrier is heading to the big screen! Deadline reports that Cynthia Erivo will be reprising her role as Raylene in a film adaptation of the podcast, which she will also produce.

> According to Deadline, Carrier creator Dan Blank will write and direct. This will be audio studio QCode’s first feature film adaptation, reports the outlet, although more “pod-to-screen adaptations” are currently in development. There’s no word on what those might be, but QCode’s current line-up of shows include the Rami Malek-starring Blackout, about a nation-wide blackout, and The Edge of Sleep, about a global epidemic where sleep causes death.
