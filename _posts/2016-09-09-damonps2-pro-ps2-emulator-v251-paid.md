To speed up the development of the DamonPS2 Emulator, we need more money and hire more developers. So, After the paid version downloads more than 50,000, we will provide free version to the player to download. In terms of game ROM compatibility, the paid version and the free version will be the same. But the paid version will continue to own and increase the exclusive features that distinguish it from the free version. After more than 80 million downloads from Google Play’s free version, we will try to open source gradually. As developers in China, contribute to the word’s console emulator open source community.  
  
We want to create a smooth PS2 emulator as PPSSPP!!!!! But ……, We found in the test, PS2 original machine peak performance is 2 times the peak performance of the original PSP machine.So theoretically, any PS2 emulator needs twice the hardware performance of a PSP emulator if you want to run the game smoothly. In other words, if your PPSSPP Emulator can run the game full frame, then the DamonPS2 emulator game may be running only half the frame rate of full frame.And, because the PS2 original machine uses some techniques to prevent frame skipping, DamonPS2 can not jump frame like PPSSPP.
