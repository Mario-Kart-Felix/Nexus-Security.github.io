A novel story inward issues _Skim of Side Research_ argues {that a} ms translation of Tacitus's Annales, accomplished inward issues belatedly sixteenth hundred and preserved astatine Lambeth Castle Bibliotheca, was through past Queen Elizabeth I.  

  
  

  
  

  

Issues story analyzes issues [translation](https://phys.org/tags/translation/)'s paper inventory, type, and crucially issues hand preserved inward issues ms to positively place Elizabeth I equally issues translation's writer. Researchers hither likewise line issues ms's transmission from issues Elizabethan Courtroom to issues Lambeth Castle Bibliotheca, by way of issues assortment of Archbishop Thomas Tenison inward issues seventeenth hundred.
