> “My love of knitting also started early but it is only recently that I began creating my own designs and considering the possibilities and constraints of hand-knits as an artistic medium.”
> 
> “In 2017, I became concerned by the devaluation of science and data by our leadership and some of the public. I feel strongly that decisions at all levels are best made when relevant data are considered. My response was to develop a novel approach to telling the stories of science. I work with the tension between hard science and a traditional hand craft with familiar positive associations: hand-knitting.”
