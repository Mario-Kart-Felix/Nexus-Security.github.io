> Designed by a very talented game designer friend of mine, this beautiful day of the dead mask will suit any day of the dead festival ! decorate as you please, wear with pride and show off to all family and friends.
> 
> This design features a head and separate jaw that can be brought together with a hinging mechanism of your choice, providing you with a dynamic mask design to wow anyone and all. The files of the mask are rather large and I found that printing the mask at 60% scale allowed for a perfect fit for a head size that has an ear to ear dimension of 170mm and a chin to top of head dimension of 250mm.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And donâ€™t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
