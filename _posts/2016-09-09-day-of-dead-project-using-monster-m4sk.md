From the Adafruit Forums, user kwalkery posts a [Day of the Dead Photo/Frame](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=59&t=156998#p774136)

This is a great project for using the new Adafruit Monster M4sk which also comes in Adabox 013.

The [Monster M4sk](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4343) is currently out of stock but there are a few dozen [Adabox 013](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4281) available in the Adafruit store.
