A state in which risks associated with aviation are at an acceptable level

**Aviation safety** means the state of an aviation system or organization in which risks associated with aviation activities, related to, or in direct support of the operation of aircraft, are reduced and controlled to an acceptable level. It encompasses the theory, practice, investigation, and [categorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization "Categorization") of [flight failures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_accidents_and_incidents "Aviation accidents and incidents"), and the prevention of such failures through regulation, education, and training. It can also be applied in the context of campaigns that inform the public as to the safety of [air travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_travel "Air travel").

Yearly fatalities

[\[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-1)

since 1942, 5-year average in red: fatalities peaked in 1972.

[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-2)

In 1926 and 1927 there were a total of 24 fatal commercial airline crashes, a further 16 in 1928, and 51 in 1929 (killing 61 people), which remains the worst year on record at an accident rate of about 1 for every 1,000,000 miles (1,600,000 km) flown.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] Based on the current numbers flying, this would equate to 7,000 fatal incidents per year.

For the ten-year period 2002 to 2011, 0.6 fatal accidents happened per one million flights globally, 0.4 per million hours flown, 22.0 fatalities per one million flights or 12.7 per million hours flown.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-3)

From 310 million passengers in 1970, air transport had grown to 3,696 million in 2016, led by 823 million in the United States then 488 million in China.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-4) In 2016, there were 19 fatal accidents of civil airliners of more than 14 passengers, resulting in 325 fatalities : the second safest year ever after 2015 with 16 accidents and 2013 with 265 fatalities.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-5) For planes heavier than 5.7 t, there were 34.9 million departures and 75 accidents worldwide with 7 of these fatal for 182 fatalities, the lowest since 2013 : 5.21 fatalities per million departures.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-ICAO-6)

In 2017 there were 10 fatal airliner accidents, resulting in 44 occupant fatalities and 35 persons on the ground: the safest year ever for commercial aviation, both by the number of fatal accidents as well as in fatalities.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-7) By 2018, fatal accidents per million flights decreased 16 fold since 1970, from 6.35 to 0.39, and fatalities per trillion [revenue passenger kilometre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_passenger_kilometre "Revenue passenger kilometre") (RPK) decreased 54 fold from 3,218 to 59.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-8)

### Typology

Runway safety represents 36% of accidents, Ground Safety 18% and Loss of Control in-Flight 16%.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-ICAO-6)

The main cause is Pilot in Command error.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] Safety has improved from better [aircraft design process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_design_process "Aircraft design process"), engineering and maintenance, the evolution of navigation aids, and safety protocols and procedures.

### Transport comparisons

There are three main ways in which risk of fatality of a certain mode of travel can be measured: Deaths per billion typical _journeys_ taken, deaths per billion _hours_ traveled, or deaths per billion _kilometers_ traveled. The following table displays these statistics for the United Kingdom 1990–2000. Note that aviation safety does not include the transportation to the airport.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-9)[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-10)

The first two statistics are computed for typical travels for respective forms of transport, so they cannot be used directly to compare risks related to different forms of transport in a particular travel "from A to B". For example: according to statistics, a typical flight from [Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles "Los Angeles") to [New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City") will carry a larger risk factor than a typical car travel from home to office. But a car travel from Los Angeles to New York would not be typical. It would be as large as several dozens of typical car travels, and associated risk will be larger as well. Because the journey would take a much longer time, the overall risk associated by making this journey by car will be higher than making the same journey by air, even if each individual hour of car travel can be less risky than an hour of flight.

It is therefore important to use each statistic in a proper context. When it comes to a question about risks associated with a particular long-range travel from one city to another, the most suitable statistic is the third one, thus giving a reason to name air travel as the safest form of long-range transportation. However, if the availability of an air option makes an otherwise inconvenient journey possible, then this argument loses some of its force.

Aviation industry insurers base their calculations on the _deaths per journey_ statistic while the aviation industry itself generally uses the _deaths per kilometre_ statistic in press releases.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-15)

Since 1997 the number of fatal air accidents has been no more than 1 for every 2,000,000,000 person-miles flown\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] (e.g., 100 people flying a plane for 1,000 miles (1,600 km) counts as 100,000 person-miles, making it comparable with methods of transportation with different numbers of passengers, such as one person driving an [automobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile "Automobile") for 100,000 miles (160,000 km), which is also 100,000 person-miles), and thus one of the safest modes of transportation when measured by [distance traveled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_miles "Passenger miles").

The death per billion hours when skydiving assume a 6 minutes skydive (not accounting for the plane ascent). The death per billion journey when paragliding assume an average flight of 15 minutes, so 4 flights per hour.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-16)

### United States

Between 1990 and 2015, there were 1874 commuter and [air taxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_taxi "Air taxi") accidents in the U.S. of which 454 (24%) were fatal, resulting in 1296 deaths, including 674 accidents (36%) and 279 fatalities (22%) in Alaska alone.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-17)

The number of deaths per passenger-mile on commercial airlines in the United States between 2000 and 2010 was about 0.2 deaths per 10 billion passenger-miles.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-18)[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-19) For driving, the rate was 150 per 10 billion vehicle-miles for 2000 : 750 times higher per mile than for flying in a commercial airplane.

There were no fatalities on large scheduled commercial airlines in the United States for over nine years, between the [Colgan Air Flight 3407](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colgan_Air_Flight_3407 "Colgan Air Flight 3407") crash in February 2009, and a catastrophic engine failure on [Southwest Airlines Flight 1380](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines_Flight_1380 "Southwest Airlines Flight 1380") in April 2018.[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-20)

### Security

Another aspect of safety is protection from intentional harm or [property damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_damage "Property damage"), also known as _security_.

The [terrorist attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11,_2001_attacks "September 11, 2001 attacks") of 2001 are not counted as accidents. However, even if they were counted as accidents they would have added about 2 deaths per 2,000,000,000 person-miles. Two months later, [American Airlines Flight 587](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_587 "American Airlines Flight 587") crashed in New York City, killing 256 people including 5 on the ground, causing 2001 to show a very high fatality rate. Even so, the rate that year including the attacks (estimated here to be about 4 deaths per 1,000,000,000 person-miles), is safe compared to some other forms of transport when measured by distance traveled.

History
-------

### Before WWII

The first aircraft electrical or electronic device [avionics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avionics "Avionics") system was [Lawrence Sperry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Sperry "Lawrence Sperry")’s [autopilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopilot "Autopilot"), demonstrated in June 1914. The [Transcontinental Airway System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcontinental_Airway_System "Transcontinental Airway System") chain of beacons was built by the [Commerce Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Department "Commerce Department") in 1923 to guide [airmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airmail "Airmail") flights. [Gyrocopters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrocopters "Gyrocopters") were developed by [Juan de la Cierva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_de_la_Cierva "Juan de la Cierva") to avoid [stall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamic_stall "Aerodynamic stall") and [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(aircraft) "Spin (aircraft)") accidents, and for that invented [cyclic and collective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_and_collective "Cyclic and collective") controls used by [helicopters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter "Helicopter").[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-AvWeek1Aug2017-21) It first flew on 17 January 1923.

During the 1920s, the first laws were passed in the USA to regulate [civil aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_aviation "Civil aviation"), notably the [Air Commerce Act of 1926](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Commerce_Act_of_1926 "Air Commerce Act of 1926") which required pilots and aircraft to be examined and licensed, for accidents to be properly investigated, and for the establishment of safety rules and navigation aids, under the Aeronautics Branch of the [United States Department of Commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce "United States Department of Commerce").

A network of [aerial lighthouses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_lighthouse "Aerial lighthouse") was established in the United Kingdom and Europe during the 1920s and 1930s. Use of the lighthouses has declined with the advent of radio navigation aids such as NDB (non-directional beacon), VOR (VHF omnidirectional ranging) and DME (distance measuring equipment). The last operational aerial lighthouse in the United Kingdom is on top of the cupola over the RAF College main hall at RAF Cranwell.

One of the first aids for [air navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_navigation "Air navigation") to be introduced in the USA in the late 1920s was [airfield lighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approach_lighting_system "Approach lighting system") to assist pilots to make landings in poor weather or after dark. The [Precision Approach Path Indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_Approach_Path_Indicator "Precision Approach Path Indicator") was developed from this in the 1930s, indicating to the pilot the angle of descent to the airfield. This later became adopted internationally through the standards of the [International Civil Aviation Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Civil_Aviation_Organization "International Civil Aviation Organization") (ICAO).

[Jimmy Doolittle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Doolittle "Jimmy Doolittle") developed [Instrument rating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_rating "Instrument rating") and made his first “blind” flight in September 1929. The March 1931 wooden wing failure of [a Transcontinental & Western Air Fokker F-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1931_Transcontinental_%26_Western_Air_Fokker_F-10_crash "1931 Transcontinental & Western Air Fokker F-10 crash") carrying [Knute Rockne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knute_Rockne "Knute Rockne"), coach of the [University of Notre Dame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame "University of Notre Dame")’s football team, reinforced all-metal [airframes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airframe "Airframe") and led to a more formal [accident investigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident_investigation "Accident investigation") system. On Sept. 4, 1933, a [Douglas DC-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_DC-1 "Douglas DC-1") test flight was conducted with one of the two engines shut down during the takeoff run, climbed to 8,000 feet (2,400 m), and completed its flight, proving twin [aircraft engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_engine "Aircraft engine") safety. With greater range than lights and weather immunity, [radio navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_navigation "Radio navigation") aids were first used in the 1930s, like the Australian [Aeradio stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aeradio_station&action=edit&redlink=1 "Aeradio station (page does not exist)") guiding transport flights, with a light beacon and a modified [Lorenz beam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_beam "Lorenz beam") transmitter (the German blind-landing equipment preceding the modern [instrument landing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_landing_system "Instrument landing system") - ILS).[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-AvWeek1Aug2017-21) ILS was first used by a scheduled flight to make a landing in a snowstorm at [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"), in 1938, and a form of ILS was adopted by the ICAO for international use in 1949.

### WWII and later

Hard [runways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway "Runway") were built worldwide for World War II to avoid waves and floating hazards plaguing [seaplanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaplane "Seaplane").[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-AvWeek1Aug2017-21) Developed by the U.S. and introduced during World War II, [LORAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LORAN "LORAN") replaced the sailors' less reliable [compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass "Compass") and [celestial navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_navigation "Celestial navigation") over water and survived until it was replaced by the [Global Positioning System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System "Global Positioning System").[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-AvWeek1Aug2017-21)

Following the development of [Radar in World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_in_World_War_II "Radar in World War II"), it was deployed as a landing aid for civil aviation in the form of [ground-controlled approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground-controlled_approach "Ground-controlled approach") (GCA) systems then as the [airport surveillance radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_surveillance_radar "Airport surveillance radar") as an aid to [air traffic control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_control "Air traffic control") in the 1950s. A number of ground-based [Weather radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_radar "Weather radar") systems can detect areas of severe turbulence. A modern [Honeywell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeywell_Aerospace "Honeywell Aerospace") Intuvue weather system visualizes weather patterns up to 300 miles (480 km) away.

[Distance measuring equipment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_measuring_equipment "Distance measuring equipment") (DME) in 1948 and [VHF omnidirectional range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHF_omnidirectional_range "VHF omnidirectional range") (VOR) stations became the main route navigation means during the 1960s, superseding the low frequency radio ranges and the [non-directional beacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-directional_beacon "Non-directional beacon") (NDB): the ground-based VOR stations were often co-located with DME transmitters and the pilots could establish their bearing and distance to the station.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

With the arrival of [Wide Area Augmentation System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Area_Augmentation_System "Wide Area Augmentation System") (WAAS), satellite navigation has become accurate enough for altitude as well as positioning use, and is being used increasingly for instrument approaches as well as en-route navigation. However, because the GPS constellation is a [single point of failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure "Single point of failure"), on-board [Inertial Navigation System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_Navigation_System "Inertial Navigation System") (INS) or ground-based navigation aids are still required for backup.

[Rockwell Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_Collins "Rockwell Collins") reports it costs more to certify than to develop a system, from 75% engineering and 25% certification in past years.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-22) It calls for a global harmonization between certifying authorities to avoid redundant engineering and certification tests rather than recognizing the others approval and validation.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-23)

Groundings of entire classes of aircraft out of equipment safety concerns is unusual, but this has occurred to the [de Havilland Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Comet "De Havilland Comet") in 1954 after multiple crashes due to metal fatigue and hull failure, the [McDonnell Douglas DC-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-10 "McDonnell Douglas DC-10") in 1979 after the crash of [American Airlines Flight 191](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_191 "American Airlines Flight 191") due to engine loss, the [Boeing 787 Dreamliner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner "Boeing 787 Dreamliner") in 2013 after its [battery problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner_battery_problems "Boeing 787 Dreamliner battery problems"), and the [Boeing 737 MAX in 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX_groundings "Boeing 737 MAX groundings") after two crashes preliminarily tied to a flight control system.

Aviation safety hazards
-----------------------

### Foreign object debris

Foreign object debris (FOD) includes items left in the aircraft structure during manufacture/repairs, debris on the runway and solids encountered in flight (e.g. hail and dust). Such items can damage engines and other parts of the aircraft. [Air France Flight 4590](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_4590 "Air France Flight 4590") crashed after hitting a part that had fallen from another aircraft.

### Misleading information and lack of information

A pilot misinformed by a printed document (manual, map, etc.), reacting to a faulty instrument or indicator (in the cockpit or on the ground),[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-24)[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-25) or following inaccurate instructions or information from flight or ground control can lose [spatial orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_disorientation "Spatial disorientation"), or make another mistake, and consequently lead to accidents or near misses.[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-26)[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-27)[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-28)[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-29). Misleading information and lack of information is a major contributor to accidents and incidents.\[_[importance?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Encyclopedic_content "Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not")_\]

### Lightning

Boeing studies showed that airliners are struck by [lightning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning "Lightning") twice per year on average; aircraft withstand typical lightning strikes without damage.

The dangers of more powerful [positive lightning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning#positive "Lightning") were not understood until the destruction of a [glider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_(sailplane) "Glider (sailplane)") in 1999.[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-schleicher-30) It has since been suggested that positive lightning might have caused the crash of [Pan Am](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_American_World_Airways "Pan American World Airways") [Flight 214](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am_Flight_214 "Pan Am Flight 214") in 1963. At that time, aircraft were not designed to withstand such strikes because their existence was unknown. The 1985 standard in force in the US at the time of the glider crash, Advisory Circular AC 20-53A,[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-schleicher-30) was replaced by Advisory Circular AC 20-53B in 2006.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-31) However, it is unclear whether adequate protection against positive lightning was incorporated.[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-32)[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-33)

The effects of typical lightning on traditional metal-covered aircraft are well understood and serious damage from a lightning strike on an airplane is rare. The [Boeing 787 Dreamliner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner "Boeing 787 Dreamliner") of which the exterior is [carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-fiber-reinforced_polymer "Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer") received no damage from a lightning strike during testing.[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-www.wired.com-34)

### Ice and snow

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Boeing_747-400_%28British_Airways%29_%285282775118%29.jpg/220px-Boeing_747-400_%28British_Airways%29_%285282775118%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Boeing_747-400_(British_Airways)_(5282775118).jpg)

[Snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow "Snow")

building on the intake to a

[Rolls-Royce RB211](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_RB211 "Rolls-Royce RB211")

engine of a

[Boeing 747-400](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747-400 "Boeing 747-400")

. Snow and ice present unique threats, and aircraft operating in these weather conditions often require de-icing equipment.

Ice and [snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow "Snow") can be major factors in airline accidents. In 2005, [Southwest Airlines Flight 1248](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines_Flight_1248 "Southwest Airlines Flight 1248") slid off the end of a [runway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway "Runway") after landing in heavy snow conditions, killing one child on the ground.

Even a small amount of [icing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_icing "Atmospheric icing") or coarse [frost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost "Frost") can greatly impair the ability of a wing to develop adequate [lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(force) "Lift (force)"), which is why regulations prohibit ice, snow or even frost on the wings or tail, prior to takeoff.[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-35)[Air Florida Flight 90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Florida_Flight_90 "Air Florida Flight 90") crashed on takeoff in 1982, as a result of ice/snow on its wings.

An accumulation of ice during flight can be catastrophic, as evidenced by the loss of control and subsequent crashes of [American Eagle Flight 4184](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Eagle_Flight_4184 "American Eagle Flight 4184") in 1994, and [Comair Flight 3272](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comair_Flight_3272 "Comair Flight 3272") in 1997. Both aircraft were [turboprop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turboprop "Turboprop") airliners, with straight wings, which tend to be more susceptible to inflight ice accumulation, than are swept-wing jet airliners.[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-36)

Airlines and airports ensure that aircraft are properly [de-iced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deicing "Deicing") before [takeoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff "Takeoff") whenever the weather involves [icing conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icing_conditions "Icing conditions"). Modern airliners are designed to prevent ice buildup on [wings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing "Wing"), [engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_engine "Aircraft engine"), and tails ([empennage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empennage "Empennage")) by either routing heated air from [jet engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_engine "Jet engine") through the [leading edges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_edge "Leading edge") of the wing, and inlets\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\], or on slower aircraft, by use of inflatable rubber "[boots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deicing_boot "Deicing boot")" that expand to break off any accumulated ice.

Airline flight plans require [airline dispatch offices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_dispatcher "Flight dispatcher") to monitor the progress of weather along the routes of their flights, helping the [pilots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviator "Aviator") to avoid the worst of inflight icing conditions. Aircraft can also be equipped with an [ice detector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_detector "Ice detector") in order to warn pilots to leave unexpected ice accumulation areas, before the situation becomes critical.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\][Pitot tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitot_tube "Pitot tube") in modern airplanes and helicopters have been provided with the function of "Pitot Heating" to prevent accidents like [Air France Flight 447](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_447 "Air France Flight 447") caused by the pitot tube freezing and giving false readings.

### Wind shear or microburst

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Windshearaircraftnasa.gif/200px-Windshearaircraftnasa.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Windshearaircraftnasa.gif)

Effect of wind shear on aircraft trajectory. Note how merely correcting for the initial gust front can have dire consequences.

A [wind shear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_shear "Wind shear") is a change in wind speed and/or direction over a relatively short distance in the atmosphere. A [microburst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microburst "Microburst") is a localized column of sinking air that drops down in a thunderstorm. Both of these are potential weather threats that may cause an aviation accident.[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-Shiavo-37)

Strong outflow from thunderstorms causes rapid changes in the three-dimensional wind velocity just above ground level. Initially, this outflow causes a headwind that increases airspeed, which normally causes a pilot to reduce engine power if they are unaware of the wind shear. As the aircraft passes into the region of the downdraft, the localized headwind diminishes, reducing the aircraft's airspeed and increasing its sink rate. Then, when the aircraft passes through the other side of the downdraft, the headwind becomes a tailwind, reducing lift generated by the wings, and leaving the aircraft in a low-power, low-speed descent. This can lead to an accident if the aircraft is too low to effect a recovery before ground contact. Between 1964 and 1985, wind shear directly caused or contributed to 26 major civil transport aircraft accidents in the U.S. that led to 620 deaths and 200 injuries.[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-National_Aeronautics_and_Space_Administration,_Langley_Research_Center-38)

### Engine failure

An engine may fail to function because of [fuel starvation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_starvation "Fuel starvation") (e.g. [British Airways Flight 38](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways_Flight_38 "British Airways Flight 38")), [fuel exhaustion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_exhaustion "Fuel exhaustion") (e.g. [Air Canada Flight 143](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimli_Glider "Gimli Glider")), [foreign object damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_object_damage "Foreign object damage") (e.g. [US Airways Flight 1549](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Airways_Flight_1549 "US Airways Flight 1549")), mechanical failure due to [metal fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_fatigue "Metal fatigue") (e.g. [Kegworth air disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kegworth_air_disaster "Kegworth air disaster"), [El Al Flight 1862](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Al_Flight_1862 "El Al Flight 1862"), [China Airlines Flight 358](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Airlines_Flight_358 "China Airlines Flight 358")), mechanical failure due to improper maintenance (e.g. [American Airlines Flight 191](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_191 "American Airlines Flight 191")), mechanical failure caused by an original manufacturing defect in the engine (e.g. [Qantas Flight 32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qantas_Flight_32 "Qantas Flight 32"), [United Airlines Flight 232](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_232 "United Airlines Flight 232"), [Delta Air Lines Flight 1288](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines_Flight_1288 "Delta Air Lines Flight 1288")), and pilot error (e.g. [Pinnacle Airlines Flight 3701](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinnacle_Airlines_Flight_3701 "Pinnacle Airlines Flight 3701")).

In a multi-engine aircraft, failure of a single engine usually results in a precautionary landing being performed, for example landing at a [diversion airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversion_airport "Diversion airport") instead of continuing to the intended destination. Failure of a second engine (e.g. [US Airways Flight 1549](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Airways_Flight_1549 "US Airways Flight 1549")) or damage to other aircraft systems caused by an uncontained engine failure (e.g. [United Airlines Flight 232](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_232 "United Airlines Flight 232")) may, if an [emergency landing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_landing "Emergency landing") is not possible, result in the aircraft crashing.

### Structural failure of the aircraft

Examples of failure of aircraft structures caused by [metal fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(material) "Fatigue (material)") include the [de Havilland Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Comet "De Havilland Comet") accidents (1950s) and [Aloha Airlines Flight 243](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloha_Airlines_Flight_243 "Aloha Airlines Flight 243") (1988). Improper repair procedures can also cause structural failures include [Japan Airlines Flight 123](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Airlines_Flight_123 "Japan Airlines Flight 123") (1985) and [China Airlines Flight 611](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Airlines_Flight_611 "China Airlines Flight 611") (2002). Now that the subject is better understood, rigorous inspection and [nondestructive testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondestructive_testing "Nondestructive testing") procedures are in place.

[Composite materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material "Composite material") consist of layers of [fibers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber "Fiber") embedded in a [resin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resin "Resin") matrix. In some cases, especially when subjected to [cyclic stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_stress "Cyclic stress"), the layers of the material separate from each other ([delaminate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delamination "Delamination")) and lose strength. As the failure develops inside the material, nothing is shown on the surface; instrument methods (often [ultrasound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound "Ultrasound")\-based) have to be used to detect such a material failure. In the 1940s several [Yakovlev Yak-9s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakovlev_Yak-9 "Yakovlev Yak-9") experienced delamination of [plywood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plywood "Plywood") in their construction.

### Stalling

[Stalling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stall_(flight) "Stall (flight)") an aircraft (increasing the [angle of attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_attack "Angle of attack") to a point at which the wings fail to produce enough [lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(force) "Lift (force)")) is dangerous and can result in a crash if the pilot fails to make a timely correction.

Devices to warn the pilot when the aircraft's speed is decreasing close to the stall speed include stall warning horns (now standard on virtually all powered aircraft), [stick shakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stick_shaker "Stick shaker"), and voice warnings. Most stalls are a result of the pilot allowing the airspeed to be too slow for the particular weight and configuration at the time. Stall speed is higher when ice or frost has attached to the wings and/or tail stabilizer. The more severe the icing, the higher the stall speed, not only because smooth airflow over the wings becomes increasingly more difficult, but also because of the added weight of the accumulated ice.

Crashes caused by a full stall of the airfoils include:

Safety regulations control aircraft materials and the requirements for automated fire safety systems. Usually these requirements take the form of required tests. The tests measure [flammability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammability "Inflammability") of materials and [toxicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity "Toxicity") of [smoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke "Smoke"). When the tests fail, it is on a prototype in an engineering laboratory rather than in an aircraft.

Fire and its toxic smoke have been the cause of accidents. An electrical fire on [Air Canada Flight 797](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Canada_Flight_797 "Air Canada Flight 797") in 1983 caused the deaths of 23 of the 46 passengers, resulting in the introduction of floor level lighting to assist people to evacuate a smoke-filled aircraft. In 1985, a fire on the runway caused the loss of 55 lives, 48 from the effects of incapacitating and subsequently lethal toxic gas and smoke in the [British Airtours Flight 28M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airtours_Flight_28M "British Airtours Flight 28M") accident which raised serious concerns relating to survivability – something that had not been studied in such detail. The swift incursion of the fire into the fuselage and the layout of the aircraft impaired passengers' ability to evacuate, with areas such as the forward galley area becoming a bottle-neck for escaping passengers, with some dying very close to the exits. Much research into evacuation and cabin and seating layouts was carried out at [Cranfield Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranfield_Institute "Cranfield Institute") to try to measure what makes a good evacuation route, which led to the seat layout by [Overwing exits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwing_exits "Overwing exits") being changed by mandate and the examination of evacuation requirements relating to the design of galley areas. The use of [smoke hoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_hood "Smoke hood") or misting systems were also examined although both were rejected.

[South African Airways Flight 295](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Airways_Flight_295 "South African Airways Flight 295") was lost in the Indian Ocean in 1987 after an in-flight fire in the cargo hold could not be suppressed by the crew. The cargo holds of most airliners are now equipped with automated [halon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halomethane "Halomethane") fire extinguishing systems to combat a fire that might occur in the baggage holds. In May 1996, [ValuJet Flight 592](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ValuJet_Flight_592 "ValuJet Flight 592") crashed into the Florida [Everglades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everglades "Everglades") a few minutes after takeoff because of a fire in the forward cargo hold. All 110 people on board were killed.

At one time, fire fighting [foam paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foam_path "Foam path") were laid down before an emergency landing, but the practice was considered only marginally effective, and concerns about the depletion of fire fighting capability due to pre-foaming led the United States FAA to withdraw its recommendation in 1987.

One possible cause of fires in airplanes is wiring problems that involve intermittent faults, such as wires with breached insulation touching each other, having water dripping on them, or short circuits. Notable was [Swissair Flight 111](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swissair_Flight_111 "Swissair Flight 111") in 1998 due to an arc in the wiring of [IFE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflight_entertainment "Inflight entertainment") which ignite flammable [MPET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPET "MPET") insulation. These are difficult to detect once the aircraft is on the ground. However, there are methods, such as [spread-spectrum time-domain reflectometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread-spectrum_time-domain_reflectometry "Spread-spectrum time-domain reflectometry"), that can feasibly test live wires on aircraft during flight.[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-39)

### Bird strike

_Bird strike_ is an aviation term for a collision between a bird and an aircraft. Fatal accidents have been caused by both engine failure following bird ingestion and bird strikes breaking cockpit windshields.

Jet engines have to be designed to withstand the ingestion of birds of a specified weight and number and to not lose more than a specified amount of thrust. The weight and numbers of birds that can be ingested without hazarding the safe flight of the aircraft are related to the engine intake area.[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-40) The hazards of ingesting birds beyond the "designed-for" limit were shown on [US Airways Flight 1549](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Airways_Flight_1549 "US Airways Flight 1549") when the aircraft struck Canada geese.

The outcome of an ingestion event and whether it causes an accident, be it on a small fast plane, such as military jet fighters, or a large transport, depends on the number and weight of birds and where they strike the fan blade span or the nose cone. Core damage usually results with impacts near the blade root or on the nose cone.

The highest risk of a bird strike occurs during takeoff and [landing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing "Landing") in the vicinity of [airports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport "Airport"), and during low-level flying, for example by military aircraft, crop dusters and helicopters. Some airports use active countermeasures, including a person with a [shotgun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun "Shotgun"), playing recorded sounds of predators through loudspeakers, or employing [falconers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falconry "Falconry"). Poisonous grass can be planted that is not palatable to birds, nor to insects that attract [insectivorous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insectivore "Insectivore") birds. Passive countermeasures involve sensible\[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_\] land-use management, avoiding conditions attracting flocks of birds to the area (e.g. [landfills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill "Landfill")). Another tactic found effective is to let the grass at the airfield grow taller (to approximately 12 inches or 30 centimetres) as some species of birds won't land if they cannot see one another.

### Human factors

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/CID_slapdown.jpg/220px-CID_slapdown.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CID_slapdown.jpg)

NASA air safety experiment (

[CID project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Impact_Demonstration "Controlled Impact Demonstration")

). The airplane is a

[Boeing 720](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_720 "Boeing 720")

testing a form of jet fuel, known as "

[antimisting kerosene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimisting_kerosene "Antimisting kerosene")

", which formed a difficult-to-ignite gel when agitated violently, as in a crash.

[Human factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors "Human factors"), including [pilot error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_error "Pilot error"), are another potential set of factors, and currently the factor most commonly found in aviation accidents.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] Much progress in applying human factors analysis to improving aviation safety was made around the time of [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") by such pioneers as [Paul Fitts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Fitts "Paul Fitts") and [Alphonse Chapanis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonse_Chapanis "Alphonse Chapanis"). However, there has been progress in safety throughout the history of aviation, such as the development of the pilot's [checklist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checklist "Checklist") in 1937.[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-41) CRM, or [Crew Resource Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_Resource_Management "Crew Resource Management"), is a technique that makes use of the experience and knowledge of the complete flight crew to avoid dependence on just one crew member.

Pilot error and improper communication are often factors in the [collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision "Collision") of aircraft. This can take place [in the air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-air_collision "Mid-air collision") (1978 [Pacific Southwest Airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Southwest_Airlines "Pacific Southwest Airlines") [Flight 182](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSA_Flight_182 "PSA Flight 182")) ([TCAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCAS "TCAS")) or on the ground (1977 [Tenerife disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife_disaster "Tenerife disaster")) ([RAAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway_Awareness_and_Advisory_System "Runway Awareness and Advisory System")). The barriers to effective communication have internal and external factors.[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-42) The ability of the flight crew to maintain [situation awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_awareness "Situation awareness") is a critical human factor in air safety. Human factors training is available to general aviation pilots and called [single pilot resource management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_pilot_resource_management "Single pilot resource management") training.

Failure of the pilots to properly monitor the flight instruments caused the crash of [Eastern Air Lines Flight 401](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Air_Lines_Flight_401 "Eastern Air Lines Flight 401") in 1972. [Controlled flight into terrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_flight_into_terrain "Controlled flight into terrain") (CFIT), and error during take-off and landing can have catastrophic consequences, for example causing the crash of [Prinair Flight 191](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prinair_Flight_191 "Prinair Flight 191") on landing, also in 1972.

#### Pilot fatigue

The [International Civil Aviation Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Civil_Aviation_Organization "International Civil Aviation Organization") (ICAO) defines fatigue as "A physiological state of reduced mental or physical performance capability resulting from sleep loss or extended wakefulness, circadian phase, or workload."[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-43) The phenomenon places great risk on the crew and passengers of an airplane because it significantly increases the chance of [pilot error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_error "Pilot error").[\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-44) Fatigue is particularly prevalent among pilots because of "unpredictable work hours, long duty periods, [circadian disruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_dysrhythmia "Circadian dysrhythmia"), and insufficient sleep".[\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-:3-45) These factors can occur together to produce a combination of [sleep deprivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation "Sleep deprivation"), circadian rhythm effects, and 'time-on task' fatigue.[\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-:3-45) Regulators attempt to mitigate fatigue by limiting the number of hours pilots are allowed to fly over varying periods of time. Experts in aviation fatigue\[_[who?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch")_\] often find that these methods fall short of their goals.

#### Piloting while intoxicated

Rarely, flight crew members are arrested or subject to disciplinary action for being [intoxicated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication "Alcohol intoxication") on the job. In 1990, three [Northwest Airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Airlines "Northwest Airlines") crew members were sentenced to jail for flying while drunk. In 2001, Northwest fired a pilot who failed a [breathalyzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathalyzer "Breathalyzer") test after a flight. In July 2002, both pilots of [America West Airlines Flight 556](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_West_Airlines_Flight_556 "America West Airlines Flight 556") were arrested just before they were scheduled to fly because they had been drinking alcohol. The pilots were fired and the FAA revoked their pilot licenses.[\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-46) At least one fatal airliner accident involving drunk pilots occurred when [Aero Flight 311](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aero_Flight_311 "Aero Flight 311") crashed at Koivulahti, Finland, killing all 25 on board in 1961, which underscores the role that poor human choices can play in air accidents.

#### Other human factors

Human factors incidents are not limited to errors by pilots. Failure to close a cargo door properly on [Turkish Airlines Flight 981](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Airlines_Flight_981 "Turkish Airlines Flight 981") in 1974 caused the loss of the aircraft – however, design of the cargo door latch was also a major factor in the accident. In the case of [Japan Airlines Flight 123](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Airlines_Flight_123 "Japan Airlines Flight 123") in 1985, improper repair of previous damage led to explosive decompression of the cabin, which in turn destroyed the [vertical stabilizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_stabilizer "Vertical stabilizer") and damaged all four hydraulic systems which powered all the flight controls.

#### Controlled flight into terrain

_Controlled flight into terrain_ (CFIT) is a class of accidents in which an aircraft is flown under control into terrain or man-made structures. CFIT accidents typically result from pilot error or of navigational system error. Failure to protect [ILS critical areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILS_critical_area "ILS critical area") can also cause CFIT accidents\[_[dubious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy_dispute#Disputed_statement "Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute") – [discuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Aviation_safety#Dubious "Talk:Aviation safety")_\]. In December 1995, [American Airlines Flight 965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_965 "American Airlines Flight 965") tracked off course while approaching [Cali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cali "Cali"), [Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia "Colombia") and hit a mountainside despite a [terrain awareness and warning system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrain_awareness_and_warning_system "Terrain awareness and warning system") (TAWS) terrain warning in the cockpit and desperate pilot attempt to gain altitude after the warning. Crew position awareness and monitoring of navigational systems are essential to the prevention of CFIT accidents. As of February 2008[\[update\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aviation_safety&action=edit), over 40,000 aircraft had enhanced TAWS installed, and they had flown over 800 million hours without a CFIT accident.[\[46\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-47)

Another anti-CFIT tool is the Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW) system which monitors the altitudes transmitted by aircraft transponders and compares that with the system's defined minimum safe altitudes for a given area. When the system determines the aircraft is lower, or might soon be lower, than the minimum safe altitude, the [air traffic controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_control "Air traffic control") receives an acoustic and visual warning and then alerts the pilot that the aircraft is too low.[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-48)

#### Electromagnetic interference

The use of certain electronic equipment is partially or entirely prohibited as it might interfere with aircraft operation,[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-ladkin-elec-inter-49) such as causing [compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass "Compass") deviations.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] Use of some types of personal electronic devices is prohibited when an aircraft is below 10,000 feet (3,000 m), taking off, or landing. Use of a [mobile phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone "Mobile phone") is prohibited on most flights because in-flight usage creates problems with ground-based cells.[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-ladkin-elec-inter-49)[\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-live-sci-cells-50)

### Ground damage

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Ground_damage_to_aircraft.jpg/220px-Ground_damage_to_aircraft.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ground_damage_to_aircraft.jpg)

Ground damage to an aircraft. Several

[stringers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stringer_(aircraft) "Stringer (aircraft)")

were cut and the aircraft was grounded

Various [ground support equipment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_support_equipment "Ground support equipment") operate in close proximity to the fuselage and wings to service the aircraft and occasionally cause accidental damage in the form of scratches in the paint or small dents in the skin. However, because aircraft structures (including the outer skin) play such a critical role in the safe operation of a flight, all damage is inspected, measured, and possibly tested to ensure that any damage is within safe tolerances.

An example problem was the depressurization incident on [Alaska Airlines Flight 536](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alaska_Airlines_Flight_536&action=edit&redlink=1 "Alaska Airlines Flight 536 (page does not exist)") in 2005. During ground services a [baggage handler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baggage_handler "Baggage handler") hit the side of the aircraft with a tug towing a train of [baggage carts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baggage_cart "Baggage cart"). This damaged the metal skin of the aircraft. This damage was not reported and the plane departed. Climbing through 26,000 feet (7,900 m) the damaged section of the skin gave way under the difference in pressure between the inside of the aircraft and the outside air. The cabin depressurized explosively necessitating a rapid descent to denser (breathable) air and an emergency landing. Post-landing examination of the fuselage revealed a 12-inch (30 cm) hole on the right side of the airplane.[\[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-51)

### Volcanic ash

Plumes of [volcanic ash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_ash "Volcanic ash") near active [volcanoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano "Volcano") can damage [propellers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller_(aircraft) "Propeller (aircraft)"), [engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_engine "Aircraft engine") and cockpit windows.[\[51\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-52)[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-53) In 1982, [British Airways Flight 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways_Flight_9 "British Airways Flight 9") flew through an ash cloud and temporarily lost power from all four engines. The plane was badly damaged, with all the leading edges being scratched. The front windscreens had been so badly "sand" blasted by the ash that they could not be used to land the aircraft.[\[53\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-54)

Prior to 2010 the general approach taken by airspace regulators was that if the ash concentration rose above zero, then the airspace was considered unsafe and was consequently closed.[\[54\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-55)[Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_Ash_Advisory_Center "Volcanic Ash Advisory Center") enable liaison between [meteorologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology "Meteorology"), [volcanologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanology "Volcanology"), and the aviation industry.[\[55\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-56)

### Runway safety

Types of runway safety incidents include:

### Terrorism

Aircrew are normally trained to handle [hijack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_hijacking "Aircraft hijacking") situations.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] Since the [September 11, 2001 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11,_2001_attacks "September 11, 2001 attacks"), stricter [airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_security "Airport security") and [airline security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_security "Airline security") measures are in place to prevent [terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism "Terrorism"), such as security checkpoints and locking the cockpit doors during flight.

In the United States, the [Federal Flight Deck Officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Flight_Deck_Officer "Federal Flight Deck Officer") program is run by the [Federal Air Marshal Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Air_Marshal_Service "Federal Air Marshal Service"), with the aim of training active and licensed airline pilots to carry weapons and defend their aircraft against criminal activity and terrorism. Upon completion of government training, selected pilots enter a covert law enforcement and counter-terrorism service. Their jurisdiction is normally limited to a flight deck or a cabin of a commercial airliner or a cargo aircraft they operate while on duty.

### Deliberate aircrew action

Although most air crews are screened for psychological fitness, some have taken suicidal actions. In the case of [EgyptAir Flight 990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EgyptAir_Flight_990 "EgyptAir Flight 990"), it appears that the [first officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Officer_(civil_aviation) "First Officer (civil aviation)") deliberately crashed into the Atlantic Ocean while the captain was away from his station in 1999 off Nantucket, Massachusetts.

In 1982, [Japan Airlines Flight 350](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Airlines_Flight_350 "Japan Airlines Flight 350") crashed while on approach to the Tokyo Haneda Airport, killing 24 of the 174 on board. The official investigation found the mentally ill captain had attempted suicide by placing the inboard engines into reverse thrust, while the aircraft was close to the runway. The first officer did not have enough time to countermand before the aircraft stalled and crashed.

In 1997, [SilkAir Flight 185](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SilkAir_Flight_185 "SilkAir Flight 185") suddenly went into a high dive from its cruising altitude. The speed of the dive was so high that the aircraft began to break apart before it finally crashed near [Palembang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palembang "Palembang"), [Sumatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatra "Sumatra"). After three years of investigation, the Indonesian authorities declared that the cause of the accident could not be determined. However, the US NTSB concluded that deliberate suicide by the captain was the only reasonable explanation.

In 2015, on March 24, Germanwings [Flight 9525](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanwings_Flight_9525 "Germanwings Flight 9525") (an Airbus A320-200) crashed 100 kilometres (62 mi) northwest of Nice, in the French Alps, after a constant descent that began one minute after the last routine contact with air traffic control and shortly after the aircraft had reached its assigned cruise altitude. All 144 passengers and six crew members were killed. The crash was intentionally caused by the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz. Having been declared "unfit to work" without telling his employer, Lubitz reported for duty, and during the flight locked the pilot out of the cabin. In response to the incident and the circumstances of Lubitz's involvement, aviation authorities in Canada, New Zealand, Germany and Australia implemented new regulations that require two authorized personnel to be present in the cockpit at all times. Three days after the incident the European Aviation Safety Agency issued a temporary recommendation for airlines to ensure that at least two crew members, including at least one pilot, are in the cockpit at all times of the flight. Several airlines announced they had already adopted similar policies voluntarily.

### Military action

Passenger planes have rarely been attacked in both peacetime and war. Examples:

Accident survivability
----------------------

Earlier tragedies investigations and improved engineering has allowed many safety improvements that have allowed an increasing safer aviation.[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-Shiavo-37)

### Airport design

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Functional_EMAS_Bed_-_NTSB_Docket_Photo.jpg/200px-Functional_EMAS_Bed_-_NTSB_Docket_Photo.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Functional_EMAS_Bed_-_NTSB_Docket_Photo.jpg)

[EMAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineered_materials_arrestor_system "Engineered materials arrestor system")

bed after being run over by landing gear

Airport design and location can have a large impact on aviation safety, especially since some airports such as [Chicago Midway International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Midway_International_Airport "Chicago Midway International Airport") were originally built for propeller planes and many airports are in congested areas where it is difficult to meet newer safety standards. For instance, the FAA issued rules in 1999 calling for a [runway safety area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway_safety_area "Runway safety area"), usually extending 500 feet (150 m) to each side and 1,000 feet (300 m) beyond the end of a runway. This is intended to cover ninety percent of the cases of an aircraft leaving the runway by providing a buffer space free of obstacles.[\[57\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-Abend-58) Many older airports do not meet this standard. One method of substituting for the 1,000 feet (300 m) at the end of a runway for airports in congested areas is to install an [engineered materials arrestor system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineered_materials_arrestor_system "Engineered materials arrestor system") (EMAS). These systems are usually made of a lightweight, crushable concrete that absorbs the energy of the aircraft to bring it to a rapid stop. As of 2008[\[update\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aviation_safety&action=edit), they have stopped three aircraft at [JFK Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport "John F. Kennedy International Airport").

### Emergency airplane evacuations

According to a 2000 report by the [National Transportation Safety Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transportation_Safety_Board "National Transportation Safety Board"), [emergency aircraft evacuations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_aircraft_evacuation "Emergency aircraft evacuation") happen about once every 11 days in the U.S. While some situations are extremely dire, such as when the plane is on fire, in many cases the greatest challenge for passengers can be the use of the [evacuation slide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evacuation_slide "Evacuation slide"). In a _Time_ article on the subject, Amanda Ripley reported that when a new supersized Airbus A380 underwent mandatory evacuation tests in 2006, thirty-three of the 873 evacuating volunteers got hurt. While the evacuation was considered a success, one volunteer suffered a broken leg, while the remaining 32 received slide burns. Such accidents are common. In her article, Ripley provided tips on how to make it down the airplane slide without injury.[\[58\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-59) Another improvement to airplane evacuations is the requirement by the [Federal Aviation Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration "Federal Aviation Administration") for planes to demonstrate an evacuation time of 90 seconds with half the emergency exits blocked for each type of airplane in their fleet. According to studies, 90 seconds is the time needed to evacuate before the plane starts burning, before there can be a very large fire or explosions, or before fumes fill the cabin.[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-Shiavo-37)[\[57\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-Abend-58)

### Aircraft materials and design

Changes such as using new materials for seat fabric and insulation has given between 40 and 60 additional seconds to people on board to evacuate before the cabin gets filled with fire and potential deadly fumes.[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-Shiavo-37) Other improvements through the years include the use of properly rated seatbelts, impact resistant seat frames, and airplane wings and engines designed to shear off to absorb impact forces.[\[57\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-Abend-58)

### Radar and wind shear detection systems

As the result of the accidents due to wind shear and other weather disturbances, most notably the 1985 crash of [Delta Air Lines Flight 191](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines_Flight_191 "Delta Air Lines Flight 191"), the U.S. [Federal Aviation Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration "Federal Aviation Administration") mandated that all commercial aircraft have [on-board wind shear detection systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_wind_shear_detection_and_alert_system "Airborne wind shear detection and alert system") by 1993.[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-National_Aeronautics_and_Space_Administration,_Langley_Research_Center-38) Since 1995, the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by wind shear has dropped to approximately one every ten years, due to the mandated on-board detection as well as the addition of Doppler [weather radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_radar "Weather radar") units on the ground ([NEXRAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEXRAD "NEXRAD")).\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] The installation of high-resolution [Terminal Doppler Weather Radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_Doppler_Weather_Radar "Terminal Doppler Weather Radar") stations at many U.S. airports that are commonly affected by wind shear has further aided the ability of pilots and ground controllers to avoid wind shear conditions.[\[59\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-tdwr-nws-60)

Accidents and incidents
-----------------------

### National investigation organizations

Air safety investigators
------------------------

Air safety investigators are trained and authorized to investigate aviation accidents and incidents: to research, analyse, and report their conclusions. They may be specialized in aircraft structures, air traffic control, flight recorders or human factors. They can be employed by government organizations responsible for aviation safety, manufacturers or unions.

Safety improvement initiatives
------------------------------

The safety improvement initiatives are aviation safety partnerships between regulators, manufacturers, operators, professional unions, research organisations, and international aviation organisations to further enhance safety.[\[60\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-Annex19-61) Some major safety initiatives worldwide are:

*   [**Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST)**](http://www.cast-safety.org/) in the US. The Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) was founded in 1998 with a goal to reduce the commercial aviation fatality rate in the United States by 80 percent by 2007.
*   [**European Strategic Safety Initiative (ESSI)**](http://easa.europa.eu/essi/webapp/essi/www/index.php) . The European Strategic Safety Initiative (ESSI) is an aviation safety partnership between EASA, other regulators and the industry. The initiative objective is to further enhance safety for citizens in Europe and worldwide through safety analysis, implementation of cost effective action plans, and coordination with other safety initiatives worldwide.

After the disappearance of [Malaysia Airlines Flight 370](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370 "Malaysia Airlines Flight 370"), in June 2014, the [International Air Transport Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Air_Transport_Association "International Air Transport Association") said it was working on implementing new measures to track aircraft in flight in real time. A special panel was considering a range of options including the production of equipment especially designed to ensure real-time tracking.[\[61\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-FlightTracking-62)

Since pilot error accounts for between one-third and 60% of aviation accidents, advances in automation and technology could replace some or all of the duties of the [aircraft pilots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_pilot "Aircraft pilot"). Automation since the 1980s has already eliminated the need for [flight engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_engineer "Flight engineer"). In complex situations with severely degraded systems, the problem-solving and judgement capability of humans is challenging to achieve with automated systems, for example the catastrophic engine failures experienced by [United Airlines Flight 232](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_232 "United Airlines Flight 232") and [Qantas Flight 32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qantas_Flight_32 "Qantas Flight 32").[\[62\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-63) However, with more accurate software modeling of aeronautic factors, test planes have been [successfully flown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F-15_STOL/MTD "McDonnell Douglas F-15 STOL/MTD") in these conditions.[\[63\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-64)

While the [accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_accidents_and_incidents "Aviation accidents and incidents") rate is very low, to ensure they do not rise with the [air transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_transport "Air transport") growth, experts recommend creating a robust culture of collecting information from employees without blame.[\[64\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#cite_note-65)
