\[MJKZZ\] sends in this entertaining little tutorial on building a [small automated cannon out of a syringe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21PT2IwS2eY&feature=youtu.be).

He starts the build off by modifying an arc lighter, the fancy kind one might use to light a fire on a windy day, so that it can be controlled by a micro-controller. The arc is moved to the needle end of the syringe with a careful application of wires and hot glue. When the syringe is filled with a bit of alcohol and the original plunger is pressed back in a small spark will send it flying back out in a very satisfying fashion.

Of course it wouldnâ€™t be a proper hack without an Arduino added on for no reason other than the joy of doing so. \[MKJZZ\] adds an ultrasonic sensor into the mix which, when triggered appropriately by an invading object [fires the arc lighter](https://hackaday.com/2019/10/27/making-a-bronze-cannon-from-scratch/) using a reed relay.

He demonstrates the build by eliminating an intruding coke can on his work bench. You can see it in the video after the break. All in all a very fun hack.
