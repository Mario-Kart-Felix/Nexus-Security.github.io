It has been some time since i posted about Slackware updates and around 2.5 years since [my wishlist](https://slackblogs.blogspot.com/2017/07/end-of-july-status-my-wishlist.html) i created in 2017. Only one item left that are still not yet approved by Patrick, but i have a hunch that it's coming soon to -Current tree. So i guess it's time to wrap some updates up to early December 2019:  

*   Linux LTS Kernel 5.4.x
*   PHP 7.4.x
*   GCC 9.2.x
*   GLIBC 2.30
*   Python 3.7.x
*   Perl 5.30.x
*   GTK+3 3.24.x
*   NetworkManager 1.20.x
*   vte 0.58.x
*   XOrg 1.20.x
*   tcl/tk 8.16.x
*   Mesa 19.2.x
*   Bind 9.14.x
*   Rust 1.39.x
*   SDL2.0.x
*   Firefox 68.0-ESR
*   Thunderbird 60.8.x
*   MariaDB 10.4.x
*   Postfix 3.4.x
*   Samba 4.11.x
*   OpenSSH 8.1p1

Basically, most of the list above are bleeding edge packages, so when you read a news telling that Slackware is outdated, please ask them to read the [\-current Changelog](http://www.slackware.com/changelog/current.php?cpu=x86_64). You can see all the added/removed packages since Slackware 14.2 here: [http://slackware.osuosl.org/slackware64-current/CHANGES\_AND\_HINTS.TXT](http://slackware.osuosl.org/slackware64-current/CHANGES_AND_HINTS.TXT)  
  
My (updated) wishlist are:  

*   Add Qt5 and Plasma 5
*   Python 3.8

My two projects: [MATE SlackBuilds](https://github.com/mateslackbuilds/msb/) and [Cinnamon SlackBuilds](https://github.com/CinnamonSlackBuilds/csb) are working nicely with the latest Slackware-Current. Binary packages are hosted in Tadgy's repository: [http://slackware.uk/.](http://slackware.uk/)  
  
Eric's Plasma 5 and LiveSlack projects are also keeping up to date with Slackware development. Please follow the news on his blog: [https://alien.slackbook.org/blog/](https://alien.slackbook.org/blog/)
