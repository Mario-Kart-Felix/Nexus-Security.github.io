> Quick release deflater for Presta valves which are commonly found on bicycle wheels.
> 
> Unscrew the Presta valve locknut and push this piece on, it will hold itself in place while it holds the valve open, allowing the tire to deflate while you do other things. Press the button to open it up and remove it. Despite it having M6x1 threads, it should still grab a smooth valve shaft securely enough to keep those valves open as well.
> 
> Useful to have at least two printed if you have to work on a bike where you are doing maintenance to the tires, such as a tubeless sealant refresh or swapping tires. Once the bike is in the stand and the Presta locknuts are open, pop one of these on each tire valve and this will deflate the tires while you are pulling the wheels out of the frame.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
