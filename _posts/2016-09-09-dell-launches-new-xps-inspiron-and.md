The festival season is right around the corner and Dell has perked up its laptop portfolio with the launch of several new XPS, Inspiron, and Alienware gaming laptops in India. It even upgraded its all-in-one (AIO) desktops at the event in New Delhi, rounding up to a total of 12 new products. Dell has now equipped most of its laptops with the latest 10th-Gen Intel Core processors, so let’s take a look at the new laptops.  

Dell XPS Lineup

Kicking off the show with the new XPS 13 and XPS 15, Dell has packed into its premium laptops an Ultra-HD (4K) OLED screen – where the former houses a 13.3-inch panel and the latter a 15.6-inch panel. The Dell XPS 13 is powered by up to 10th-Gen Intel Core i7-10510U processors, paired with up to 16GB RAM and 512GB PCIe SSD storage. And it is awesome.

Dell XPS 15, on the other hand, is sticking to 9th-Gen Intel Core i9-9980HK processors. This will be coupled with up to 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD storage, and well, Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1650 graphics – which is absent on the former.  

Dell isn’t making both of these Dell XPS laptops available right away. Dell XPS 15 is now available to purchase at Rs. 1,66,990 whereas XPS 13 will go on sale on October 2. The price for the XPS 13 has been set at Rs 1,13,990.
