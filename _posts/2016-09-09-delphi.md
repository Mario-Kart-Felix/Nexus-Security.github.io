[DelPhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DelPhi "DelPhi")

.

**Delphi** is an [event-driven programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming "Event-driven programming") language based on [Object Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Pascal "Object Pascal") and an associated [integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment "Integrated development environment") (IDE) for [rapid application development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development "Rapid application development") of desktop, [mobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_application "Mobile application"), [web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application "Web application"), and [console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Console_application "Console application") software,[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)#cite_note-Buchanan2003-1) currently developed and maintained by [Embarcadero Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarcadero_Technologies "Embarcadero Technologies").

Delphi's compilers generate [native code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_code "Native code") for [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows"), [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS "MacOS"), [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS "IOS"), [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system) "Android (operating system)") and [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux") ([x64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64 "X86-64") only).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)#cite_note-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)#cite_note-auto-3)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)#cite_note-4) Since 2016, there have been new releases of Delphi every six months, with new platforms being added approximately every second release.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)#cite_note-5)

Delphi includes a code editor, a visual designer, an integrated debugger, a [source code control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control "Version control") component, and support for third-party [plugins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plugin_(computing) "Plugin (computing)"). The code editor features [Code Insight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Insight "Code Insight") ([code completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_completion "Code completion")), Error Insight (real-time error-checking), and [refactoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring "Code refactoring"). The visual forms designer has traditionally used [Visual Component Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Component_Library "Visual Component Library") (VCL) for native Windows development, but the [FireMonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FireMonkey "FireMonkey") (FMX) platform was later added for cross-platform development. Database support in Delphi is very strong. A Delphi project of a million lines of code can compile in a few seconds – one benchmark\[_[which?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words "Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words")_\] compiled 170,000 lines per second.

Delphi was originally developed by [Borland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland "Borland") as a [rapid application development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development "Rapid application development") tool for Windows as the successor of [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal "Turbo Pascal"). Delphi added full [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming "Object-oriented programming") to the existing language, and since then the language has grown to support generics and [anonymous methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function "Anonymous function"), and native [Component Object Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model "Component Object Model") (COM) support. In 2006, Borland’s developer tools section was transferred from Borland to a wholly owned subsidiary known as [CodeGear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeGear "CodeGear"), which was sold to [Embarcadero Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarcadero_Technologies "Embarcadero Technologies") in 2008. In 2015, Embarcadero was purchased by [Idera Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idera_Software "Idera Software"), but the Embarcadero mark was retained for the developer tools division.

Delphi and its [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++") counterpart, [C++Builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2BBuilder "C++Builder"), are interoperable. They share many core components, notably the IDE, VCL, and much of the [runtime library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_library "Runtime library"). In addition, they can be used jointly in a project. For example, C++Builder 6 and later can consume Delphi source code and C++ in one project, while packages compiled with C++Builder can be used from within Delphi. In 2007, the products were released jointly as [RAD Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)#RAD_Studio), a shared host for Delphi and C++Builder, which can be purchased with either or both.

Features
--------

Delphi supports [rapid application development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development "Rapid application development") (RAD). Among the features supporting RAD are the [application framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_framework "Application framework") and the visual designer.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] Delphi uses the [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_programming_language "Pascal programming language")\-based programming language called [Object Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Pascal "Object Pascal") introduced by Borland. It supports native [cross-compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-compilation "Cross-compilation"). Its visual designer has traditionally used [Visual Component Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Component_Library "Visual Component Library") (VCL) for RAD.

To better support development for Microsoft Windows and interoperate with code developed with other software development tools, Delphi supports independent interfaces of [Component Object Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model "Component Object Model") (COM) with [reference counted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting "Reference counting") class implementations, and support for many third-party components. [Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computer_science) "Interface (computer science)") implementations can be delegated to fields or properties of classes. Message handlers are implemented by tagging a method of a class with the integer constant of the message to handle.

[Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database "Database") connectivity is extensively supported through the many VCL database-aware and database access components.

Later versions have included upgraded and enhanced runtime library routines provided by the community group [FastCode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastCode "FastCode"), established in 2003.

### Characteristics

Delphi is a [strongly typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly-typed_programming_language "Strongly-typed programming language") [high-level programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language "High-level programming language"), intended to be easy to use and originally based on the earlier Object Pascal language. [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language) "Pascal (programming language)") was originally developed as a general-purpose language "suitable for expressing the fundamental constructs known at the time in a concise and logical way", and "its implementation was to be efficient and competitive with existing FORTRAN compilers"[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)#cite_note-6) but without low-level programming facilities or access to hardware. Turbo Pascal and its descendants, including Delphi, support access to hardware and low-level programming, with the facility to incorporate code written in [assembly language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language "Assembly language") and other languages. Delphi's [object orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming "Object-oriented programming") features only class- and interface-based [polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_in_object-oriented_programming "Polymorphism in object-oriented programming").[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)#cite_note-WangTan2006-7) Metaclasses are first class objects. Objects are actually references to the objects (as in [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language) "Java (programming language)")), which Delphi implicitly de-references, so there is usually no need to manually allocate memory for pointers to objects or use similar techniques that some other languages need. There are dedicated reference-counted string types, and also null-terminated strings.

Strings can be concatenated by using the '+' operator, rather than using functions. For dedicated string types Delphi handles memory management without programmer intervention. Since Borland Developer Studio 2006 there are functions to locate [memory leaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak "Memory leak").

Delphi includes an integrated IDE. The Delphi products all ship with a [Visual Component Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Component_Library "Visual Component Library") (VCL), including most of its source code. Third-party components (sometimes with full [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code "Source code")) and tools to enhance the IDE or for other Delphi related development tasks are available, some free of charge. The IDE includes a GUI for localization and translation of created programs that may be deployed to a translator; there are also third-party tools with more features for this purpose. The VCL framework maintains a high level of source compatibility between versions, which simplifies updating existing source code to a newer Delphi version. Third-party libraries may need updates from the vendor but, if source code is supplied, recompilation with the newer version may be sufficient. The VCL was an early adopter of [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection "Dependency injection") or [inversion of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_Control "Inversion of Control"); it uses a-"re-usable" component model, extensible by the developer. With class helpers new functionality can be introduced to core RTL and VCL classes without changing the original source code of the RTL or VCL.

The compiler is optimizing and single pass. It can optionally compile to a single [executable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable "Executable") which does not require [DLLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library "Dynamic-link library"). Delphi can also generate standard DLLs, [ActiveX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveX "ActiveX") DLLs, [COM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model "Component Object Model") automation servers and Windows services.

The Delphi IDEs since Delphi 2005 increasingly support [refactoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refactoring "Refactoring") features such as method extraction and the possibility to create [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language "Unified Modeling Language") models from the source code or to modify the source through changes made in the model.

Delphi has large communities on [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet "Usenet") and the [web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web"). When Delphi was owned by Codegear, many of its employees actively participated.

### Backward compatibility

Each new release of Delphi attempts to be as compatible as possible with earlier versions, so that already-developed software and libraries can be retained. Incompatibility necessarily arises as new functionality is added.

### Limitations

Although each new release of Delphi attempts to keep as much backwards compatibility as possible to allow existing code reuse, new features, new libraries, and improvements sometimes make newer releases less than 100% backwards compatible. For example, the design of the standard class libraries (VCL/RTL) had become somewhat dated and restrictive; Embarcadero released in 2011 as part of Delphi XE2 a new compiler and cross-platform VCL replacement called FireMonkey, based on Direct3D and OpenGL, which runs on other platforms in addition to Windows, supporting their features, but is not fully backwards-compatible with VCL applications. FireMonkey applications do however allow easy sharing of non visual code [units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_(Software_Development) "Unit (Software Development)") with VCL applications, enabling a lot of code to be ported easily between the platforms.

Some releases of Delphi have been reported to be unstable. Delphi XE7, in particular, was often reported to be slow and subject to severe [memory leaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak "Memory leak").\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

Code examples
-------------

To show a message:

```
procedure TForm1.ShowAMessage; begin ShowMessage('Hello World!'); end; 
```

To give a label a caption using the VCL:

```
procedure TForm1.ShowSomethingOnCreate; begin Label1.Caption := 'Hello World!'; end; 
```

To give a label text using FireMonkey:

```
procedure TForm1.ShowSomethingOnCreate; begin Label1.Text := 'Hello World!'; end; 
```

History
-------

Delphi was originally one of many codenames of a pre-release development tool project at [Borland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland "Borland"). Borland developer [Danny Thorpe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Thorpe "Danny Thorpe") suggested the _Delphi_ codename in reference to the [Oracle at Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_at_Delphi "Oracle at Delphi"). One of the design goals of the product was to provide database connectivity to programmers as a key feature and a popular database package at the time was [Oracle database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_database "Oracle database"); hence, "If you want to talk to \[the\] Oracle, go to Delphi".

As development continued towards the first release, the Delphi codename gained popularity among the development team and beta testing group. However, the Borland marketing leadership preferred a functional product name over an iconic name and made preparations to release the product under the name "Borland AppBuilder".

Shortly before the release of the Borland product, Novell AppBuilder was released, leaving Borland in need of a new product name. After much debate and many market research surveys, the Delphi codename became the Delphi product name.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)#cite_note-8)

The chief architect behind Delphi was [Anders Hejlsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg "Anders Hejlsberg"), who had developed [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal "Turbo Pascal"). He was persuaded to move to [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft") in 1996.

On February 8, 2006 Borland announced that it was looking for a buyer for its IDE and database line of products, including Delphi, to concentrate on its [ALM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_Lifecycle_Management "Application Lifecycle Management") line. On November 14, 2006 Borland transferred the development tools group to an independent subsidiary company named [CodeGear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeGear "CodeGear"), instead of selling it. Borland subsequently sold CodeGear to [Embarcadero Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarcadero_Technologies "Embarcadero Technologies") in 2008. Embarcadero retained the CodeGear division created by Borland to identify its tool and database offerings, but identified its own database tools under the DatabaseGear name. In 2015, Embarcadero was purchased by [Idera Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idera_Software "Idera Software"), but the Embarcadero mark was retained for the developer tools division.

### Early Borland years (1995–2003)

Borland Delphi

Delphi (later known as Delphi 1) was released in 1995 for the 16-bit [Windows 3.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1 "Windows 3.1"), and was an early example of what became known as [Rapid Application Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Application_Development "Rapid Application Development") (RAD) tools. Delphi evolved from Borland's "Turbo Pascal for Windows", itself an evolution with Windows support from Borland's Turbo Pascal and Borland Pascal with Objects, very fast 16-bit native-code MS-DOS compilers with their own sophisticated [integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment "Integrated development environment") (IDE) and [textual user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_user_interface "Text user interface") toolkit for [DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS "DOS") ([Turbo Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Vision "Turbo Vision")). Early Turbo Pascal (for MS-DOS) was written in a dialect of the [Pascal programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language) "Pascal (programming language)"); in later versions support for [objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science) "Object (computer science)") was added, and it was named [Object Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Pascal "Object Pascal"). Delphi has always used Object Pascal, which continued to be developed, as its underlying [object-oriented language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_language "Object-oriented language").

Borland Delphi 2

Delphi 2, released in 1996, supported 32-bit Windows environments. Delphi 1 was bundled with it for creation of 16-bit Windows 3.1 applications. New [Quickreport](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quickreport&action=edit&redlink=1 "Quickreport (page does not exist)") components replacing Borland ReportSmith.

Borland Delphi 3

Delphi 3, released in 1997, added new VCL components encapsulating the 4.71 version of Windows Common Controls (such as Rebar and Toolbar), TDataset architecture separated from BDE, DLL debugging, the code insight technology, component packages, component templates, DecisionCube and [Teechart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teechart "Teechart") components for statistical graphing, [WebBroker](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=WebBroker&action=edit&redlink=1 "WebBroker (page does not exist)"), ActiveForms, [MIDAS three tier architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DataSnap&action=edit&redlink=1 "DataSnap (page does not exist)"), component packages and integration with [COM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model "Component Object Model") through interfaces.

Inprise Delphi 4

Inprise Delphi 4 was released in 1998. IDE came with a completely overhauled editor and became dockable. VCL added support for ActionLists anchors and constraints. Additional improvements were method overloading, dynamic arrays, Windows 98 support, [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(software_platform) "Java (software platform)") interoperability, high performance database drivers, [CORBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORBA "CORBA") development, and Microsoft [BackOffice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BackOffice "BackOffice") support. It was the last version shipped with Delphi 1 for 16 bit programming.

Borland Delphi 5

Borland Delphi 5 was released in 1999. Added concept of frames, parallel development, translation capabilities, enhanced integrated debugger, [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML "XML") support, [ADO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADO.NET "ADO.NET") database support and [reference counting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting "Reference counting") [interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_(object-oriented_programming) "Protocol (object-oriented programming)")

Borland Delphi 6

Attempts to support both Linux and Windows for cross-platform development were made, and a cross-platform alternative to the [VCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Component_Library "Visual Component Library") known as CLX shipped in 2001 with the release of Delphi 6. This was the second product in Borland's series of Linux-compatible native developer tools, establishing code-compatible IDEs for both Linux (see Kylix above) and Windows (Delphi 6) using the shared CLX component framework for both. Later efforts would include CLX in C++Builder 6 and add C++ code-compatibility to the RAD tools line. Delphi 6 included the same CLX version (CLX 1) as the first version of Kylix. CLX 1 had been created before Delphi 6; its feature set was based on VCL 5 and lacked some features added to the VCL 6 shipped with Delphi 6.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)#cite_note-9)

Borland Delphi 7

Delphi 7, released in August 2002, became the standard version used by more Delphi developers than any other single version. It is one of the most successful IDEs created by Borland because of its stability, speed and low hardware requirements, and remains in active use as of 2017. Delphi 7 added support for Windows XP Themes, and added more support for building Web applications. It was the last version of Delphi that did not require mandatory [software activation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_activation "Software activation").

### Later Borland years (2003–2008)

Borland Delphi 8

Delphi 8 (Borland Developer Studio 2.0), released December 2003, was a [.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_.NET "Microsoft .NET")\-only release that compiled Delphi Object Pascal code into .NET [CIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language "Common Intermediate Language"); the IDE was rewritten for this purpose. The IDE changed to a docked interface (called _Galileo_) similar to Microsoft's Visual Studio.NET. Delphi 8 was highly criticized\[_[by whom?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch")_\] for its low quality and its inability to create native applications (Win32 API/x86 code). The inability to generate native applications is only applicable to this release; the capability would be restored in the next release.

Borland Delphi 2005

The next version, Delphi 2005 (Delphi 9, also Borland Developer Studio 3.0), included the Win32 and .NET development in a single IDE, reiterating Borland's commitment to Win32 developers. Delphi 2005 includes design-time manipulation of live data from a database. It also includes an improved IDE and added a _for ... in_ statement (like C#'s [foreach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreach "Foreach")) to the language. However, it was widely criticized[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)#cite_note-10) for its bugs; both Delphi 8 and Delphi 2005 had stability problems when shipped, which were only partially resolved in service packs. The ability to compile native windows applications (\*.exe) was added back into Delphi 2005 after being removed in Delphi 8. CLX support was dropped for new applications from this release onwards.

Borland Delphi 2006

In late 2005 Delphi 2006 (Delphi 10, also Borland Developer Studio 4.0) was released combining development of C# and Delphi.NET, Delphi Win32 and C++ (Preview when it was shipped but stabilized in Update 1) into a single IDE. It was much more stable than Delphi 8 or Delphi 2005 when shipped, and improved further with the release of two updates and several hotfixes.

Turbo Delphi and Turbo Delphi for .NET

On September 6, 2006 The Developer Tools Group (the working name of the not yet spun off company) of Borland Software Corporation released single-language editions of Borland Developer Studio 2006, bringing back the _Turbo_ name. The Turbo product set included Turbo Delphi for Win32, Turbo Delphi for .NET, Turbo C++, and Turbo C#. There were two variants of each edition: _Explorer_, a free downloadable flavor, and a _Professional_ flavor, priced at US$899 for new users and US$399 for upgrades, which opened access to thousands of third-party components. Unlike earlier _Personal_ editions of Delphi, _Explorer_ editions could be used for commercial development.

Codegear Delphi 2007

Delphi 2007 (Delphi 11), the first version by CodeGear, was released on March 16, 2007. The Win32 personality was released first, before the .NET personality of Delphi 2007 based on .NET Framework 2.0 was released as part of the CodeGear RAD Studio 2007 product. New features included support for [MSBuild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSBuild "MSBuild") and enhancements to the VCL for Windows Vista, but the C#Builder feature was dropped in this release as sales were not as high as expected due to Visual Studio also offering C#. The Windows Form designer for Delphi .NET was also dropped in 2007 because it is based on part of the .NET framework API, which Microsoft had changed so drastically in .NET 2.0 that updating the IDE would have been a major undertaking. Delphi 2007 also introduced DBX4 as the next version of dbExpress. For the first time Delphi could be downloaded from the Internet and activated with a license key. Internationalized versions of Delphi 2007 shipped simultaneously in English, French, German and Japanese. RAD Studio 2007 (code named Highlander), which includes .NET and C++Builder development, was released on September 5, 2007.

Delphi for PHP

In CodeGear era emerged an IDE targeting [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP "PHP") development despite the word "Delphi" in its name. That one is Delphi for PHP whose highlight is a VCL-like PHP framework which enables for PHP the same Rapid Application Development methodology as in ASP.NET Web Form. Version 1.0 and 2.0 were released in March 2007 and April 2008 respectively. The IDE would later evolve into [RadPHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RadPHP "RadPHP") after CodeGear's acquisition by Embarcadero.

### Embarcadero years (2008–)

Codegear Delphi 2009

Delphi 2009 (Delphi 12, code named Tiburón), added many new features such as completely reworking the [VCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Component_Library "Visual Component Library") and RTL for full Unicode support, and added generics and [anonymous methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function "Anonymous function") for Win32 native development. Support for .NET development was dropped from the mainstream Delphi IDE starting with this version, and was catered for by the new Delphi Prism 2009 (Version 1.0).[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)#cite_note-11)

Delphi Prism was developed by [RemObjects Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RemObjects_Software "RemObjects Software") and distributed by Embarcadero from 2008 to replace Delphi.NET. It is a combination of RemObjects's mostly Delphi-compatible .NET compiler (without RTL or [VCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Component_Library "Visual Component Library")), a version of the Microsoft Visual Studio Shell without C# or VB support, and some Embarcadero technologies such as dbExpress. Prism is cross-platform capable insofar as it supports the Mono .NET libraries.

Codegear Delphi 2010

Delphi 2010 (code-named Weaver, aka Delphi 14; there was no version 13), was released on August 25, 2009 and is the second Unicode release of Delphi. It includes a new compiler [run-time type information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_type_information "Run-time type information") (RTTI) system, support for Windows 7 [Direct2D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct2D "Direct2D"), touch screen and gestures, a source code formatter, debugger visualizers and the option to also have the old style component palette in the IDE. The new RTTI system makes larger executables than previous versions. Delphi Prism 2010 (Version 3.0) which is the last Visual Studio 2008 only based one was also released in August 2009.

Embarcadero Delphi XE

Delphi XE (aka Delphi 2011,[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)#cite_note-12) code named Fulcrum), was released on August 30, 2010 with Delphi support for Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure were bundled. Delphi Prism XE (Version 4.0) which is the first Visual Studio 2010 based one (However, it can also integrated into Visual Studio 2008) was also released in August 2010. It is essentially a rebranded Delphi Prism 2011 (also Version 4.0) which was released three months earlier. RadPHP had been incorporated in to RAD Studio since RadPHP XE (Version 3.0) that was evolved from the formal Delphi for PHP product developed by CodeGear in its Borland days.

Delphi Starter Edition

On January 27, 2011 Embarcadero announced the availability of a new Starter Edition that gives independent developers, students and micro businesses a slightly reduced feature set[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)#cite_note-13) for a price less than a quarter of that of the next-cheapest version. This Starter edition is based upon Delphi XE with update 1.

Embarcadero Delphi XE2

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/RADStudioXE2WorldTour.jpg/220px-RADStudioXE2WorldTour.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RADStudioXE2WorldTour.jpg)

_RAD Studio XE2 World Tour_

On September 1, 2011 Embarcadero released RAD Studio XE2 (code-named Pulsar,) which included Delphi XE2, [C++Builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2BBuilder "C++Builder"), Embarcadero Prism XE2 (Version 5.0 later upgraded to XE2.5 Version 5.1) which was rebranded from Delphi Prism and RadPHP XE2 (Version 4.0). Delphi XE2 natively supports [64-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X64 "X64") Windows (except the starter edition), in addition to the long-supported 32-bit versions, with some backwards compatibility. Applications for 64-bit platforms can be compiled, but not tested or run, on the 32-bit platform. The XE2 IDE cannot debug 64-bit programs on Windows 8 and above. Delphi XE2 is supplied with both the VCL, and an alternative library called [FireMonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FireMonkey "FireMonkey") that supports Windows, [Mac OS X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X "Mac OS X") and the Apple [iPhone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone "IPhone"), [iPod Touch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch "IPod Touch") and [iPad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad "IPad") portable devices. FireMonkey and VCL are not compatible; one or the other must be used, and older VCL applications cannot use Firemonkey unless user interfaces are recreated with FireMonkey [forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_(programming) "Form (programming)") and [controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUI_widget "GUI widget"). Third parties have published information on how to use Firemonkey forms in VCL software, to facilitate gradual migration, but even then VCL and Firemonkey controls cannot be used on the same form.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)#cite_note-14) Embarcadero says that [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux") [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") support "is being considered for the roadmap", as is [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system) "Android (operating system)"), and that they are "committed to ... FireMonkey. ... expect regular and frequent updates to FireMonkey". Pre-2013 versions only supported iOS platform development with Xcode 4.2.1 and lower, OS X version 10.7 and lower, and iOS SDK 4.3 and earlier.

Embarcadero Delphi XE3

On September 4, 2012 Embarcadero released RAD Studio XE3, which included Delphi XE3, C++Builder, Embarcadero Prism XE3 (Version 5.2) and HTML5 Builder XE3 (Version 5.0) which was upgraded and rebranded from RadPHP. Delphi XE3 natively supports both 32-bit and [64-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X64 "X64") editions of Windows (including Windows 8), and provides support for [Mac OS X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X "Mac OS X") with the Firemonkey 2/FM² framework. [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS "IOS") support was dropped with XE3 release initially (with intent to add support back in with a separate product – Mobile Studio), but applications can continue to be targeted to that platform by developing with Delphi XE2.

Embarcadero Delphi XE4

On April 22, 2013 Embarcadero released RAD Studio XE4, which included Delphi XE4, and C++Builder. There has been no major upgrade for either Embarcadero Prism or HTML5 Builder thence. Delphi XE4 is the first release of the [FireMonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FireMonkey "FireMonkey") mobile platform, featuring cross-platform mobile application development for the [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS "IOS") Simulator and [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS "IOS") Devices. In this version Embarcadero introduces two new compilers for Delphi mobile applications, the Delphi Cross Compiler for the iOS Simulator and the Delphi Cross Compiler for the iOS Devices. These compilers significantly differ from the Win64 desktop compiler as they do not support [COM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model "Component Object Model"), inline assembly of CPU instructions, and six older string types such as PChar. The new mobile compilers advance the notion of eliminating pointers. The new compilers require an explicit style of marshalling data to and from external APIs and libraries. Delphi XE4 Run-Time Library (RTL) is optimized for 0-based, read-only (immutable) Unicode strings, that cannot be indexed for the purpose of changing their individual characters. The RTL also adds status-bit based exception routines for ARM CPUs that do not generate exception interrupts.

Embarcadero Delphi XE5

On September 12, 2013 Embarcadero released RAD Studio XE5, which includes Delphi XE5 and C++Builder. It adds support for Android (specifically: ARM v7 devices running Gingerbread (2.3.3–2.3.7), Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0.3–4.0.4) and Jelly Bean (4.1.x, 4.2.x, 4.3.x)) and iOS 7.

Embarcadero Delphi XE6

On April 15, 2014 Embarcadero released RAD Studio XE6, which included Delphi XE6 and C++Builder. It allows to create natively-compiled apps for all platforms for, desktop, mobile, and wearable devices like Google Glass, with a single C++ or Object Pascal (Delphi) codebase. RAD Studio XE6 adds support for Android 4.4 KitKat. It also became possible to create FireMonkey mobile apps for Android.

Embarcadero Delphi XE7

On September 2, 2014 Embarcadero released RAD Studio XE7, which included Delphi XE7 and C++Builder. It enables Delphi/Object Pascal and C++ developers to extend existing Windows applications and build apps that connect desktop and mobile devices with gadgets, cloud services, and enterprise data and APIs. Also, it enables developers to extend Windows applications using [WiFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WiFi "WiFi") and [Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth "Bluetooth") App Tethering, and create shared user interface code across multiple device form factors, etc.

Embarcadero Delphi XE8

On April 7, 2015 Embarcadero released RAD Studio XE8, which included Delphi XE8 and C++Builder.

Embarcadero Delphi 10 Seattle

On August 31, 2015 Embarcadero released RAD Studio 10 Seattle, which included Delphi and C++Builder.

Embarcadero Delphi 10.1 Berlin

On April 20, 2016 Embarcadero released RAD Studio 10.1 Berlin, which included Delphi and C++Builder, both generating native code for the 32- and 64-bit Windows platforms, OSX, iOS and Android (ARM, MIPS and X86 processors). Delphi 10.1 Berlin Update 2 introduced the ability to create Windows 10 Store applications from the Delphi IDE using Desktop Bridge.

Embarcadero Delphi 10.2 Tokyo

On March 22, 2017 Embarcadero released RAD Studio 10.2 Tokyo, adding 64-bit Linux support, limited to console and non-visual applications. In addition this release features RTL and IDE improvements, multi-tenancy support in RAD server and improved database capabilities.

Embarcadero Delphi 10.2 Tokyo (Community Edition)

On July 18, 2018 Embarcadero released Community Edition for free download. You are not allowed to earn more than $5,000. Library source code and VCL/FMX components are more limited compared to Professional.

Embarcadero Delphi 10.3 Rio

On November 21, 2018 Embarcadero released RAD Studio 10.3 Rio. This release had a lot of improvements, new components for High DPI / 4K screens on the VCL and an entirely new look for the IDE. Two new features were added to the language: inline block-local variable declarations and [type inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference "Type inference"). Versions 10.3.1, 10.3.2, and 10.3.3 (November 21, 2019) were also released.

Roadmaps
--------

Embarcadero publishes "roadmaps" describing their future development plans. The most recent one was published in May 2019.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)#cite_note-15), which was amended in August 2019 [\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)#cite_note-16)

*   Borland Enterprise Studio, a precursor to RAD Studio, is a software development suite that includes support for multiple languages. Borland Enterprise Studio for Windows supports Delphi.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)#cite_note-17)
*   [Borland Kylix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Kylix "Borland Kylix"): Similar to Borland Enterprise Studio, but only supports C++ and Delphi, but for Linux. To get a product out quickly and cheaply, they made the IDE depend on the [Wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_(software) "Wine (software)") libraries rather than Linux's native system libraries (glibc). The expense of developing a native glibc version of Kylix, combined with the lack of Linux adoption among programmers at the time, made sales go soft, and Kylix was abandoned after version 3. This was the first attempt to add Linux support in the Delphi product family.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] Kylix used the new CLX cross-platform framework, instead of Delphi's VCL.
*   [RAD Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAD_Studio "RAD Studio"): a development of tool suite by Borland Software Corporation (later Embarcadero), consists of Delphi, [C++Builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2BBuilder "C++Builder"), Embarcadero Prism, and HTML5 Builder. Like Delphi, there are different editions of RAD Studio: Professional edition, Enterprise edition, Ultimate edition and Architect edition.
*   [InterBase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterBase "InterBase") integrates natively to Delphi and C++Builder for client/server or embedded development and can be accessed by all major languages and platforms in the market with database connection protocols like ODBC, ADO, ADO.NET and even with Java by JDBC/ODBC Bridge or Java type 4 connectors.
*   [JBuilder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBuilder "JBuilder") is a tool for Java development based on Eclipse since version JBuilder 2007.
*   [RadPHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RadPHP "RadPHP") (now superseded by HTML5 Builder) was an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment "Integrated development environment") for [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP "PHP") that provides true RAD functionality. It has a form designer similar to that of Delphi or [Visual Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic "Visual Basic"), and an integrated debugger based on the [Apache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server "Apache HTTP Server") web server. It also includes a [VCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Component_Library "Visual Component Library") library ported to PHP. Unlike other IDEs it supports Web 2.0 features such as [AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX "AJAX"). Delphi for PHP was announced on March 20, 2007, renamed on October 2010 to RadPHP, and is based on Qadram Q studio. Embarcadero acquired Qadram in January 2011.
*   Delphi Prism (later known as Embarcadero Prism) derived from the [Oxygene programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygene_(programming_language) "Oxygene (programming language)") (previously known as Chrome) from RemObjects. It ran in the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE rather than RAD Studio. It was licensed and re-branded by Embarcadero to replace Delphi.NET when that product was discontinued. Although RemObjects Oxygene was further developed and incorporated support for native Java, Android, iOS and OS X development, the version licensed by Embarcadero was limited to only supporting .NET. It was eventually discontinued by Embarcadero with the release of Delphi XE4, leaving the Delphi product line with no support for .NET development. The Oxygene product it was based on continues to be developed by RemObjects as part of their Elements product line.
*   [Free Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Pascal "Free Pascal") is an open-source Pascal [cross-platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform "Cross-platform") [cross-compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-compiler "Cross-compiler") that supports most of Delphi's Object Pascal code. Free Pascal also has its own language extensions, multiple compiler \[language syntax\] modes, and supports 18+ operating systems and 9+ processor architectures.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)#cite_note-18)[Lazarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_(IDE) "Lazarus (IDE)") is a cross-platform RAD IDE that uses the Free Pascal compiler. Lazarus and Free Pascal – free software independent of Embarcadero – are largely compatible with code written for Delphi.
