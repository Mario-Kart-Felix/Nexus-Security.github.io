==============================================================

The Demikernel is a library operating system architecture designed for use with kernel-bypass I/O devices. The Demikernel architecture offers a uniform system call API across kernel-bypass technologies (e.g., RDMA, DPDK) and OS functionality (e.g., a user-level networking stack for DPDK). Demeter OS is our first Demikernel OS, currently in the prototype stage.

To read more about the motivation behind the Demikernel, check out this [blog post](http://irenezhang.net/blog/2019/05/21/demikernel.html).

To get details about the system, read our [HotOS paper](http://irenezhang.net//papers/demikernel-hotos19.pdf).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Application wanting to use the Demikernel/Demeter OS should include header files from `include/dmtr`. Most of the Demeter libOS code is contained in `src/c++/libos`. Example applications that work with the Demikernel API are in `src/c++/apps/` and `submodules/redis-*/`.

*   `include/dmtr/` - Demikernel/Demeter header files
*   `scripts/` - scripts for using the Demikernel/Demeter OS
    *   `build/` - build scripts
    *   `cmake/` - cmake build scripts
    *   `run/` - scripts for running experiments
    *   `setup/` - scripts for setting up environment to use the Demikernel
*   `src/c++/` - most of the Demikernel/Demeter libOS code
    *   `apps/` - C++ Demikernel example apps
        *   `echo/` - A simple multi-client echo server
    *   `latency/` - performance measurement code for measuring latencies of various components
    *   `libos/` - All Demikernel/Demeter libOS components
        *   `common/` - code common to all libOSes regardless of kernel-bypass device. Implements functionality across queues.
        *   `lwip/` - simple DPDK libOS based on the [lwIP stack](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/).
        *   `posix/` - libOS without kernel-bypass using the POSIX API and the Linux kernel for I/O
        *   `rdma/` - RDMA libOS using two-sided operations to implements Demikernel queues
        *   `rdmacm-common/`
        *   `spdk` - simple libOS that implements a single log file on a SPDK drive. (untested)
*   `submodules` - Demikernel/Demeter external dependencies and example applications
    *   `Heap-Layers/` - needed by Hoard
    *   `Hoard/` - unmodified Hoard memory allocator
    *   `HoardRdma` - modified version of Hoard that registers all of the heap for RDMA access
    *   `dpdk/` - version of DPDK used for Demikernel/Demeter
    *   `redis-lwip` - modified Redis to work with the Demikernel interfaces, set up to compile with lwIP libOS
    *   `redis-posix` - modified Redis to work with the Demikernel interfaces, set up to compile with POSIX libOS
    *   `redis-rdma` - modified Redis to work with the Demikernel interfaces, set up to compile with RDMA libOS
    *   `redis-vanilla` - unmodified version of Redis
    *   `spdk` - version of SPDK used for spdk libOS
    *   `tapir-lwip` - version of TAPIR modified to run with Demikernel syscall API, set up to compile with lwIP libOS
    *   `tapir-posix` - version of TAPIR modified to run with Demikernel syscall API, set up to compile with POSIX libOS
    *   `tapir-rdma` - version of TAPIR modified to run with Demikernel syscall API, set up to compile with RDMA libOS
