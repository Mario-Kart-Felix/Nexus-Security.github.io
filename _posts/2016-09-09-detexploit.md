**DetExploit - Software That Detect Vulnerable Applications, Not-Installed OS Updates And **

**Notify To User**

DetExploit is software that detect [vulnerable](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Vulnerable "vulnerable") applications and not-installed important OS updates on the system, and notify them to user.  
As we know, most of cyberattacks uses vulnerability that is released out year before.  
I thought this is huge problem, and this kind of technology should be more powerful than technology that will detect unknown malwares or exploits.  
Also this project is my theme of [Mitou Jr](https://jr.mitou.org/ "Mitou Jr") project in Japan.  
I wish and work hard to make this an huge OSS (Open Source Software) project, to help these days society.
