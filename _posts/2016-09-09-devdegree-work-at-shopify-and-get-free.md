### 4 year accelerated program

Dev Degree
----------

Dev Degree is a 4-year, work-integrated learning program that combines hands-on developer experience at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.ca/) with an accredited Computer Science degree from either [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/ "https://carleton.ca/") or [York University](https://lassonde.yorku.ca/ "https://lassonde.yorku.ca/").

Working closely with our university partners, students take three university courses on campus each term and spend ~25 hours each week at Shopify.

Throughout the program, students apply theory to real-world problems, learn development skills and new technologies, and receive mentorship from industry leaders while maximizing their personal growth.

What's it like to be a developer at Shopify?
--------------------------------------------

What our students are saying
----------------------------

> The things I learn at Shopify help me progress at school, and the things I learn in class provide context for my work.

> I have been fortunate enough to work with brilliant developers who have not only taught me key software engineering skills, but have also worked with me to set and achieve specific goals related to my personal growth and development.

> I didn’t even know what type of questions to ask. But even getting things wrong, I learned so much — and I really enjoyed the process.
