==============================================================

**Dezoomify** allows you to download zoomable images. Enter the URL of such an image in the text field below. The image will be downloaded at maximal resolution. You can then right-click on the image, and choose "Save As" in order to save it as a PNG file on your computer. If it doesn't work, read our [FAQ](https://github.com/lovasoa/dezoomify/wiki/Dezoomify-FAQ). If you want more information, read our [project page](https://github.com/lovasoa/dezoomify#dezoomify).
