> Add some flair to your board game nights and tabletop campaigns! Based on a wacky antique store find, this dice tumbler will roll up to three standard d20’s or up to four other polyhedral dice.
> 
> Prints with minimal support and assembles within minutes using only super glue (no tools required). The bottom plate is reversible, so it can be adapted to comfortably use regardless of whether you’re left- or right-handed.
> 
> I’m hoping to keep iterating on this in the near future, so feedback is appreciated! Please consider tossing me a tip if you like the design, it helps me keep making and sharing things.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
