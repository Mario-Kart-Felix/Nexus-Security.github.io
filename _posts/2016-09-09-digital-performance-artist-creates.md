Berlin-based performance and installation artist, [Simon Weckert](http://www.simonweckert.com/), likes to do pieces that bring attention to the deeper impacts that digital technologies are having on our lives. In “Google Map Hacks,” he shows how easy it is to confound digital mapping data by hauling 99 functioning cellphones around in a wagon to trick mapping software into thinking that there’s a traffic jam on the street.
