\[Phillip\]’s project is not just great for learning new words, it also [shows just how complex natural systems can be. ](https://hackaday.io/project/165953-diurnal-reef-controller-for-lighting-and-tides)

As we know from news around the word, reefs are delicate systems prone to damage from just about any imaginable threat. Escaped aquarium fish, sunscreen, and the wayward feet of well meaning tourists to name a few. So it’s no wonder that aquarium hobbyists sometimes go to incredible lengths to [simulate](https://hackaday.com/2007/06/01/wireless-reef-automation/) the natural environments these creatures live in.

While \[Phillip\] is still tinkering with his designs for this project, we found the data he included really interesting. His goal is to be able to plug in any coordinate on the earth and have the lights replicate the location. That includes not just the sun, but also the light from the moon as many corals seem to only spawn during certain tides. Of course no LED is perfect so he’s even experimenting with putting light sensors under the water to provide a feedback loop to make it perfect.

We really like the ambition of this project and we hope he continues.
