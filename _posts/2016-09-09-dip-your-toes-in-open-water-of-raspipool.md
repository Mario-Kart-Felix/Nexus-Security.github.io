If you’re lucky enough to have a swimming pool, well, you may not feel all that lucky. Pools are great to have on a hot summer day, but keeping them crystal clear and pH-balanced is a deep dive into tedium. Sure, there are existing systems out there. They cost a kiddie pool of cash and are usually limited to particular pool parts. Existing DIY solutions are almost as bad, and so \[segalion\] is making waves with [a dumb, brand-agnostic pool automation system called Raspipool](https://github.com/segalion/raspipool).

Sensors for pH, ORP, and temperature are immersed in pool water flowing through a bypass pipe that runs between the filter and the pump. The basic plan is to control the pumps and sensors with a web-enabled Raspberry Pi, and have the Pi send action and threshold notifications straight to \[segalion\]’s poolside lounge chair. Each piece is dedicated to a single task, which allows for easy customization and future expansion.

\[segalion\] is trying to get more people involved so that Raspipool can keep really make a splash. Be sure to check out [the project wiki](https://github.com/segalion/raspipool/wiki) and let him know if you can help or have suggestions.

We’re glad \[segalion\] is building from the ground up, and doesn’t have to [dive into some pre-existing mess of an automation system](https://hackaday.com/2016/09/05/enjoy-the-last-throes-of-summer-with-a-nice-pool-automation-project/).
