Did you know that your current headphones could sound even better than you think? At CES 2020, Swedish audio company Dirac unveiled its new digital audio offering for smartphones and other mobile devices.

It allows you to instantly toggle on better audio for your existing headphones. Dirac’s engineers have broken down the audio profiles for dozens of models of headphones and tweaked the audio balance for each of their individual performance.

 During the demo, we tested the function using an app and Beats Solo 3 headphones. A simple tap on the Dirac app allowed us to toggle the audio enhancement on or off. The difference between the standard and enhanced audio was quite stark. The Dirac-boosted music had a much fuller sound, and had an element of 360-degree audio as opposed to the flat standard music.

While you might not know Dirac by name, the company is no stranger to producing excellent audio. The company’s technology already powers audio in many home, automotive, and mobile devices. CES 2020 marks the first time that the company has had a booth on the show floor, which fits well with this new consumer-focused tool.

Dirac’s sound boosting solution is complete; the company is currently looking into distribution channels for it. In the near future, you will likely see Dirac’s audio boosting as an option on your smartphone or as part of your favorite audio streaming service.

The biggest takeaway from this release is that anyone can use it to make their headphones sound much better with very little effort. You may already have an equalizer on your phone, but those are difficult to use for people who don’t fully understand sound. Using Dirac’s app is like handing your headphones to a professional audio mixer, who then tweaks them to become the best they can be.

Keep an eye out for this sometime soon, and you’ll never be able to go back to the old way of listening to music again.
