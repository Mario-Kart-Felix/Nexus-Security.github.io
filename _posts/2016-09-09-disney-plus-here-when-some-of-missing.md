[Disney+](https://www.cnet.com/news/disney-plus-streaming-service-everything-to-know-prices-shows-movies-marvel-star-wars-pixar/) is finally with us, and Marvel is a big part of the service. There are a number of live-action Marvel shows in the works, but while we wait for those, various movies from the Marvel Cinematic Universe are available to watch right now . Disney+ launched with 16 MCU titles, and although there were notable omissions, we know when some of the missing films will be released.

Of the seven missing MCU films, four will hit the service over the next eight months. Thor: Ragnarok will arrive first, on December 5, 2019, with Black Panther joining the collection on March 4, 2020. Avengers: Infinity War and Ant-Man and the Wasp will follow on June 25 and July 29 respectively. The movies are currently listed on Disney+, and the delay is explained as "existing agreements." The hold-up is that they are still licensed to Netflix, and can't move over to Disney+ until that deal finishes.

The other three missing MCU films are The Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man: Homecoming, and Spider-Man: Far From Home. The rights to these movies are complicated by the fact that other studios are involved--the Spider-Man films are co-productions with Sony, while Universal is the distributor of The Incredible Hulk. Disney has [confirmed](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-movies-wont-be-on-disney-plus/1100-6471403/) that neither Spidey movie will be coming to Disney+ due to its arrangement with Sony.

As for the Marvel TV shows in development, these include [Loki](https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/loki-everything-we-know-about-the-upcoming-disney-/2900-2974/), [WandaVision](https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wandavision-everything-we-know-about-the-weirdest-/2900-2959/), [Hawkeye](https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/hawkeye-everything-we-know-about-the-avenging-arch/2900-2996/), [The Falcon and the Winter Soldier](https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-everything-we-kn/2900-2964/), and [She-Hulk](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-announces-marvel-she-hulk-series-for-disney/1100-6469346/).
