You need a free premium Disney Plus account to watch your favorite shows? We got you covered! Disney+ is the official name for the Disney streaming service. It is the home for people of all ages to watch movies and TV shows across all of Disney’s brands. That includes its main Disney brand, its Pixar animated movies, its Marvel Studios and Star Wars properties, and National Geographic. The service will also have content from its recent acquisition of 20th Century Fox.  
**How much does Disney Plus cost?**  
Disney+ costs $ 6.99 a month or $ 69.99 a year ($ 5.83 / month). This low price includes hours of entertainment that cover many genres and interests, and above all is that everything is ad-free.
