Disney+ surpassed 10 million subscribers in its first day, the company announced today.

Disney's announcement comes after Apptopia announced that the Disney+ has been downloaded more than 3.2 million times. That's despite tech problems that affected the country throughout the day.

Disney also confirmed that "there are no plans to release Disney+ subscriber data outside of The Walt Disney Company's quarterly earnings calls." The next time we'll hear about subscriber numbers will be in 2020.
