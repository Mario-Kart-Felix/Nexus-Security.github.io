[The CLUE board](https://www.adafruit.com/clue) has a 9 DoF motion sensor (accel/gyro/mag) that can be used to calculate orientation ([video](https://youtu.be/Z0IpAMcecHE)). Itâ€™s hard to visualize using just text. Normally folks would use a Processing sketch to display the 3D model but now that webserial is available in the browser, itâ€™s much easier to use that! This website uses webserial to get the Euler angles & three.js to display a bunny that moves around. Weâ€™ll update it to use quaternions next ![ðŸ™‚](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png)
