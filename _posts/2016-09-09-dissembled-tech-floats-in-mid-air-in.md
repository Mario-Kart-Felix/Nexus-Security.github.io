> Auckland, New Zealand-based photographer [Richard Parry](https://www.instagram.com/_richardparry_/?hl=en) channels this fear in his beautifully shocking _Some Assembly Required_ photo series. Parry tears apart the most iconic tech from the past few decades and displays it in an awe-inspiring matrix of nuts and bolts, each piece marking the evolution of consumer tech from the inside out.

> “First, I’ve got to strip them all down to their parts and clean all the years of dirt and dust out. (There’s heaps.) I lay everything out in order of what level they’ll be on.
