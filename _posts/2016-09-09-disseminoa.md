Welcome to Dissemin
-------------------

Dissemin detects papers behind paywalls and helps their authors to upload them in one click to an open repository.

Green Open Access
-----------------

Many researchers do not use their right to make their papers freely available online, in addition to the paywalled version of traditional publishers.

Uploading your papers to open repositories has significant advantages:

1.  Your research is available to everyone, increasing your readership and impact.
2.  You help universities abandon overpriced journal subscriptions.

Open Repositories
-----------------

Uploading your papers on your own webpage is not enough. Your papers are easier to find and more secure in the long-term when uploaded to arXiv, Zenodo or institutional repositories.

Latest Uploads
--------------

Researchers use Dissemin to make sure all their publications can be accessed freely. Have a look at their latest uploads:
