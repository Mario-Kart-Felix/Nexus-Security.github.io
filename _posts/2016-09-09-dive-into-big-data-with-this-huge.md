Over the next decade, biotechnology and computer science are likely to shape our world. Artificial brains will take decisions and smart cities will run themselves. But to make that happen, someone needs to build programs and algorithms for analyzing vast amounts of data. If you want to dive into this lucrative niche, the [Essential MATLAB & LabVIEW Mega Bundle](https://deals.makeuseof.com/sales/the-essential-matlab-and-labview-mega-bundle?utm_source=makeuseof.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-essential-matlab-and-labview-mega-bundle&utm_term=scsf-338555&utm_content=a0x1P000004Mc99&scsonar=1) is a great place to start. The bundle contains nine courses, covering some of the key development tools used by programmers, engineers and scientists. Right now, you can [get the training for $29](https://deals.makeuseof.com/sales/the-essential-matlab-and-labview-mega-bundle?utm_source=makeuseof.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-essential-matlab-and-labview-mega-bundle&utm_term=scsf-338555&utm_content=a0x1P000004Mc99&scsonar=1) at MakeUseOf Deals.

**MATLAB, LabVIEW, and More**
-----------------------------

There are many frameworks for building algorithms and simulations. But in the scientific community, MATLAB and LabVIEW are usually favored. To break into biotech or design the future, it’s a good idea to know the tools.

This bundle gives you a comprehensive education. Through 342 video tutorials, you learn how to build advanced algorithms, data simulations and visualizations, and GUIs. You don’t need any previous experience with code, and each of the nine courses provides plenty of hands-on practice.

Along the way, you will learn to build data models with Simulink, connected systems with labVIEW, and polished user-facing apps with MATLAB.

**62 Hours for $29**
