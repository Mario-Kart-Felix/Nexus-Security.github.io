> This project was done as part of our project week at University of Applied Sciences Osnabrueck. It was inspired by already available Instructables like:
> 
> Arcade Spielekonsole Mit Raspberry Pi  
> Barcade Arcade for all
> 
> Except having an arcade machine after finishing this project, you will also have a machine, that is able to stream Youtube videos, show pictures or play music from a NAS or harddrive/USB.
> 
> Sixteen People worked in a team together to finalize the arcade machine within a time range of five days. Due to the amount of members in the group it was possible to allocate the different steps of building the machine in order to work more efficiently.
