One thing that always means the end of the year is close is the reappearance of TV ads for “The Clapper.” After all, who needs home automation when you can clap on and clap off? While we’re partial to our usual home automation solutions, \[Utsource123\] shows us that building a clapper can be a fun and easy project using several similar circuits. One with a [few transistors](https://www.instructables.com/id/Clapping-Switch-With-BC547-Transistor/) and [another one with a 555](https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-Clapping-Switch-Circuit/) because, after all, what can’t a 555 do?

Of course, these circuits usually have a microphone. We were trying to think of how you could make a sound-sensitive element out of common parts. After all, you don’t care about the fidelity of the microphone pickup, just that it hears a loud noise. The circuits are about what you’d expect. The transistor version uses one to amplify the microphone and another to switch on the LED. You’d need a bit more to trigger a relay. The 555 uses an even simpler preamp transistor as a trigger.

While we aren’t bowled over with the idea of a clapper, we imagine these circuits aren’t far removed from the ones you buy in stores. For about $16 you also get enough switching to handle a simple AC load, though. Maybe Alexa and Google should allow making clapping a wake up word?

This is sure simpler than the last [clapper clone](https://hackaday.com/2019/01/18/diy-clapper-is-1980s-style-with-raspberry-pi-twist/) we saw. Then there’s the [deluxe DIY version](https://hackaday.com/2018/07/13/give-the-clapper-a-hand/).
