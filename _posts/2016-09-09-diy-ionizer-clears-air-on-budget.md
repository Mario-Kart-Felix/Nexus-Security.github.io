Have you ever had a good, deep breath of the air near a waterfall, or perhaps after a thunderstorm? That unmistakably fresh smell is due to ionized air, specifically negative ions, and many are the claims concerning their health benefits. A minor industry has sprung up to capitalize on the interest in ionized air, and while \[Amaldev\] wanted to clean up the Mumbai air coming into his home, he didn’t want to pay a lot for a commercial unit. [So he built his own air ionizer for only about $10](http://amaldev.blog/build-ioniser-in-under-10-dollars/).

When \[Amaldev\] dropped this in the Hackaday tip line, he indicated that he’d been taking some heat for the design from Instagram followers. We imagine a fair number of the complaints stem from the cluster of sewing needles that bristle from one end of the PCB and are raised to 6,000 volts by a fifteen-stage [Cockcroft-Walton multiplier](https://hackaday.com/2012/02/10/cockroft-walton-multiplier-can-output-positive-or-negative-voltage/). That’s sure to raise eyebrows, or possible the hair on one’s head if you happen to brush by the emitters. Or perhaps \[Amaldev\]’s critics are dubious about the benefits of ionized air; indeed, some commenters on the video below seem to think that the smoke in the closed jar was not precipitated by the ion stream as \[Amaldev\] claims, but rather somehow was settled by heat or some other trickery.

Neither of those bothers us as much as the direct 230-volt mains connection, though. We’d have preferred to see at least an isolation transformer in there, or perhaps [a battery-powered flyback circuit](https://hackaday.com/2011/08/21/controlling-a-flyback-transformer-with-an-arduino/) to supply the input to that multiplier. Still, the lesson on cascade multipliers was welcome, and we found the smoke-clearing power of ionized air pretty amazing.
