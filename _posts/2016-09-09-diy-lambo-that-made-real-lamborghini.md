When you start sharing your projects with the world, you never know who might take notice. \[Sterling Backus\] and his son \[Xander\] have been [building a functional Lamborghini Aventador look alike](https://www.youtube.com/user/lasersterling/videos) in their garage, and the real Lamborghini company caught wind of it and decided to turn it into an [awesome Christmas ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c58s1mYmkKw).

Named the AXAS Interceptor by its creators, the car is built from scratch around a custom tubular space frame chassis. Most of the body panels are 3D printed and then skinned with carbon fibre, with a few sheet metal panels mixed in. The interior is mix of parts from other cars and aftermarket components, with 3D printing to pull everything together. The drivetrain consists of an engine from a Corvette, a transaxle from a Porsche 996, with the rest of the chassis components being either aftermarket or custom-fabricated pieces.

\[Sterling\] got an unexpectedcall from Lamborghini, and they arranged to secretly sneak a real Aventador into the garage in the dead of night to surprise the rest of the family, and let them borrow it for a few weeks. Lamborghini got some marketing out of it, which most people would probably agree is a pretty good deal. We would admit that we’re quite envious.

The car is driveable, but still many hours from being complete. \[Sterling\] admits that he is no car building professional, but we’re impressed by what he has been able to achieve so far with this ambitious project, and we’re looking forward to the finished product.

If you want to get your feet wet with your first project car, here’s [how you pick one](https://hackaday.com/2019/12/02/how-to-get-into-cars-choosing-your-first-project-car/).
