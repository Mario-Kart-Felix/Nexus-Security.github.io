> A few years ago one of our neighbors had a few jack-oâ€™-lanterns in spirit of halloween. Like everyone he used candles to light them up and give them that original halloween glow! One pumpkin actually caused a few dry leaves to catch fire. Thankfully it wasnâ€™t anything major and no one was hurt and because of that it led me to go searching in some alternative methods. I found an easy way to give jack-oâ€™-lanterns a great glow without the risk of a fire. Now it is rare that one will cause a fire but it does run a small risk. Also using this small and easy method you can keep your pumpkin lit up all night and never have to worry! Peace of mind is always a good thing :). If you want to learn how to make your jack-oâ€™-lanterns glow with original halloween fear and ease and peace of mind then let me borrow a few minutes of your time and show you how simple it is ![ðŸ™‚](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png)
