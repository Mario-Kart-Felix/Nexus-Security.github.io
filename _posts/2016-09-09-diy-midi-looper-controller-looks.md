title: 'DIY MIDI Looper Controller Looks Fantastic!'

Due to pedalboard size, complicated guitar pedals sometimes reduce the number of buttons to the bare minimum. Many of these pedals are capable of being controlled with an external MIDI controller, however, and necessity being the mother of invention and all, this is a great opportunity to build something and learn some new skills at the same time. In need of a MIDI controller, Reddit user \[Earthwin\] built an Arduino powered one to control his Boss DD500 Looper pedal and the [result is great looking](https://imgur.com/a/Bckw6cf).

Five 16×2 LCD screens, one for each button, show the functionality that that button currently has. They are attached (through some neat wiring) to a custom-built PCB which holds the Arduino that controls everything. The screens are mounted to an acrylic backplate which holds the screens in place while the laser-cut acrylic covers are mounted to the same plate through the chassis. The chassis is a standard Hammond aluminum box that was sanded down, primed and then filler was used to make the corners nice and smooth. Flat-top LEDs and custom 3D printed washers finish off the project.

\[Earthwin\] admits that this build might be overkill for the looper that he’s using, but he had fun building the controller and learning to use an Arduino. He’s already well on his way to building another, using the lessons learned in this build. If you want to build your own MIDI controller, [this](https://hackaday.com/2019/04/06/make-your-own-midi-controller-with-an-arduino/) article should help you out. And then you’re ready to [build your controller into a guitar](https://hackaday.com/2011/09/29/fully-fretted-guitar-midi-controller/) if you want to.
