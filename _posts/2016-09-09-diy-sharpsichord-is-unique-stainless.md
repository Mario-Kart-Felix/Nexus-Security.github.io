> It’s an automatic acoustic harp created by instrument creator Henry Dagg on a grant from the English Folk Dance and Song Society. It was originally designed as an interactive sound-sculpture for the gardens of [Cecil Sharp House](https://www.cecilsharphouse.org/). It eventually went beyond that vision as it ultimately ended up in Bjork’s _Biophilia_ showcase (see the video below).
> 
> The Sharpsichord is totally made of stainless steel and designed to allow a musician to compose his or her own music by screwing a ‘pin’ into the surface of a perforated cylinder at the position required for each note to be played. Each of the 11,520 holes is threaded to accept a 3mm threaded pin kept in a tray under the cylinder.
