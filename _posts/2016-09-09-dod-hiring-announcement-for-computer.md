You will be evaluated for this job based on how well you meet the qualifications above.

Traditional rating and ranking of applications does not apply to this vacancy. Your application (resumes and supporting documentation) will be evaluated to determine if you meet the minimum qualifications required as listed in this announcement.  
  
Veterans' Preference eligibility under 5 U.S.C. 2108 and 2108a applies and is treated as a positive factor when making a selection from external sources. When making final selections, any candidate with Veterans' Preference should be granted preference in selection over non-preference eligible candidates with substantially equal qualifications as described in the Best Meets Mission Requirements definition below. If you are a veteran claiming Veterans' Preference, as defined by section 2108 of Title 5 U.S.C., you must submit documents verifying your eligibility with your application package.  
  
**Best Meets Mission Requirements definition**: Applicant has the knowledge, skills, abilities, and/or competencies to substantially exceed the minimum qualification requirements for the position. This equates to the best qualified assessment criteria established for the vacancy and based on overall demonstrated experience, education, training, appraisals/evaluations, job-related awards, certifications, honors and relevant outside activities.  
  
When the application process is complete, we will review your resume to ensure you meet the hiring eligibility and qualification requirements listed in this announcement. You will be rated based on the information provided in your resume and responses to the _Occupational Questionnaire_, along with your supporting documentation to determine your ability to demonstrate the following competencies:  
  

*   Analytical Methods, Models, and Simulation
*   Critical Thinking
*   Data Analysis
*   Flexibility
*   Interpretation of Analysis to Support Decisions
*   Operations Research Investigation and Testing
*   Oral Communication
*   Problem Solving

Your application package (resume, supporting documents, and responses to the questionnaire) will be used to determine your eligibility and qualifications for this position. Please follow all instructions carefully. Errors or omissions may affect your rating or consideration for employment.

Your responses to the questionnaire may be compared to the documents you submit. The documents you submit must support your responses to the online questionnaire. If your application contradicts or does not support your questionnaire responses, you will receive a rating of "not qualified" or "insufficient information" and you will not receive further consideration for this job.

Applicants who disqualify themselves will not be evaluated further.
