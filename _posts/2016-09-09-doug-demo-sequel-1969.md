Doug's Demo Sequel: 1969  
[0](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/378/#0)
====================================================================================

Not long after Doug Engelbart's ground-breaking [Mother of All Demos](http://theDemo.org) in December 1968, he and his team demonstrated their research at another conference in San Francisco – the 32nd Annual Meeting of the American Society for Information Science (ASIS), in October 1969. This live demo presentation, titled "Augmentation Systems and Information Science," showcased the novel work coming out of Doug's Augmented Human Intellect Research Center (AHIRC) at Stanford Research Institute (SRI), now SRI International.

_**Lucky for us,**_ they filmed their 90-minute dress rehearsal in front a live audience. This footage is now available online, along with recently unearthed details and memorabilia.

**The Demo:**  
The ASIS conference kicked off Wednesday afternoon, October 1st, with the Opening General Session, during which Doug Engelbart and his team presented their research in live demonstration format. On Thursday, October 2nd, and Friday, October 3rd, he and his crew hosted an "open house" for conference attendees to meet the team and see the system up close and personal.

Their formal presentation on Wednesday featured Doug on the main stage, with his co-presenters Dave Evans (DAE), Mimi Church (MSC), Bill Paxton (WHP), and Jim Norton (JCN), all videoconferenced in from the lab at SRI 35 miles away. Production and logistics were masterminded by lead engineer Bill English (WKE), ably supported by the remainder of their 24-person team, mostly back at the lab. Nothing about this presentation was routine -- from the equipment setup, video mixing, transmissions between sites over specially arranged microwave link (pre-networking). They had pulled it off once before, and had some dry runs with this current setup, but still the whole production was a huge risk, and it came off beautifully.  
See concluding "Credits" under [Index](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/378/#Index) below, as well as "Opening Remarks" and "Description of presentation setup," for production details and Doug's appreciation.

**Memorabilia:**  
See the [Program Excerpt](https://deiimages.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/asis-1969-program-excerpts.jpeg "Program Excerpts announcing Doug's sessions") describing Doug's sessions (at left), and browse selected pages from the [Conference Program](https://www.dougengelbart.org/images/firsts/1969demo-misc/1969-ASIS-Program-p0-cover.jpg "Conference Program - selected pages") (also at left). Check out Doug's [draft agenda](https://www.dougengelbart.org/images/firsts/1969demo-misc/1969-ASIS-dougs-demo-agenda.jpg "Doug's draft agenda"), a selection of [photos](https://deiimages.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/1969-engelbart-using-hm-workstation.png) from Doug's lab circa 1969 (at right), and the subsequent

**'Prequel' to this Demo:**  
For big-picture background, visit our [Doug's Great Demo: 1968](http://theDemo.org) site for related links and in-depth background on Doug's lab at the time, prior demo, special anniversary events and retrospectives looking back on that demo, Herman Miller's collaboration with Doug on his custom console (also used in this 1969 demo), timelines, plus links to online exhibits at SRI International, Computer History Museum, Stanford University MouseSite, and more.

**Rapid Innovation:** It is quite astounding to note, in less than a year since the 1968 "Mother of All Demos," how considerably their NLS system and its usage have evolved. This is due in large part to Doug's expeditionary  
[Bootstrap Strategy](http://www.dougengelbart.org/firsts/innovation-strategy.html), first detailed in his 1962 'manifesto' [Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework](http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/AugmentingHumanIntellect.html), and [briefly described during his 1968 demo](https://youtu.be/agdPQuFr0yg?start=3&rel=0&showinfo=0). Now you can [watch  
Doug in 1969 relate his research goals and approach](https://youtu.be/Odv_vNFGOX4?start=478&end=747&rel=0&showinfo=0) in more detail. To see for yourself the results of his approach, compare side by side the interactive versions of the [1968 Demo](http://www.dougengelbart.org/firsts/1968-demo-interactive.html) and [1969 Demo](http://www.dougengelbart.org/firsts/1969-demo-interactive.html). Doug continued to refine his innovation strategy through decades of iterative prototyping. Check out Doug's select management seminars and keynotes at our [Engelbart Academy](http://dougengelbart.org/Academy).

**Behold the Dawn of Networking:** Since 1967 Doug's team was involved in ARPA's groundbreaking [ARPANET project](http://dougengelbart.org/firsts/internet.html), the precursor to the Internet, which was scheduled go live in a few short weeks following the 1969 demo. During this demo, Doug shares plans for his team's involvement, including plans for a Network Information Center ("the NIC") which they will be simultantously launching to support the ARPANET community, complete with actual case examples. See our online exhibit [Engelbart's Role in Early Computer Networking](http://www.dougengelbart.org/firsts/internet.html) for story, photos, footage, and more.
