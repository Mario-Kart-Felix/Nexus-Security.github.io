Senior Software Engineer  

===========================

The Company
-----------

Dover is building the first **truly modern recruiting agency**. We help some of the fastest growing companies hire the best talent for their open roles.  

Recruiting is a $50B industry in the US, all the largest agencies still have incredibly manual processes. Recruiters spend countless hours on administrative work, so they have less time to do what they do best: **pitch and close candidates.**  

We've built a better way. Our advanced ML-powered matching software finds the perfect candidates for a particular role, and our NLP outreach system reaches out to those candidates in a highly personalized way. We're automating the entire recruiting stack, from sourcing to scheduling.  

Engineering at Dover
--------------------

The Dover engineering team is small but incredibly effective. We value productivity over face-time, action over inaction, and focus over feature creep.  

As one of our first few engineers, you'll have a massive level of ownership over our engineering culture, end-to-end ownership over the systems that you build, and influence on product direction.  

At the core of what we're building is a simple question—"is person X a good fit for job Y"—but doing this well is challenging, requiring a combination of large-scale data scraping, aggregation and processing. We pride ourselves automating things nobody thought possible.  

Our Stack
---------

We primarily code in Python, with some occasional JavaScript. We leverage Kubernetes heavily for our orchestration and deployment. We also make extensive use of Google Cloud, Docker, Postgres, Mongo, and ElasticSearch within our infrastructure.  

You
---

You're a full-stack or backend engineer with 3+ years of software experience at one or more companies with a strong engineering culture. You're ready to be an individual contributor, design and build sophisticated systems quickly, and work in a fast-paced environment.
