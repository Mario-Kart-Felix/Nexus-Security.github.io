Woodworking is messy business, especially the sanding part. But even if you don’t care what happens to your shop floor, you don’t want dead tree particulate matter in your lungs. Wearing a mask or even a respirator is a good start, but a dust collection system is better. Someday, \[XYZ Create\] might have a shop-wide sawdust-slurper installed. In the meantime, [he made a downdraft table out of scrap plywood and a plastic storage box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPwX_vMyhmU).

The only thing he didn’t already have on hand was a port that matched his shop vacuum. We like his workaround to avoid drilling a huge hole in plastic that would certainly crack — use a hose clamp to get the OD of the port, heat up the clamp on a hot plate, and let it melt a hole into the box. Hopefully, he at least opened a window. \[XYZ Create\] glued four pieces of scrap plywood together for the top, and drilled all 117 holes by hand. Who needs pegboard?

Not fancy or big enough for your needs? [Here’s one with a built-in filtration system](https://hackaday.com/2015/06/23/down-draft-table-keeps-the-shop-dust-free/).
