**Free Download Mobile Detect-Redirect Script With Cookies v1.0.4 from CodeCanyon**. Mobile Detect Script is a simple, lightweight "detect and redirect" script for mobile devices on CodeCanyon. It detects the mobile device, shows the user two options, and, upon choosing it, will either keep it on the same page or redirect it to another website / page. **Mobile Detect-Redirect Script** also set it to forward automatically without confirmation. If users want, the script can remember choosing it for a certain number of days (you can choose the number of days).
