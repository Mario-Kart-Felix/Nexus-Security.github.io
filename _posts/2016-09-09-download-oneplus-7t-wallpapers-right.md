Launched at an event in New Delhi yesterday, the OnePlus 7T is one of the best smartphones in its segment, and you can read our initial impressions of the device by [clicking here](https://beebom.com/oneplus-7t-launched-price-specs-features/). It also comes with a bunch of cool new wallpapers designed by India-based, Sweden-born artist, Hampus Olsson, and feature a clean, fluid style with layered colors and a slightly darker aesthetic than usual.  

There are three static wallpapers that look absolutely stunning, but the phone also includes a bunch of new live wallpapers that come with gorgeous animations. You can check out some of them in the gallery below, but in case you want to download them in glorious 4K, you can do so from [Olsson’s official website](http://www.hampusolsson.com/blog/2019/9/26/oneplus-7t-series-wallpapers).

Noted for his long-standing association with OnePlus, Olsson has also collaborated with other noted companies, such as Spotify and GANT. His association with OnePlus started after meeting the company’s co-founder, Carl Pei, at a weekend market in Goa a few years ago. Impressed with his work, Pei entrusted him with the job of designing the backdrops for the OnePlus 2, and Olsson has been doing the wallpapers for all new OnePlus phones since then.  

If you like Olsson’s designs, you can also download [his own app, Abstract](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hampusolsson.abstruct), which offers more than 300 stunning 4K wallpapers. It includes not only dozens of great new abstract designs, but also all the wallpapers he created for OnePlus over the years, including the latest ones for the OnePlus 7T. The app works on all Android devices running 5.1 Lollipop and above, so you need not own a OnePlus phone to use them.
