From [AISES](https://woc.aises.org/content/dr-henrietta-mann-cheyenne-distinguished-educator-founding-member-aises-council-elders):

> This was an era of activism, and Dr. Mann saw a propitious opening to share information about Native culture and traditions at a public college. “It was here that I found my voice,” she recalls. “I felt inspired to share our wonderful Native ways with the students, the majority of whom were non-Natives. I said to myself, ‘this is where I belong.’”
