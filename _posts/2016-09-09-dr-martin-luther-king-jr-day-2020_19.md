A less popular but very important speech by Dr. King was “The Other America”. This 1967 speech at Stanford touches on the difficulties of the progression of civil rights past the [Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964) and [Voting Rights Act of 1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965). Although this speech was made over 50 years ago, Dr. King’s concerns are still relevant in 2020.
