**Dr. ROBOT - Tool To Enumerate The Subdomains Associated With A Company By Aggregating The Results Of Multiple OSINT Tools**

Dr. ROBOT is a tool for **Domain [Reconnaissance](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Reconnaissance "Reconnaissance") and Enumeration**. By utilizing containers to reduce the overhead of dealing with dependencies, inconsistency across operating sytems, and different languages, Dr. ROBOT is built to be highly portable and configurable.  
**Use Case**: Gather as many public facing servers that a target organization possesses. Querying DNS resources enables us to quickly develop a large list of possible targets that you can run further analysis on.  
**Note**: Dr. ROBOT is not just a one trick pony. You can easily customize the tools that are used gather information, so that you can enjoy the benefits of using latest and greatest along with your battle tested favorites.

    *   infile : (Unique for certain modules) what files this program will use as input to the program. In this case you will notice that it searches /tmp/output for aggregated\_protocol\_hostnames.txt. This file is supplied from the above extra flags option.
*    Web Modules  
    
    *   Example:
    
    ```
    usage: drrobot.py domain serve [-h]  
      
    optional arguments:  
      -h, --help  show this help message and exit  
    
    ```
    
    *   short\_name : quick reference name for use in CLI
    *   class\_name : this must match the name you specify for a given class under the respective module name
        *   The reason behind this results from the loading of modules at runtime which requires the use of importlib. This will load the respective class from the classname provided via the CLI options.
    *   default : false (Disabled for now)
    *   api\_call\_unused : (Old, may be used later...)

**Example Configuration For WebTools**  
Under **configs**, you will find a default\_config that contains a majority of the default scanners you can use. If you wish to extend upon the **WebTools** list just follow these steps:

1.  Add the new tool to the user\_config.json  
    
    ```
     "HTTPScreenshot": {  
            "name" : "HTTPScreenshot",  
            "short_name" : "http",  
            "mode" : "ANSIBLE",  
            "ansible_arguments" : {  
                "config" : "$config/httpscreenshot_play.yml",  
                "flags": "-e '$extra' -i ansible_plays/inventory.yml",  
                "extra_flags":{  
                    "1" : "variable_host=localhost",  
                    "2" : "infile=$infile/aggregated/aggregated_protocol_hostnames.txt",  
                    "3" : "outfile=$outfile/httpscreenshots.tar",  
                    "4" : "outfolder=$outfile/httpscreenshots",  
                    "5" : "variable_user=bitnami"  
                }  
            },  
            "description" : "Post enumeration tool for screen grabbing websites. All images will be downloaded to outfile: httpscreenshot.tar and unpacked httpscreenshots",  
            "output" : "/tmp/output",  
            "infile" : "/tmp/output/aggregated_protocol_hostnames.txt",  
            "   enabled" : false
    ```
    
2.  Open **src/web\_resources.py** and make a class with the **class\_name** specified in the previous step. _**MAKE SURE IT MATCHES EXACTLY**_  
    
    ```
     "HackerTarget" :  
        {  
            "short_name" : "hack",  
            "class_name" : "HackerTarget",  
            "default" : false,  
            "description" : "This query will display the forward DNS records discovered using the data sets outlined above.",  
            "api_call_unused" : "[https://api.hackertarget.com/hostsearch/?q=example.com](https://api.hackertarget.com/hostsearch/?q=example.com)",  
            "output_file" : "hacker.txt"  
        },
    ```
    

  
**Example Configurations For Docker Containers**  
Under **configs**, you will find a **default\_config** which contains a majority of the default scanners you can utilize. If you wish to extend upon the **Scanners** list just follow these steps:

1.  Add the **json** to the **config** file (user if generated).  
    
    ```
    "Serve" : {  
        "name" : "Django",  
        "command" : "python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8888",  
        "docker_name": "django",  
        "network_mode": "host",  
        "default_conf": "serve_api/Dockerfile.Django.tmp",  
        "active_conf": "serve_api/Dockerfile.Django",  
        "description" : "Django container for hosting database",  
        "ports" : {  
            "8888" : "8888"  
         }  
    }
    ```
    
    1.  Note _network\_mode_ is an option specifically for docker containers. It is implementing the `--network` flag when using docker
2.  Under the **docker\_buildfiles/** folder, create your **Dockerfile.NewTool.tmp** dockerfile.  
    1.  If you desire adding more options at run time to the Dockerfiles, look at editing **src/dockerize**
    2.  **Note:** As of right now Dockerfiles must come from the **docker\_buildfiles** folder. Future work includes specifying a remote source for the docker images.

  
**Example Ansible Configuration**  
Under **configs** you will find a **default\_config** which contains a majority of the default scanners you can have. For this step however, we will be looking at configuring an inspection too **Eyewitness** for utilization with **Ansible**.

1.  Add the **json** to the **config** file (user if generated).  
    
    ```
    {  
      "WebTools":  
      {  
        "NewTool" :  
        {  
          "short_name": "ntool",  
          "class_name": "NewTool",  
          "description" : "NewTool description",  
          "output_file" : "newtool.txt",  
          "api_key" : null,  
          "endpoint" : null,  
          "username" : null,  
          "password" : null  
        },
    ```
    
2.  As you can see, this has a few items that may seem confusing at first, but will be clarified here:  
    1.  mode: Allows you to specify how you want to deploy a tool you want to use. Currently **DOCKER** or **ANSIBLE** are the only available methods to deploy.
    2.  All options outside of **ansible\_configuration** will be ignored when developing for **ANSIBLE**.
    3.  Options under _ansible\_arguments_  
        1.  **config**: specify which playbook to use
        2.  **flags**: which flags to pass to the **ansible-playbook** command. With the exception of the **$extra** flag, you can add anything you would like to be done uniquely here.
        3.  **extra\_flags** : this corresponds to the **$extra** flag as seen above. This will be used to populate variables that you input into your playbook. You can use this to supply [command line](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Command%20Line "command line") arguments when utilizing ansible and Dr. Robot in order to add files and other utilities to your script.  
            
            1.  **variable\_host** : hostname alias found in the inventory file
            2.  **variable\_user** : user to login as on the variable\_host machine
            3.  **infile**: file to be used with the tool above. Eyewitness requires hostnames with the format `[https://some.url](https://some.url/)`, hence _aggregated\_protocol\_hostnames.txt_
            4.  Note the use of the prefix **$infile**\- these names all match as they are placeholders for the default locations that **$infile** corresponds to in **outputs/target\_name/aggregated**
            5.  If you have a file in another location you can just specify the entire path without any errors occurring.
            6.  **outfile** : The output file location
            7.  As with the above infile **$outfile** in the name is just a key to the location **outputs/target\_name/**
            8.  You may specify a hard coded path for other use. Just remember the location for uploading or other processing with Dr. Robot
            9.  **outfolder** : The output folder to unpack/download files too
            10.  As with the above infile **$outfile** in the name is just a key to the location **outputs/target\_name/**
            11.  This is a special case for Eyewitness and HttpScreenshot, which you can see in their playbooks. They generate a lot of files and rather than download each individually having them pack up the files as a step in the playbook and then unpacking allows for some integrity.
            12.  A quick example below shows how we use the **extra\_flags** to supply the hostname to the playbook for ansible.
            
            ```
            class NewTool(WebTool):  
             def __init__(self, **kwargs):  
                 super().__init__(**kwargs)  
                 ....  
             def do_query(self):  
                 .... do the query ...   
                 store results in  
                 self.results
            ```
            

  
**Docker Integration and Customization**  
Docker is relied upon heavily for this tool to function.  
All Docker files will have a **default\_conf** and an **active\_conf**.

  
**default\_conf** represents the template that will be used for generation of the docker files. The reason for building the docker images is to allow for finer control on the user end, especially if you are in a more restricted environment without access to the docker repositories.  
**active\_conf** represents the configuration which will be build into the current image.  
**example Dockerfile.tmp**

```
"Scanners" : {  
 ...  
    "NewTool": {  
        "name": "NewTool",  
        "default" : true,   
        "mode" : DOCKER,  
        "docker_name": "ntool",  
        "network_mode": "host",  
        "default_conf": "docker_buildfiles/Dockerfile.NewTool.tmp",  
        "active_conf": "docker_buildfiles/Dockerfile.NewTool",  
        "description": "NewTool is an awesome tool for domain enumeration",  
        "src": "[https://github.com/NewTool](https://github.com/NewTool)",  
        "output": "/home/newtool",  
        "output_file": "NewTool.txt"  
      },  
      ...  
}
```

We use **ENV** to keep track of most variable input from Python on the user end.  
Using the **DNS** information provided by the user we are able to download packages and git repos during building.  
  
**Ansible Configuration**  
Please see the ansible documentation: [https://docs.ansible.com/](https://docs.ansible.com/ "https://docs.ansible.com/") for details on how to develop a playbook for use with DrRobot.  
  
**Inventory**  
Ansible inventory files will be self contained within DrRobot so as to further seperate itself from any one system. The inventory file will be located under **configs/ansible\_inventory**  
As noted in the documentation ansible inventory can be defined as groups or single IP's. A quick example:

  

```
"Enumeration" : {  
        "Eyewitness": {  
            "name" : "Eyewitness",  
            "short_name" : "eye",  
            "docker_name" : "eye",  
            "mode" : "ANSIBLE",  
            "network_mode": "host",  
            "default_conf" : "docker_buildfiles/Dockerfile.Eyewitness.tmp",  
            "active_conf" : "docker_buildfiles/Dockerfile.Eyewitness",  
            "ansible_arguments" : {  
                "config" : "$config/eyewitness_play.yml",  
                "flags": "-e '$extra' -i ansible_plays/inventory",  
                "extra_flags":{  
                    "1" : "variable_host=localhost",  
                    "2" : "variable_user=root",  
                    "3" : "infile=$infile/aggregated_protocol_hostnames.txt",  
                    "4" : "outfile=$outfile/Eyewitness.tar",  
                    "5" : "outfolder=$outfile/Eyewitness"  
                }  
            },  
            "desc   ription" : "Post enumeration tool for screen grabbing websites. All images will be downloaded to outfile: Eyewitness.tar and unpacked in Eyewitness",  
            "output" : "/tmp/output",  
            "infile" : "/tmp/output/aggregated/aggregated_protocol_hostnames.txt",  
            "enabled" : false  
        },  
}
```

  
**SSH + Ansible**  
If you desire to run Ansible with this tool and require ssh authentication be done you can use the application as is to run Ansible scripts. The plays will be piped to STDIN/STDOUT so that you may supply credentials if required.  
If you wish to have to not manually provide credentials just use an **ssh-agent**

```
---  
- hosts: "{{ variable_host|quote }}"  
  remote_user: root   
  
  tasks:  
      - name: Apt install git  
        become: true  
        apt:  
            name: git  
            force: yes
```

  
  
  
**Adding Docker Containers**  
If you wish to add another Dockerfile to the project make a **Dockerfile.toolname.tmp** file within the **docker\_buildfiles** folder. Then opening up your **user\_config** add a new section under the appropriate section as shown above in the \[docker\](#Example Configurations For Docker Containers)  
  
**Dependencies**

*    **Docker** required for any of the scanners to run
*    **Python 3.6** required  
    *    **Pipenv** for versioning of all Python packages. You can use the Pipfile with setup.py [requirements](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Requirements "requirements") as well.  
        
        ```
        FROM python:3.4  
          
        WORKDIR /home  
        ENV http_proxy $proxy  
        ENV https_proxy $proxy  
        ENV DNS $dns  
        ENV TARGET $target  
        ENV OUTPUT $output  
          
        RUN mkdir -p $$OUTPUT  
          
        RUN if [ -n "$$DNS" ]; then echo "nameserver $DNS" > /etc/resolv.conf; fi; apt-get install git  
          
        RUN if [ -n "$$DNS" ]; then echo "nameserver $DNS" > /etc/resolv.conf; fi; git clone [https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r.git](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r.git) /home/sublist  
          
        WORKDIR /home/sublist  
          
        RUN if [ -n "$$DNS" ]; then echo "nameserver $DNS" > /etc/resolv.conf; fi; pip3 install -r requirements.txt  
          
        ENTRYPOINT python3 sublist3r.py --domain $target -o $output/sublist3r.txt
        ```
        
*    **Ansible** if you require the use of external servers.
*    **Python Mattermost Driver** \[Optional\] if using Mattermost you will require this module

  
**Output**  
**Gather** : when ran will produce an output similar to:

```
[example-host]  
[ip.example.com](http://ip.example.com/)
```

You will also notice a **sqlite** file found under the **dbs** folder (You can specify alternative db filenames):

```
eval $(ssh-agent -s)  
ssh-add /path/to/sshkey
```

**Inspect**: when ran will continue to add files to the output folder. If you provided a domain file under the db section the domain folder will be created for you. The output will look similar to the above but with some added contents:

```
cd /path/to/drrobot/  
pipenv install && pipenv shell  
python drrobot.py   target
```

  
**Slack**  
Please check the following for a guide on how to setup your Python bot for messaging.  
[https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient](https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient "https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient")  
  
**SQLite DB file schema**  
Table Data: | domainid | INTEGER | PRIMARY KEY | -------- | ------- | | ip | VARCHAR | | hostname | VARCHAR | | headers | VARCHAR | | http\_headers | TEXT | | https\_headers| TEXT | | domain | VARCHAR | FOREIGN KEY  
Table Domain: | domain | VARCHAR | PRIMARY KEY | -------- | ------- |  
  
**Serve**  
As is often the case, having an API can be nice for automation purposes. Under the serve-api folder, there is a simple Django server implementation that you can stand up locally or serve via Docker. In order to serve the datak, you need to copy your database folder to the root directory of **serve-api** and rename the file to **drrobot.db**. If you would like to use an alternative name, simply change the name in the Django **serve\_\_\_\_-api/drrobot/drrobot/settings.py**.
