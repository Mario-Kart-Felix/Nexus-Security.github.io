Dr. Nowoverandout on Twitter ([@NowOverAndOut](https://twitter.com/NowOverAndOut/status/1214721327548043265)) posts about her work with [@SyntheticFuture](https://twitter.com/SyntheticFuture) on a Dr. Who ePaper ID badge. It uses an [Adafruit Feather Bluefruit microcontroller](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2995) and lovely [eInk display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4224).

It will have several pre-programmed IDs that can be displayed as needed.

See [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/NowOverAndOut/status/1214721327548043265) for details.

Nicely done, let us know how you get along and how itâ€™s programmed (CircuitPython?)
