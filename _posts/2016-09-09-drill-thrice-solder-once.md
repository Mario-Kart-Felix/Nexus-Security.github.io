If you design printed circuit boards, then you will have also _re_designed printed circuit boards. Nobody gets it right the first time, every time. Sometimes you can solder a scrap of 30gauge wire, flip a component 180°, or make a TO-92 transistor do that little pirouette thing where the legs go every-which-way. If you angered the PCB deities, you may have to [access a component pad far from an edge](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkx/blog/3127). \[Nathan Seidle\], the founder of Sparkfun, finds himself in this situation, but all hope is not lost.

Our first thought is to desolder everything, then take a hot iron and tiny wires to each pad. Of course, this opens up a lot of potential for damage to the chip, cold joints, and radio interference. Accessing the pin in vivo has risks, but they are calculated. The idea is to locate the pin, then systematically drill from the backside and expose the copper. \[Nate\] also discovers that alcohol will make the PCB transparent so you can peer at the underside to confirm you have found your mark.

In a real, “fight fire with fire” idea, you can [rework with flex PCBs](https://hackaday.com/2019/12/17/tidy-board-rework-uses-flex-pcbs-no-wires/) or push your PCB Fu to the next level and use [PCBs as your enclosure](https://hackaday.com/2019/09/16/the-benefits-and-pitfalls-of-using-pcbs-as-an-enclosure/).
