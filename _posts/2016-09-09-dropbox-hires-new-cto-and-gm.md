We’re sharing the news today that Quentin Clark is stepping down from his role as CTO of Dropbox at the end of the year. He has been a driving force in our business during his time here, and we’re grateful for all that he has done.

Quentin joined Dropbox to lead our Engineering, Product, and Design (EPD) teams in building the next major iteration of our core product, which we did with the introduction of [Dropbox Spaces](https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/product/introducing-dropbox-spaces). He was also charged with up-leveling the EPD organization to operate at public company scale. Over the last two years, he’s built an incredibly strong team. With these accomplishments under his belt, Quentin is passing the baton to two new leaders who will join Dropbox at the end of the month.

We’re excited to announce that **Bharat Mediratta** and **Tim Young** are joining our leadership team. We believe the unique talent and expertise they bring will help Dropbox in our pursuit to make work a calmer, and more focused experience for our customers.

*   **Bharat Mediratta will take on the role of CTO and SVP, Platform**. Bharat has decades of experience as a technical leader at global scale. He was a distinguished engineer at Google for 10+ years, recipient of multiple Founders’ Awards, and responsible for re-architecting Search. He later became co-founder and president of AltSchool, an education tech company. At Dropbox, he’ll oversee our technical infrastructure, ITS, Security, and Intelligence teams. In addition, he’ll lead the teams responsible for our partnership ecosystem, Dropbox Paper, and HelloSign.

*   **Timothy Young will take on the role of SVP and GM, Core Dropbox.** Tim is an experienced technologist, product leader, and former entrepreneur. He founded multiple successful companies including Socialcast, an enterprise collaboration platform which was acquired by VMware. At VMware, he was VP of Product and Engineering, running numerous global teams within the company’s end-user and mobile computing business units. At Dropbox, he’ll oversee all the teams responsible for improving the core product experience for our customers, including Dropbox Spaces, and our mobile, web, and desktop apps.

We’re thrilled to have both leaders on board and look forward to benefiting from their experience. They bring the energy and innovation that comes from a track record of entrepreneurship, as well as the discipline and rigor of skilled operators who’ve led large-scale engineering organizations. We’re excited for Tim and Bharat to help us realize our vision of building the world’s first [smart](https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/dropbox--the-smart-workspace) [workspace](https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/dropbox--the-smart-workspace).
