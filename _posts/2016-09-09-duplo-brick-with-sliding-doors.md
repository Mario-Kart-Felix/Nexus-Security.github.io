---------------------------------------------------------------------------

> A duplo brick with a pair of sliding doors. A must have for every sliding doors connosieur.
> 
> They can be used standalone, to build a station with station doors, or to build a traincar with 4 pairs of sliding doors using a standard Duplo train platform.

> I’m sorry but the SCAD file is really how’ya’doin because I had to do it during very short breaks over a long period of time. There are many things that I would like to improve, but meanwhile I save this here for you to build and play.
> 
> In my experience, the tolerances are pretty tight. With my printer, I have to deburr the bottom edges heavily in order for the doors not to bind. If they seem to bind anyway, try to see what makes them stop and remove it.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!

The [Adafruit Learning System](http://learn.adafruit.com) has dozens of great tools to get you well on your way to creating incredible works of engineering, interactive art, and design with your 3D printer! If you’ve made a cool project that combines 3D printing and electronics, be sure to let us know, and we’ll [feature](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) it here!
