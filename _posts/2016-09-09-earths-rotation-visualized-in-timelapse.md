> Although the Earth rotates below the sky, aerial time-lapse videos often have the perspective of a celestial scene rushing above the ground. In this brief video by [Aryeh Nirenberg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSfs8wY4g32C0gVt0yyH7Ig), the Milky Way becomes completely stationary, highlighting specifically the Earth’s rotation. Nirenberg recorded the time-lapse with a Sony a7SII with the Canon 24-70mm f2.8 lens while using an equatorial tracking mount over a period of three hours. You can see more of his starscapes on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/art_only/) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSfs8wY4g32C0gVt0yyH7Ig).
