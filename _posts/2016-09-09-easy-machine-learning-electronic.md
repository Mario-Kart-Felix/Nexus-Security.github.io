Teachable Machine is a new free service for TensorFlow experimentation that takes the pain out of training models ([video](https://youtu.be/j43MLLRkTiE)). In just a few moments you can get video data for image recognition, train a model and export it for use with TF or TF Lite. Here we use a mod of ‘tiny sorter’ to send WebUSB signal to a Circuit Playground Express to light up LEDs based on which class was detected.
