Whether it’s an important discussion with your colleagues or a brainstorming session with your business partner, there are times when you might want to keep a record of your conversations so that you can refer to them later. That said, since call recording is illegal in many countries, Apple does not include a call recording app with its iPhones. However, if you need such functionality, there are plenty of apps on the App store which can help you record voice calls on the iPhone. However, choosing one might be difficult as most of them claim to do the same thing. Well, worry not, as we have tested and made a list of the some of the best call recording apps you can use on your iPhone:  

_**Note****:** Many of the call recording apps share a similar name so be sure to download the apps from the provided links only. Also, since call recording is illegal in many countries, please check your country’s regulations before trying these apps out. All these apps should be compatible with the latest iOS, that is iOS 11 and even older iOS versions and also the last iPhone X, iPhone 8 and even older phones.

1\. TapeACall Pro
-----------------

  

TapeACall Pro is probably the best call recording app which you can use today. The app makes it pretty simple to record any calls. Once you are on a call, just tap on the recording button and **the app will create a three-way conference call where the third-line is being used to record the call**. In my testing, the app worked every time and recordings sounded clear for both sides. The app also lets you share the recording via social media or email. You can even choose to upload the recordings to a cloud storage (Google Drive and Dropbox) if you want to save storage on your iPhone.  

![1. TapeACall Pro](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1.-TapeACall-Pro.jpg)

However, the best part of using TapeACall Pro is that the app charges a flat fee. **For $3.99/month or $19.99/year, you can record unlimited calls without a cap on the call duration**. It is best for someone who likes to conduct long telephonic interviews. The app has a free version which allows you to use the app for a **7-day trial period**, after which you are required to pay the aforementioned charges if you want to keep using this app.  

_**Download:** TapeACall Pro ([Free](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tapeacall-lite-call-recorder/id573751328?mt=8) / [subscription starts at $3.99/month](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tapeacall-pro-record-phone/id577499909?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8))_  

2\. Call Recorder – Int Call
----------------------------

  

Call Recorder – Int Call is another great call recording app for iPhones. **Just like TapeACall Pro, the app worked perfectly fine on all the devices that I tested it on**. That said, their similarity ends here. The app handles both the recording and pricing very differently from TapeACall Pro. Firstly, for the app to be able to record phone calls, you will need to dial the number using the app’s built-in dial pad.

  
  

  

![2. Call Recorder - Int Call](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2.-Call-Recorder-Int-Call.jpg)

For recording the incoming calls, one needs to first open the app and then follow the on-screen instructions, which makes it a little harder to record the incoming calls. That said, the feature works perfectly fine. The app lets you save the recordings on your phone or upload it to Google Drive or Dropbox. You can also email the recorded conversation to yourself if you choose to do so. When it comes to pricing, **the app charges you 10 cents/minute to record your call and sadly this charge can vary depending on your country**. The app does give you 30 cents in credit to get you started.

3\. Call Recorder for iPhone
----------------------------

  

Call Recorder for iPhone is another app that works great when recording your incoming and outgoing calls. **The app gives you high-quality recordings, with clear voices from both sides of conversations**. Just like TapeACall Pro, the app uses a conference call system to record your calls. However, you do need to call a person from inside the app to record the calls.  

![3. Call Recorder for iPhone](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/3.-Call-Recorder-for-iPhone.jpg)

Once you call a person using the app, you will have to wait for a few seconds until the merge calls option is ready to be enabled. Once it’s available, you can just tap on the merge calls button and the call will be recorded. The app gives you a clear visual cue by showing the recording time so that you know that the call is, in fact, being recorded. That said, **the service is a little pricier at $7.99/month**. However, if you decide to pay for a year, it will only cost you $4.16/month.  

_**Download:** Call Recorder for iPhone ([Free trial](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/call-recorder-for-iphone/id1200776424?mt=8), $7.99/month)_  

4\. Call Recorder Lite
----------------------

  

Call recorder Lite is a free app which lets you record both the incoming and outgoing calls. It uses the same three-way call merge system to record your calls as we have seen with previous apps. **To record a call, you need to first open the app and then tap on the record call button**. Here, the app will first dial the recording number and once it’s connected you can dial the number you want to call. As soon as you merge both the calls, your call will start getting recorded.  

![4. Call Recorder Lite](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/4.-Call-Recorder-Lite.jpg)

  
  

  

Other features include the ability to upload the calls to Dropbox or Google Drive and share calls via emails, iMessage, or Twitter. The **free version lets you record unlimited calls**, however, it only lets you listen to the first 60 seconds of recording. The pro version of the app sells for $9.99 which gives you a credit worth 300 minutes. If you want additional minutes, you will need to buy it from the app.  

_**Download:** Call Recorder Lite ([Free](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/call-recorder-free-record/id637819447?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo=8) / [$9.99](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/call-recorder-pro-record-phone-calls-for-iphone/id644933412?mt=8))_  

5\. Call Recorder Unlimited
---------------------------

  

**Call Recorder Unlimited is eerily similar to our top pick, TapeACall Pro**. The app not only uses the similar three-way calling system to record the calls, but it has also priced its services to reflect the same price as asked by the TapeACall Pro app. Not only that even its setup process and the way it displays its pro pricing is the same.  

![5. Call Recorder Unlimited](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/5.-Call-Recorder-Unlimited.jpg)

But don’t just take my word for it, check out the pictures above and decide for yourself. That said, thankfully, the app also brings all the same features which mean **it works flawlessly and allows you to upload calls to cloud storages** and share them using a variety of means including emails and social media. If for some reason, TapeACall Pro is not working out for you, be sure to check out Call Recorder unlimited.  

_**Download:** Call Recorder Unlimited ([Free](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/call-recorder-unlimited/id1169625397?mt=8), pricing starts at $3.99/month)_  

6\. CallRec Lite
----------------

  

Just like Call Recorder Unlimited is eerily similar to TapeACall Pro, CallRec Lite is extremely similar to Call Recorder Lite. It has all the similar features, including **3-way merge call recording, the ability to upload calls to cloud storages including Google Drive** and Dropbox, and multiple sharing options such as emails and social media channels. However, what makes the similarity scream is its pricing strategy.  

![6. CallRec Lite](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/6.-CallRec-Lite-.jpg)

The **app’s free version lets you record unlimited calls but only lets you listen to the first 60-seconds of recorded call**. You need to buy the pro version if you want to listen to the whole call. However, instead of charging $9.99 for the pro version, it charges you $8.99. Also, I could not find any time limit for the pro version, so it seems that once you have paid, you can record as many calls, for as long as you want, which makes it the cheapest call recording app on the list. That said, **it only supports a handful of countries including and not limited to** Argentina, Australia, Canada, US, Chile, Brazil, Israel, Mexico, and Poland.

  
  

  

_**Download:** CallRec Lite ([Free](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/callrec-lite-record-phone-calls/id645245002?mt=8), pro upgrade for $8.99)_  

7\. Call Recording by NoNotes
-----------------------------

  

Call Recording by NoNotes **takes the whole call recording game one step further and includes an option to transcribe the recorded calls**. The app lets you record both incoming and outgoing calls. You also get all the usual features like save recorded calls in the cloud, share via Facebook or email, and more. Other added features include option to transcribe, use the app for dictation, and QR code to file for playback.  

![7. Call Recording by NoNotes](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/7.-Call-Recording-by-NoNotes.jpg)

When it comes to pricing, you get free call recording for 20 minutes/month after which you will have to pay for the service. The call recording feature will cost $10/month ($8 if you pay yearly), and the **transcription service will cost you anywhere between 75¢/min to $423/10 hour**. The app is currently only available in North America and US.

8\. Call Recorder for iPhone Calls
----------------------------------

  

Call Recorder for iPhone Calls is a great app which makes it really easy to record voice calls on your iPhone. **The best part of the app is that you don’t even require a SIM card for it to work**. It uses its own online services to connect the call. You can use the app to make local as well as international calls. The app promises to deliver a high-quality recording experience with plethora of options to share the calls via different social media apps, emails, cloud storages, and more.  

![8. Call Recorder for iPhone Calls](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/8.-Call-Recorder-for-iPhone-Calls.jpg)

The app charges you **6 coins/minute** of every call that you record. Depending on how many coins you are buying **the prices can vary from 99 cents for 99 coins to $99 for 10998 coins**. It’s one of the best call recording apps you can get for your iPhones. If you are happy with its pricing, do give this one a try.

9\. ipadio
----------

  

iPadio is a nifty free app which not only lets you record calls but any other audio too. When you make an account on ipadio, an online account at ipadio.com will also be created for you. **Once you want to record your calls, you will need to first call one of ipadio’s local numbers and enter your unique PIN**. You can then add a call and merge the two, meaning both sides of the conversation will be recorded and the audio will automatically appear in your online account. You can visit your online account to download and share your recorded calls. The app is a little bit harder to use and may fail to work sometimes, but on the flip side, it’s totally free.

_**Download:** ipadio ([Free](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/ipadio/id316553962?mt=8))_  

10\. iRec Call Recorder for iPhone

Last on our list iRec Call Recorder, which like most other apps on this list is a freemium app. The app lets you record both outgoing and incoming call with ease. It **also allows you to make cheap international calls using its services**. Although I didn’t use the feature, the app also claims to offer a transcription service just as the one by NoNotes. **The service cost your $9.99/month if you pay on a yearly basis**.
