Nowhere in the first episode of [The Mandalorian](https://www.cnet.com/news/the-mandalorian-everything-we-know-about-the-new-star-wars-show-on-disney-plus/) does the main character eat or drink anything. We get to see [where he goes to the bathroom](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-mandalorian-teaches-us-how-to-poop-in-space/1100-6471380/), but the Disney+ series doesn't let us know what his favorite foods are. Well, there's a new cookbook, based on the theme park Galaxy's Edge, that gives us deeper insight into the world of Mandalore and it's food.

You've probably watched the first episode of [The Mandalorian](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-the-mandalorians-name-revealed-its-not-b/1100-6471409/) already, but have you done so while eating food? If you really want to roleplay while enjoying the Disney+ series, why not cook yourself something inspired by the fine warrior people of Mandalore? Insight Editions newest cookbook--available now--has plenty of meals and drinks you can make for yourself at home, all inspired by the stories and cuisine from Galaxy's Edge. Insight Editions gave us a look at Spicy Mandalorian Stew if you want to cook it up for yourself.
