Young fashion designer Egypt “Ify” Ufele made an exciting debut at NYFW in 2018. She also started the charity Bully Chasers to support children who face bullying. Her entrepreneurship and powerful message are an inspiration to many.

[CNN covered](https://www.cnn.com/2016/02/18/living/child-fashion-designer-nyfw-feat/) Ify’s story back in 2018:

> A 10-year-old fashion prodigy is standing against bullies from her school by debuting her size-inclusive clothing label at New York Fashion Week.
> 
> Egypt Ufele, who goes by “Ify,” started designing clothes to cope with bullies who taunted her about her weight at her school in the Queens borough of New York.
> 
> “I was bullied, and they called me all kinds of names. One time I got stabbed with a pencil,” Ufele told NBC’s “Today.”
> 
> At first, Ify just made outfits for her dolls. Then she started cranking out women’s and girls’ clothing for all shapes and sizes with her grandmother’s sewing machine.
