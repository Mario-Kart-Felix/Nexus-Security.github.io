> Gomel, Belarus-based origami artist [Arseni Kazhamiakin](https://www.instagram.com/arsenikoom/) creates transfixing tessellations using colorful sheets of paper. The artist has been creating his own designs since 2013, and notes that he uses everyday paper “of questionable quality.” Each completed work is meticulously documented from above, and some works are illuminated from behind to show the hidden interior layers. Kazhamiakin explains that there is not much of an origami community in Gomel, and he hopes that by connecting with other folders online to build more of a local network. The artist shares his finished work on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/arseniyko) and shows more details and in-progress projects on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/arsenikoom/).
