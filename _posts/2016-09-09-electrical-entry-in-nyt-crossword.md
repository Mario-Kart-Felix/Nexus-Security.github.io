[Deb Amlen](https://www.nytimes.com/by/deb-amlen), New York Times crossword columnist and senior staff editor of [Wordplay](https://www.nytimes.com/column/wordplay), [writes about](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/crosswords/heck-ampere-crosswords-electrical.html) the entry that stumped many puzzlers October 22nd, but would be known to many Adafruit readers: Ampere! Here Adafruit provides the answer for Deb:

> The electrical measurement known as the AMPERE, or “amp,” has appeared in the New York Times Crossword 103 times, yet many solvers missed this entry in the Tuesday, Oct. 22 crossword puzzle. Let’s take a closer look at it and the way it might be clued so solvers are more likely to get it next time.
> 
> An AMPERE is the base unit of electric current in the International System of Units, or SI.
> 
> “In practical terms,” says the electronics educational website [Adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/), “the AMPERE is a measure of the amount of electric charge passing a point in an electric circuit per unit time.” It was named after André-Marie Ampére (1775-1836), who is considered to be the father of electrodynamics.
> 
> The AMPERE is an important part of the useful equation known as Ohm’s law, which helps calculate the voltage, amperage or resistance in an electrical circuit. It is expressed as V (for voltage) = I (for AMPEREs) x R (for resistance).
