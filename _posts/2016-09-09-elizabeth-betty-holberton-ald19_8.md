Frances Elizabeth “Betty” Holberton was one of the six original programmers of the first general-purpose electronic digital computer, [ENIAC.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC "ENIAC") She also invented [breakpoints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint "Breakpoint") in computer [debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging "Debugging")

From [Wikipedia](https://ethw.org/Marlyn_Meltzer):

> She was one of those who wrote the first generative programming system ([SORT/MERGE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_sort_merge "Mainframe sort merge")). Holberton used a deck of playing cards to develop the decision tree for the binary sort function, and wrote the code to employ a group of ten tape drives to read and write data as needed during the process. She wrote the first statistical analysis package, which was used for the 1950 US Census.
> 
> In 1953 she was made a supervisor of advanced programming in a part of the Navy’s Applied Math lab in Maryland, where she stayed until 1966. Holberton worked with [John Mauchly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mauchly "John Mauchly") to develop the C-10 instruction set for [BINAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BINAC "BINAC"), which is considered to be the prototype of all modern programming languages. She also participated in the development of early standards for the [COBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL "COBOL") and [FORTRAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FORTRAN "FORTRAN") programming languages with [Grace Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper "Grace Hopper"). Later, as an employee of the [National Bureau of Standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bureau_of_Standards "National Bureau of Standards"), she was very active in the first two revisions of the Fortran language standard (“FORTRAN 77” and “Fortran 90”).

Happy [Ada Lovelace Day!](http://findingada.com) Today, in honor of Ada Lovelace, the world celebrates all of the accomplishments of women in science, art, design, technology, engineering, and math. Each year, [Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/random/ald/) highlights a number of women who are pioneering their fields and inspiring women of all ages to make their voices heard. Today we will be sharing the stories of women that we think are modern day “Adas” alongside historical women that have made impacts in science and math.
