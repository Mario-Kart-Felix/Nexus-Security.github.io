It’s always good to have a torch on hand for emergencies. Unfortunately, sometimes these torches can be forgotten, and wind up with dead batteries when you need them most. For those cases, [this build from \[techrallyofficial\] is just the ticket.](https://www.instructables.com/id/Emergency-LED-Torch-Without-Battery/#C5XK4N8K5F4HT30)

Instead of a battery, the torch relies on a 1.5 farad supercapacitor to store energy. The body of the torch is constructed out of PVC pipe and fittings, and packs strong neodymium magnets inside. A coil of wire wrapped is formed around an old solder spool, which, when shaken past the magnets, generates a current. This is rectified with a series of diodes and charges the supercapacitor, powering the light.

It’s a classic design that is available commercially, but it’s one easily replicated in the home shop, too. It would make a great educational project, particularly as students would be left with a useful device to take home at the end of the lesson. [We’ve seen others resurrect commercial builds with upgrades, too.](https://hackaday.com/2013/06/21/giving-a-crank-flashlight-a-super-capacitor-overhaul/) Video after the break.
