Andrew Kleindolph on Extrasleepy discusses a recent project.

> **Engineered Sandwich** is a small rechargeable freestanding light-emitting sculpture. A translucent 3D-printed lens press fits between two hand-finished wood buns. A [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) controller randomly changes RGB LEDs, continuously projecting a cool gradient on all sides of the lens and through a series of slots at the top of the piece. The shape and title are inspired by the ongoing advances in plant-based meat products.
> 
> The lamp can operate plugged to a USB outlet or untethered for 3 hours per recharge.

CNC-cut cherry, 3D-printed lens, Acrylic, Microcontroller, Addressable LEDs, Rechargeable battery
