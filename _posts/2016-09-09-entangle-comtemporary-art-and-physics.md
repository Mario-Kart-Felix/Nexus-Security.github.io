> Entangle. Physics and the Artistic Imagination, a book edited by Ariane Koek, with essays by science writer Philip Ball, Ariane Koek, art historian Gavin Parkinson, physicist Carlo Rovelli, curator and historian Nicola Triscott. Graphic design by Maria Persson.

In her introductory essay, curator Ariane Koek articulates the mutual benefits physics and art can draw from each other. Physicists, she argues, allow artists to observe the world under a new lens. Conversely, artists allow all of us to see the world under a different light and help us make sense of our place in the world. Both expand our horizons, make use of imagination and don’t hesitate to probe the limits of knowledge.
