Environmental groups Seas At Risk and Transport and Environment have announced the results of a study they commissioned to Reynolds Environmental Sustainability Consultants (RESC). A paper written by the team at RESC has been posted to the Seas At Risk site. In it, the researchers describe their findingsâ€”namely that their evidence that implementing speed limits on ships around the world would reduce the industry's carbon footprint, and would also reduce air pollution. They noted that reducing speeds would also lower deaths of whales due to collisions with ships.
