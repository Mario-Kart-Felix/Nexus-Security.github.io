> I have bought a couple of ESP-01S boards without any project really in my mind. But recently I have discovered cool looking WS2812B (Neopixel) adapters for these boards, so that gave me an idea for a project.

> After several iterations I have developed little device, that enables to control WS2812B strips/rings either throught web interface, through MQTT commands or through REST API. It has also one button, that can switch various colors and effects.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
