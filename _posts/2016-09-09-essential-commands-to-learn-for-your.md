Handy guide for working with your Pi!

Via [PC Mag](https://www.pcmag.com/feature/370969/essential-commands-to-learn-for-your-raspberry-pi-projects/4):

> Getting your Raspberry Pi [up and running](https://www.pcmag.com/news/370245/beginners-guide-how-to-get-started-with-raspberry-pi) is pretty easy—and whatever project you’re doing, there’s probably a guide that can walk you through the process. But a few tools and terminal commands you’ll use in almost every Pi endeavor.
> 
> Since most Pi projects run on Linux, having some command-line chops makes the Pi much easier to work with. But even if you aren’t a Linux veteran, these commands can teach you a lot as you tinker, so it’s a good idea to become familiar with them now.
