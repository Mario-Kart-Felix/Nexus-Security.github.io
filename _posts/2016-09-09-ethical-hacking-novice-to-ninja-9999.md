### Description:

Kali is a flavor of Linux targeted at digital forensics experts and Penetration Testers. It includes over 400 pen-testing programs, and is the primary tool used by ethical hackers. Using Kali Linux, certified ethical hackers can test networks on their organizations’ behalves, to determine if they’re susceptible to internal and external attacks.  
Businesses are connected, and as such, they’re also exposed. Vulnerability testing helps organizations limit that exposure. This course will help you explore the techniques, and tools of the trade.
