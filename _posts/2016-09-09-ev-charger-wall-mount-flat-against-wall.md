> Wall mount for electric car charger connector. This lets the connector lay along the wall and angle down at 45 degrees to relieve wire strain. Should fit any standard US J1772 EV connector. Works great for my Smart ForTwo ED.
> 
> Print with 3-4 perimeters and 10-15% infill for strength. You will need fairly long screws to get this through the piece and into a stud or brick. I would not recommend screwing straight into drywall. If you do, make sure you have solid anchors. Rotate model in slicer per your printers best orientation.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
