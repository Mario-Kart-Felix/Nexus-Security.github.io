A team that is tracking Eagles racked up a massive data bill. When one of their subjects flew further than expected, the roaming charges temporarily shut down the project.

Via [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/26/world/europe/eagles-data-roaming-charges.html):

> 
> He suddenly sent hundreds of backlogged text messages at once as he flew from Kazakhstan, where rates are cheaper, to Iran, where they are more expensive, a researcher said.

> The bird breeds in southern Russia and in Kazakhstan, but their yearly migration can take them as far as India, the Middle East and Africa.
