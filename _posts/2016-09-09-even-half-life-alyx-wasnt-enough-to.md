It’s non stunning {that a} Sony worker would tweet inward protection of VR. In any case, Sony discharged a VR headset for its soothe across iii eld agone, and has chronic that this headset testament [continue to work](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18401209/sony-playstation-5-details-8k-graphics-ray-tracing-ssds-ps4-backward-compatibility) with issues approaching PlayStation 5.

  

Issues Xbox make, meantime, has had a more than discrepant kinship with VR across issues eld. Once issues Xbox Leak X was first proclaimed below issues Projection Scorpius codename, Microsoft proudly boasted that it could live highly effective plenty to back up issues self sort of “[high-end VR](https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11890842/microsoft-xbox-project-scorpio-virtual-reality-e3-2016)” disengaged along issues PC platform.

At present, it sounds lips issues state of affairs isn’t owed to alter arsenic Microsoft strikes into issues succeeding soothe era. And {unfortunately}, fifty-fifty acquiring an betimes appear astatine leak of VR’s most anticipated titles wasn’t plenty to alter Spencer’s view.
