Microsoft is really ready to reset this console generation. After the sluggish era of the Xbox One, the company is primed to take everything they’ve learned, take all of their fan-pleasing initiatives, to a new box without any DRM baggage. Besides, [Xbox Scarlett](https://www.geek.com/games/playstation-5-vs-xbox-project-scarlett-everything-we-know-about-next-gen-consoles-1792542/) is launching with _Halo: Infinite_, so how bad could it really go?

  

However, at the X019 Xbox fan event, we didn’t learn anything about future hardware. Instead, we learned more about future games theoretically still coming to Xbox consoles (and PCs) you can buy now. Check out these exclusives signs of Xbox life.

  

  

I think it’s still arguable whether or not Nintendo selling Rare to Microsoft was really for the best. However, the celebrated developer’s fortunes do seem on the upswing following the dark days of Kinect sports or whatever. The online pirate game _Sea of Thieves_ is still sailing along. And we got a first tease for the team’s upcoming project, the mysterious and beautiful _Everwild_.

  

  

After rescuing themselves from the brink of bankruptcy, Obsidian is also doing pretty well these days. Microsoft bought them. And [_The Outer Worlds_](https://www.geek.com/games/review-the-outer-worlds-is-the-fallout-game-you-want-to-play-1808512/) is one of our favorite games of the year. Their newest game, _Grounded_, trades RPG systems for survival game mechanics. But don’t get too bored yet. In this _Pikmin_\-esque adventure you play as a group of shrunken kids fending off against giant ants and whatnot.

  

  

Dontnod isn’t an exclusive Xbox team, but the creators of _Life is Strange_ are bringing their next game, _Tell Me Why_, exclusively to Microsoft. Even more historic, this episodic adventure features the first playable trans main character in a major video game.

  

Alongside these reveals, we also got updates on upcoming Microsoft games like _Bleeding Edge_ (coming next March), _Age of Empires 4_, _Microsoft Flight Sim_, [Project xCloud](https://www.geek.com/games/xbox-project-xcloud-streaming-preview-launches-this-october-1805097/), _Wasteland 3_ (coming next May), and _Minecraft Dungeons_ (coming next April). For more on Xbox check out our reviews of [_Gears 5_](https://www.geek.com/games/review-gears-5-brings-a-fresh-perspective-to-the-franchise-1802618/) and the new [Elite Series 2 controller](https://www.geek.com/tech/geek-pick-xbox-elite-series-2-controller-lives-mas-1807413/).
