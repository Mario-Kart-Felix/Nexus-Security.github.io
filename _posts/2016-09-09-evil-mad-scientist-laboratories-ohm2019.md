[Lenore and Windell of Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories](https://www.evilmadscientist.com/) are one of the purest forms of open source that I know of. From the start of what we’ve all called “open hardware” their voices and leadership has inspired many of us to be as open, and sharing as much as we can.  
[The Evil Mad Scientist about page](https://www.evilmadscientist.com/about/) –

> Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories is the blog and R&D arm of Evil Mad Science LLC, a family owned small business in California, designing and producing “DIY and open source hardware for art, education, and world domination.”
> 
> Established in 2006, Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories strives to live up to its motto, “Making the World a Better Place, One Evil Mad Scientist at a time,” serving as a resource for budding evil mad scientists everywhere.

[Check out the product directory](https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/directory), most are open-source hardware and/or have open-source software.

They might be most known for their bots, including [The Original EggBot](https://egg-bot.com/history/), an open source CNC art robot.

However, they also made the now famous [Mooninite kit, Peggy](https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/tinykitlist/35-tinykitcat/71-peggy) ([MAKE link is broken](http://blog.makezine.com/never_forget_13107_memori/)).

[Here are a couple screenshots](https://www.flickr.com/photos/adafruit/4315379709/in/photolist-7zks3r-7zpePN/) from when our cats would video chat with each other back in 2010 and talk about hardware, we (Adafruit) were still an apartment company back then.

[Here is a great profile of Lenore and Windell on MAKE](https://makezine.com/2019/08/26/maker-business-profile-evil-mad-scientist-laboratories/) from this year (2019).

And for more retro, a photo from the second (!) Maker Faire in 2007 of Ladyada with Lenore and Windell. [Oh! They also made BristleBots](https://blog.adafruit.com/2012/01/11/before-hexbug-mad-scientists-created-bristlebot/).

![Ohm](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2019/09/ohm.jpg)

October is [open-source hardware month](https://ohm.oshwa.org/)! Every single day in October we’ll be posting up some open-source stories from the last decade (and more!) about open-source hardware, open-source software, and beyond!

Have an open-source hardware (or software) success story? A person, company, or project to celebrate? An open-source challenge? Post up here in the comments or email [opensource@adafruit.com](mailto:opensource@adafruit.com), we’ll be looking for, and using the tag [#OHM2019](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OHM2019&src=typed_query&f=live) online as well! Check out [all the events](https://ohm.oshwa.org/events/) going on here!
