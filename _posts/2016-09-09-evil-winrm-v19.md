**Evil-Winrm v1.9 - The Ultimate WinRM Shell For Hacking/Pentestin****g**

  

  

  

This shell is the ultimate WinRM shell for hacking/pentesting.

WinRM (Windows Remote Management) is the Microsoft implementation of WS-Management Protocol. A standard SOAP based protocol that allows hardware and operating systems from different vendors to interoperate. Microsoft included it in their Operating Systems in order to make life easier to system administrators.

This program can be used on any Microsoft Windows Servers with this feature enabled (usually at port 5985), of course only if you have[credentials](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Credentials "credentials")and permissions to use it. So we can say that it could be used in a[post-exploitation](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Post-Exploitation "post-exploitation")hacking/pentesting phase. The purpose of this program is to provide nice and easy-to-use features for hacking. It can be used with legitimate purposes by system administrators as well but the most of its features are focused on hacking/pentesting stuff.

**Requirements**  
Ruby 2.3 or higher is needed. Some ruby gems are needed as well:`winrm >=2.3.2`,`winrm-fs >=1.3.2`,`stringio >=0.0.2`and`colorize >=0.8.1`. Depending of your installation method (3 availables) the installation of them could be required to be done manually.  
  
**Installation & Quick Start (3 methods)**  
  
**Method 1. Installation directly as ruby gem (dependencies will be installed automatically on your system)**  

*   Step 1. Install it (it will install automatically dependencies):`gem install evil-winrm`
*   Step 2. Ready. Just launch it!`~$ evil-winrm -i 192.168.1.100 -u Administrator -p 'MySuperSecr3tPass123!' -s '/home/foo/ps1_scripts/' -e '/home/foo/exe_files/'`

  
**Method 2. Git clone and install dependencies on your system manually**  

*   Step 1. Install dependencies manually:`~$ sudo gem install winrm winrm-fs colorize stringio`
*   Step 2. Clone the repo:`git clone https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm.git`
*   Step 3. Ready. Just launch it!`~$ cd evil-winrm && ruby evil-winrm.rb -i 192.168.1.100 -u Administrator -p 'MySuperSecr3tPass123!' -s '/home/foo/ps1_scripts/' -e '/home/foo/exe_files/'`

  
**Method 3. Using bundler (dependencies will not be installed on your system, just to use evil-winrm)**  

*   Step 1. Install bundler:`gem install bundler:2.0.2`
*   Step 2. Install dependencies with bundler:`cd evil-winrm && bundle install --path vendor/bundle`
*   Step 3. Launch it with bundler:`bundle exec evil-winrm.rb -i 192.168.1.100 -u Administrator -p 'MySuperSecr3tPass123!' -s '/home/foo/ps1_scripts/' -e '/home/foo/exe_files/'`

  
**Documentation**  
  
**Clear text password**  
If you don't want to put the password in clear text, you can optionally avoid to set`-p`argument and the password will be prompted preventing to be shown.  
  
**Ipv6**  
To use IPv6, the address must be added to /etc/hosts. Just put the already set name of the host after`-i`argument instead of an IP address.  
  
**Basic commands**  

*   **upload**: local files can be auto-completed using tab key.
    *   usage:`upload local_filename`or`upload local_filename destination_filename`
*   **download**:
    *   usage:`download remote_filename`or`download remote_filename destination_filename`

**Note about paths (upload/download)**: Relative paths are not allowed to use on download/upload. Use filenames on current directory or absolute path.  

*   **services**: list all services. No administrator permissions needed.
*   **menu**: load the`Invoke-Binary`,`l04d3r-LoadDll`,`Donut-Loader`and`Bypass-4MSI`functions that we will explain below. When a ps1 is loaded all its functions will be shown up.

**Load powershell scripts**  

*   To load a ps1 file you just have to type the name (auto-completion usnig tab allowed). The scripts must be in the path set at`-s`argument. Type menu again and see the loaded functions. Very large files can take a long time to be loaded.

**Advanced commands**  

*   Invoke-Binary: allows exes compiled from c# to be executed in memory. The name can be auto-completed using tab key and allows up to 3 parameters. The executables must be in the path set at`-e`argument.

*   l04d3r-LoadDll: allows loading dll libraries in memory, it is equivalent to:`[Reflection.Assembly]::Load([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("pwn.dll"))`  
    The dll file can be hosted by smb, http or locally. Once it is loaded type`menu`, then it is possible to autocomplete all functions.

*   Â Donut-Loader: allows to inject x64 payloads generated with awesome[donut](https://github.com/TheWover/donut "donut")technique. No need to encode the payload.bin, just generate and inject!

*   You can use this[donut-maker](https://github.com/Hackplayers/Salsa-tools/blob/master/Donut-Maker/donut-maker.py "donut-maker")to generate the payload.bin if you don't use Windows. This script use a python module written by Marcello Salvati ([byt3bl33d3r](https://twitter.com/byt3bl33d3r "byt3bl33d3r")). It could be installed using pip:
*   `pip3 install donut-shellcode`

*   Bypass-4MSI: patchs AMSI protection.

**Kerberos**  

*   First you have to sync date with the DC:`rdate -n`
*   To generate ticket there are many ways:  
    *   Using[ticketer.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/ticketer.py "ticketer.py")from impacket:  
        `ticketer.py -dc-ip -nthash -domain-sid -domain`
    *   If you get a kirbi ticket using[Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus "Rubeus")or[Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz "Mimikatz")you have to convert to ccache using[ticket\_converter.py](https://github.com/Zer1t0/ticket_converter "ticket_converter.py"):  
        `python ticket_converter.py ticket.kirbi ticket.ccache`
*   Add ccache ticket. There are 2 ways:  
    `export KRB5CCNAME=/foo/var/ticket.ccache`  
    `cp ticket.ccache /tmp/krb5cc_0`
*   Add realm to`/etc/krb5.conf`(for linux). Use of this format is important:  
    ```
     CONTOSO.COM = {  
                 kdc = fooserver.contoso.con  
     }
    ```
*   Check Kerberos tickets with`klist`
*   To remove ticket use:`kdestroy`
*   For more information about Kerberos check this[cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/TarlogicSecurity/2f221924fef8c14a1d8e29f3cb5c5c4a "cheatsheet")

  
**Extra features**  

*   To disable colors just modify on code this variable`$colors_enabled`. Set it to false:`$colors_enabled = false`
