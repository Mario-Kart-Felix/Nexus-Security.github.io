In this [CNC Kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiczXOhGpvoQGhOL16EZiTg) video, Stefan explores the idea of gradient infills for 3D prints. As he points out, the internal stresses on a structure are not uniform. So, he decided to experiment with adding more internal structure where it is needed and less where it is not. As someone in the video comments points out, this is how organic bone is structured.

As always with Stefan’s videos, he hopes his experiments widen the conversation about 3D print design possibilities and will inspire others to explore further. He wrote up a more detailed [piece](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcnckitchen.com%2Fblog%2Fgradient-infill-for-3d-prints) about his experiments on his website and has posted to GitHub [the Python script](https://github.com/CNCKitchen/GradientInfill) that he wrote for post-processing existing G-Code to add gradient infill to prints.
