In this episode of [CNC Kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiczXOhGpvoQGhOL16EZiTg), Stefan does some experimenting with Colorfabb Light-Weight PLA filament.

LW-PLA is a type of PLA filament that creates microscopic bubbles in the material during the printing process. This can lower the density of your prints by almost 60%. Stefan tests for printability and strength of the LW-PLA at different degrees of foaming to determine which applications this material might be useful for.
