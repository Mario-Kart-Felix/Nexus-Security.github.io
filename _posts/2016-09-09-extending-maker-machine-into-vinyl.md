[Daniel Eichhorn posts on squix.org](https://blog.squix.org/2020/02/extending-the-multi-maker-machine.html) about hacking a desktop 3018 CNC mill into a vinyl cutter.

> A while back I got a cheap Chinese 3018 CNC desktop mill. It can mill wood, acrylic and many other softer materials. Some people even used it to engrave aluminum.
> 
> You can buy these devices in many different versions and sizes. They are usually built with 2020 and 2040 extrusion elements and 3D printed parts. 3 stepper motors control the position of the tool. Mine is called 3018 in reference to the size of the build table: 30x18cm.
> 
> A spindle motor rotates the tool bit to engrave or cut away from the base material. With many of these CNC machines, you can replace the spindle motor with a (weak) laser module for engraving or cutting. I extended mine with a 2.5W laser and it is strong enough to cut cardboard or even thin balsa wood.

But Daniel  wanted to turn the desktop CNC mill into a vinyl cutter. Vinyl cutters may be used to create stickers. Or create T-Shirt patterns with heat transfer vinyl.

> It turns out with the right tools it’s really easy. All you need is a drag knife and a 3d printed converter.
> 
> You can make the drag knife from a razor blade. Or you can buy a replacement part intended for a professional vinyl cutter. I believe it’s worth to spend $10 on this part rather than making it yourself. This will have a big impact on the quality of your cuts.

See how this was accomplished in the [blog post here](https://blog.squix.org/2020/02/extending-the-multi-maker-machine.html).
