Version 20.1, 19,10, 19.3, 19.1.3, 19.1, 18.10, 18.8-2 (eight versions - Build 200101, 191023, 190508, 190307, 190104, 181228, 180901, 180819 and 161203) of ExTiX 64 bit are based on Ubuntu. In ExTiX I have installed Deepin Desktop 15.11, Budgie 10.4, LXQt 0.14.1 respectively KDE 4.17 together with Kodi 18.  
  
PROGRAM content etc  
Among many other programs GParted, Brasero, SMPlayer, Gimp and Kodi. In addition Java and all necessary additions in order to install programs from source.  

  

NEW FUNCTIONS etc

1.You can run ExTiX from RAM. Use boot alternative 3 (load to RAM) or Advanced. A wonderful way to run Linux if you have enough RAM. Everything will be super fast. When ExTiX has booted up you can remove the DVD or USB stick.

2\. You will have the opportunity to choose language before you enter the Deepin 15.11 Desktop. All main languages are supported.

3\. I have replaced Deepin Installer with the Reborn version of Deepin Installer. Works better in every way.

4\. I have replaced kernel 5.3.0-rc6-exton with kernel 5.5.0-rc3-exton.

5\. Spotify and Skype are pre-installed.

6\. You can watch Netflix while running Firefox.

7\. You can install ExTiX Deepin also in VirtualBox/VMware using Deepin Installer. (In previous versions you had to “chroot” into the install partition and install Grub).

8\. While installing ExTiX Deepin to a USB stick using Rufus 3.8 you can create a persistent partition on the stick.
