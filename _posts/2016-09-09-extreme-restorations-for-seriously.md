Because I watch so many restoration videos, _YouTube’s_ algorithms keep feeding me more while the level of challenge to the restorations seems to keep getting more extreme. Some of these tools, pulled out of the dump, found in the corners of abandoned buildings, pulled out of the mud, are so grotty they’re hard to look at. But what the restorers are able to do is so dramatic, I find it strangely hopeful and uplifting.
