Some folks bring out an heirloom table runner when they have company, but what if you sewed your own and made it musical? We’d never put it away! \[kAi CHENG\] has an [Instructable about how to recreate his melodic material](https://www.instructables.com/id/Fabric-Your-Drum-Machine/), and there is a link to [his website](http://www.dkaib.com/#/drummachine-x-tablerunner/), which describes his design process, not just the finished product. We have a video below showing a jam session where he exercises a basic function set.

GarageBand is his DAW of choice, which receives translated MIDI from a Lilypad. If you don’t have a Lilypad, any Arduino based on the ATmega328P chip should work seamlessly. Testing shows that conductive threads in the soft circuit results in an occasional short circuit, but copper tape makes a good conductor  at the intersections. Wide metallic strips make for tolerant landing pads beneath modular potentiometers fitted with inviting foam knobs. Each twist controls a loop in GarageBand, and there is a pressure-sensitive pad to change the soundset. Of course, since this is all over MIDI, you can customize to your heart’s content.

MIDI drums come in all shapes and sizes, from a [familiar game controller](https://hackaday.com/2015/07/18/forgotten-rock-band-drum-controller-as-a-midi-instrument/) to [hand rakes](https://hackaday.com/2011/07/29/midi-air-drums-let-you-play-anywhere/).
