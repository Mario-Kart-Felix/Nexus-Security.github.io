A Brief History of Messenger Kids
---------------------------------

In December 2017, [Facebook launched Messenger Kids](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/facebook-launches-messenger-kids-children/). This is a standalone version of Messenger designed for children aged between six and 12. The idea being to give children access to Facebook before they reach 13 and can sign up for Facebook proper.

Despite the fact that parents are in charge of setting up their children’s Messenger Kids accounts, [experts begged Facebook to dump Messenger Kids](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/experts-facebook-messenger-kids/). This was due to their belief that technology and social media can be harmful to children and teenagers.

Messenger Kids has persisted, and Facebook is now improving its parental controls.

New Messenger Kids Parental Controls
------------------------------------

Facebook announced the new Messenger Kids parental controls in a post on [About Facebook](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/02/messenger-kids-controls/). You can now see who your child is chatting with, what photos they have sent, who they have reported and blocked, and on which devices they’re using Messenger Kids.

You can also download your child’s information, in the same way you can download your own information from Facebook. This includes “a list of your child’s contacts as well as the messages, images and videos they have sent and received.”

Parents can access these new parental controls in the Messenger Kids Parent Dashboard in the Facebook app for Android and iOS. Just tap the shortcut menu in the Facebook app and scroll to the Messenger Kids icon. Then, select the name of your child.
