A lot of friends reported that facebook started removing their old posts in which they express opinions about (Israel, Palestine, Hamas, Hezbollah, etc). The reason given by facebook is that those posts go against the Community Standards. Here is an example : https://ift.tt/33N3efK (the post and comments are in arabic, you may translate them).

Iâ€™m posting this to HN to raise the issue and get your opinions on the matter, in a time social media giants took over blogs, and became nearly the main gate to share what you think with a large audience.

Please keep the discussion civil.
