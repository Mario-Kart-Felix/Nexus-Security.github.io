"Well, even Facebook is hackable but at least their security is better than Twitter.", this opening statement was posted on Facebook's official Twitter account by the hacking group OurMine.

Though the accounts have now been restored, the hacking group OurMine posted the same on Facebook's Twitter, messenger and Instagram accounts.  
  
OurMine says its hacks are to show the sheer vulnerability of cyberspace. In January, they attacked and hijacked dozens of US National Football League teams accounts.  
  
They posted the following on Facebook's Twitter page-  
  

> Hi, we are O u r M i n e,  
> Well, even Facebook is hackable but at least their security is better than twitter. 

  

>  to improve your account security  
>  Contact us: contact@o u r m In e.org

On Instagram, they posted OurMine logo whereas Facebook's own website was left alone. Twitter has confirmed that the accounts were hacked albeit via a third-party and the accounts were then locked.  
  
"As soon as we were made aware of the issue, we locked the compromised accounts and are working closely with our partners at Facebook to restore them," Twitter said in a statement.  
  
These attacks followed the same trend as they did in the attack on the teams of the National Football League.  
  
The accounts were accessed by Khoros, a third-party platform. Khoros is a marketing platform, a software that allows people to manage their social media accounts all in one space. It can be used by businesses to manage their social media communications. These platforms like Khoros, have the login details of the customers. OurMine seemed to have gained access to these accounts through this platform.  
  
OurMine is a Dubai based hacking group known for attacking accounts of corporations and high profile people. It has hacked social media accounts of quite a few influential individuals like Twitter's founder Jack Dorsey, Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai, and the corporate accounts of Netflix and ESPN. According to OurMine, their attacks are intended to show people cybersecurity vulnerabilities and advises it's victims to use its services to improve security.
