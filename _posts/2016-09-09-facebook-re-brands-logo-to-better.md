![](https://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Facebook-Company-logo-1024x609.jpg) Facebook has announced a re-brand of their company logo, 15 years after its launch. The new logo is designed specifically only for the company with clarity in mind and uses custom typography and capitalization to create visual distinction between the company and app. The re-brand will become visible across all products that the Facebook company offers, include the Facebook app, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, Workplace, Portal and Calibra. The company had noticed that when people talk about Facebook, they mean the app and not the company. To combat this, the new logo was created to provide better distinction between the company and the app. In June, the company had started introducing “from Facebook” within all their apps. Over the coming weeks, the company will begin to introduce this the new brand within their products and marketing materials, including a new company website. The logo will not be based on a single colour, but will be dynamic to represent the various products that Facebook offers. Source
