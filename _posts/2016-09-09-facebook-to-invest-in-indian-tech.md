Facebook has officially announced plans to make substantial investments in technology start-ups in India. While speaking at a startup meet called ‘Huddle Kerala 2019’ in Thiruvananthapuram on Friday, Facebook’s India vice-president and managing director, Ajit Mohan, said the company is looking to make direct investments in several up-and-coming technology start-ups in the country.  

_“We are willing to spend our time and energy to tap the massive depth of engineering talent in the country”_, said Mohan. _“A couple of months ago, we announced the first minority investment that Facebook has done anywhere in the world in a company called Meesho. What Meesho does is it relies on the existing behavior of communities in India and leverages on women entrepreneurs essentially pitching products to their friends and families”_, he said.  

He went on to add that the best thing about their model was it could bring 2,00,000 first-time female entrepreneurs online. _“It is an innovation that was coming out of India which can be exported to the rest of the world, and that model has scaled a dramatic impact in job creation. Any analysis of the economy, most of the job creation happens from small business”_, he said.  

In an [interview to Mint](https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/whatsapp-payments-now-pilot-for-1-mn-users-awaiting-approval-facebook-india-md-1569501693778.html), Mohan further claimed that the launch of WhatsApp payments would create the single biggest disruption in the financial sector in the country. _“We believe we can make a material contribution to economic growth and the agenda of job creation (through financial inclusion) … WhatsApp Payments is now a pilot for 1 million users and we are waiting for regulatory approval. We have said we will comply with payments localization here”_, he said.
