Rad project from the design firm [Resting Risk Face](https://faceidmasks.com/#about).

> After uploading your face, we use computational mapping to convert your facial features into an image printed onto the surface of N95 surgical masks without distortion.

> You can use your mask for everyday life as a barrier for airborne particle droplets.
