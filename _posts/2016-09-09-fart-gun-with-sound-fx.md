-----------------------------------------------------

> I don’t know about your family, but my family needed a fart gun. This all started when my wife told me her nephew wanted a fart gun and we learned two things. First, the awesome animated movie prop/toy didn’t appear to be available anymore. Second, the only other option appeared to be a toy that SMELLED like a fart, which IMO is NOT what makes farts fun or funny.
> 
> While this was depressing in its own way, a third wonderful thing occurred that same day. I ran across the really awesome Adafruit Audio FX Sound Board, which I will provide a link to later. This device embodied everything I needed in order to take the reigns of this dilemma and win. I immediately ordered it, a few speakers to experiment with, and started designing parts and playing with different aspects of what would later become a custom super spectacular fart gun.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!

The [Adafruit Learning System](http://learn.adafruit.com) has dozens of great tools to get you well on your way to creating incredible works of engineering, interactive art, and design with your 3D printer! If you’ve made a cool project that combines 3D printing and electronics, be sure to let us know, and we’ll [feature](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) it here!
