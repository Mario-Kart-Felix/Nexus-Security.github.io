The ninth Fast & Furious film, currently known simply as Fast & Furious 9, has finished filming, director Justin Lin has announced on Twitter. The upcoming blockbuster is due for a May 22, 2020 release, and will now move into post-production. Lin previously helmed multiple entries in the franchise, directing films three through six, before stepping away for Furious 7. In the tweet, he calls Fast & Furious 9 "by far the most ambitious film of the series."

Not much is known about the plot of the ninth film yet, as no official synopsis has been revealed. As Lin's tweet reveals, it was shot between "London, Edinburgh, Tbilisi (Georgia), Phuket & Krabi (Thailand), and Los Angeles," which is in keeping with the series' globetrotting nature. Judging by star Vin Diesel's [Instagram updates](https://www.instagram.com/p/B4dN-WTFJ-t/), the film took 20 weeks to shoot

Fast & Furious 9 will not feature [Dwayne Johnson](https://www.gamespot.com/videos/the-rock-confirms-hes-not-in-fast-and-furious-9-ga/2300-6448112/), who stepped away after [very public feuds](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/with-new-cast-drama-unfolding-the-rocks-fast-and-f/1100-6453852/) with series stars Vin Diesel and Tyrese Gibson in favor of crafting the spin-off project [Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hobbs-and-shaw-review-this-fast-and-furious-spin-o/1900-6417261/).

The Fast & Furious movies have followed an unusual naming pattern so far, refusing to stick to a specific naming convention: The Fast and the Furious, 2 Fast 2 Furious, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, Fast & Furious, Fast Five, Fast & Furious 6, Furious 7, The Fate of the Furious. With this in mind, it would be surprising if Fast & Furious 9 ended up being the film's final title.  
  
Fast & Furious 10 has already been announced for an April 2, 2021 release, and is currently in pre-production. To date, the series has made over $5 billion at the international box office. The Fate of the Furious and Furious 7 are the second and third highest grossing American films in China of all time, after Avengers: Endgame.
