[Microe.com posts](https://www.mikroe.com/blog/feather-click-shield): “We are introducing our first Feather to mikroBUS™ adapter board – the Feather click shield!”

> This adapter board allows you to quickly make prototypes by combining [more than 100 Adafruit Feather compatible baseboards](https://www.adafruit.com/category/943) with hundreds of Click boards™. This board allows you to connect Feather baseboards to Click boards™ over [Adafruit FeatherWing format](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-feather/blob/master/README.md) with ease by using two mikroBUS sockets. The Feather click shield is Adafruit’s standardized open source development platform for IoT projects.
> 
> The product comes equipped with two proprietary mikroBUS™ sockets, allowing all the Click board™ devices to be interfaced with the Feather boards with no effort at all, it just clicks!

The board includes a USB C connector for power.
