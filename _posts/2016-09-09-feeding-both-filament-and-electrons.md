We sometimes forget that 3D printers are just CNC platforms with a hotend attached, and there a whole range of alternative tool heads to use. \[Jón Schone\] has been doing exactly that, and needed a way to quickly disconnect his hotend completely from his printer, so he [3D printed his own custom D-sub connector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-izkShIDXU) for both filament and wires. (Video, embedded below.)

\[Jon\] has added a number of upgrades for his Creality CR10 3D printer, including a [quick change tool mount](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eTGU4crL_s) to allow him to also use a laser engraver and even a small spindle. When the hotend is removed there’s no way to quickly disconnect the wiring , so the print head is usually left connected and placed to one side of the printer. For a quick detach solution for both wiring and the Bowden tube, he first [modified an off-the-shelf D-sub connector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eTGU4crL_s). The connector was relatively expensive, and the tube had a tendency to pop out, which led to some failed prints.

\[Jon\] wanted to use proper Bowden tube fittings inside the connector, so he designed and printed his own D-sub connector and bought loose contacts. Pushing the contacts into the housing turned out to be quite difficult to do without breaking them, so he’s working on making that process simpler. This is just one of many examples of 3D printing 3D printer upgrades, which has been a core feature of the RepRap project right from the beginning. Check out the video after the break

We have no shortage of 3D printer hacks and there will be many more to come. Some cool recent ones includes the [Jubilee CNC](https://hackaday.com/2019/11/14/jubilee-a-toolchanging-homage-to-3d-printer-hackers-everywhere/) that was built from the start with automatic tool changing in mind, and a printer that [fits in your backpack](https://hackaday.com/2019/10/02/x-printer-fits-in-a-backpack/).
