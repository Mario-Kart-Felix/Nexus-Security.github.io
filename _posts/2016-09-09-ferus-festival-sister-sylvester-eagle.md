> The Eagle and the Tortoise is a theatrical reading experience tracing the story of a young Turkish woman who became an icon of leftist resistance as an armed militant, political prisoner, and proxy soldier in the American war against ISIS. Moving between myth, history, and journalism, The Eagle and the Tortoise shifts our perspective on this still-unfolding tragedy of our time.
> 
> The piece makes use of [National Sawdust’s](https://nationalsawdust.org/about-2-2/) Meyer Sound’s Constellation acoustic system and its immersive component Spacemap to envelop audiences in a live score improvised by both human and non-human performers. Within that immersion the audience reads an illustrated storybook by the light of their headlamps.
> 
> Lighting designer Bruce Steinberg has designed and made 100 wifi controlled headlamps to be worn by audience members using Adafruit’s Feather System. [The Feather Huzzah ESP8266 with stacking headers](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3213) provides the connectivity and control, with the [NeoPixel FeatherWing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2945) stacking on top, and the [FeatherWing Proto](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2884) providing logic below. [The LiPoly 400mAh battery](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3898) provides excellent battery life and tucks perfectly inside.
> 
> Working with the local manufacturer and 100% woman owned Adafruit has been an excellent fit with the politics of the woman led National Sawdust and Sister Sylvester.
> 
> The Eagle and the Tortoise will be opening Ferus Festival at National Sawdust, NYC, on Jan 10th. There are two performances, 7pm and 9:30pm, and [tickets are available here](https://nationalsawdust.org/sister-sylvester).
