Natalina shared this incredible project on Instructables!

> It’s been a while since I dug into a meaty project, so when Joel from Ants on a Melon asked me to make a costume piece for the launch of his new fiber optic products, I gladly accepted.

> The design constraints of this one were challenging, as it had to be one size fits all, appeal to a wide audience, and of course show off the product. After some back and forth we decided on a set of wings, which gave me an excuse to execute on a design idea I’ve had for a long time.

> I love the silhouette and drama of wings, but structural pieces have their drawbacks. I’ve damaged my fair share of wings in a cab, and had a hard time making my way through a crowd or not worn them for fear of injuring someone in a crowd. They are also generally cumbersome to pack and often stay at home because it’s not worth a whole suitcase for a single costume piece. With these pitfalls in mind I took advantage of the fibers themselves to create the winged shape while keeping the base pretty minimal, which allows for easy transport and mobility with all the impact of a large set of wings. While there are some things I would change for next time, I’m pretty happy with how they turned out!
