These wings will make you look like a techno super-hero. Shared by [Natalina](https://www.instructables.com/member/Natalina/) on [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/Fiber-Optic-Wings/):

> The design constraints of this one were challenging, as it had to be one size fits all, appeal to a wide audience, and of course show off the product. After some back and forth we decided on a set of wings, which gave me an excuse to execute on a design idea I’ve had for a long time.

> if you want to make these wings now you can check out some of the other fiber optic whips on the market, or take a stab at doing the electronics yourself. These two instructables (Jellyfish Skirt and Fiber Optic Fairy Wings) use smaller bundles, but are good inspiration for creating your own lighting source and fiber optics.
