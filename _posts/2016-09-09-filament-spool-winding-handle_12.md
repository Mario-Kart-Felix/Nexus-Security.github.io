> This winding handle can be fitted to the side of an empty filament spool which can then be used to hold filament samples. The handle makes it easier to spin the spool and wind the filament into place.
> 
> Drill a 10mm hole in the filament spool making sure that the handle, when fitted, will be inside the diameter of the spool. You may need to make the hole slightly larger to fit the spindle through – wiggle the drill a bit!

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
