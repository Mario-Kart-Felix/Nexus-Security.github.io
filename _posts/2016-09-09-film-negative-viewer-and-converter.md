Sooner or later there won’t be any negatives left to develop anymore. But right now we still live in a time when one might come across a bunch of negatives or film that needs to be developed. When that happens, most of us don’t have the tools to see what’s on those negatives, and the expensive process of printing comes into play. \[Random\_Canadian\] has created a 3D printed negative viewer and converter that looks fantastic.

More from [hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2020/02/18/film-negative-viewer-has-many-positives/):

> The Pi uses the negative image effect to turn the negatives positive, and then outputs them to the TV. If \[Random\_Canadian\] finds one worth bringing into the 21st century, he pushes the green button to take a picture with the Pi camera and save it to that awesome [cryptex USB drive](https://www.instructables.com/id/Secret-Dual-USB-Data-Vault/). When he’s tired of walking down memory lane, he pushes the red button to exit the program.
