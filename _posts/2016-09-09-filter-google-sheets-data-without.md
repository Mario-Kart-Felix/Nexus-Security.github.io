Filters in [Google Sheets](https://www.howtogeek.com/425040/the-beginners-guide-to-google-sheets/) let you analyze data in your document by showing only the things you want. However, it changes how others see the document, too. Here’s how to use filter views to leave each collaborator’s view unchanged.

Fire up [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets) and open up a spreadsheet to get started.

Click Data > Filter Views > Create New Filter View.

The row numbers and column letters will turn a dark gray color when activated. At this time, you should give your filter view a name to distinguish it from any other views you make in the future and check the range is correct. You can always edit both of these later if needed.
