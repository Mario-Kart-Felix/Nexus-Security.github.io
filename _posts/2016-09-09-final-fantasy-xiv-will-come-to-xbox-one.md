With X019 happening, plenty of big announcement have been made for Microsoft's gaming platforms, including several Japanese games making their way to Xbox. A total of [10 Final Fantasy games will hit Xbox Game Pass](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lots-of-final-fantasy-games-are-coming-to-xbox-gam/1100-6471465/), while Sega revealed [three Yakuza games will debut on the platform](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yakuza-series-coming-to-xbox-one-for-the-first-tim/1100-6471445/) as well. But what wasn't part of the stage show was Xbox boss Phil Spencer confirming that Square Enix's MMORPG, [Final Fantasy XIV](https://www.gamespot.com/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn/), will be coming to Xbox One.

In addressing the press at X019, Spencer said, "I wanted you to know, rest assured that we will be bringing that game \[Final Fantasy XIV\] to Xbox. We have a great relationship with Yoshida-san \[FFXIV director\] and we’re working through what it means to bring \[to Xbox\] a cross-platform MMO that they’ve run for years."

While it may not come as too much of a surprise, since FFXIV director/producer Naoki Yoshida has continually said he hopes to eventually bring the game to other platforms, Spencer's statement makes it clear that things are actually moving along. No potential release date or launch window was suggested, however.

In a [previous interview with Yoshida-san](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-final-fantasy-xiv-devs-poured-their-hearts-and/1100-6469975/), he told us, "My direction has never changed from the beginning when we started with A Realm Reborn: strive to have as many people play FFXIV on multiple platforms. Secondly, I want to allow people to play with their friends without any cross-platform limitations. I am still in discussion with Microsoft and Nintendo to make this a reality."

FFXIV and all three of its expansions are playable now on PC and PS4; for more on why the MMORPG is important, be sure to read our [FFXIV Shadowbringers review](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-xiv-shadowbringers-review-dancer-in-/1900-6417212/), [post-mortem interview with Yoshida-san](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-final-fantasy-xiv-devs-poured-their-hearts-and/1100-6469975/), and feature on [how the latest expansion became one of the best stories told in franchise history](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-shadowbringers-grew-to-become-the-best-ffxiv-s/1100-6470460/).
