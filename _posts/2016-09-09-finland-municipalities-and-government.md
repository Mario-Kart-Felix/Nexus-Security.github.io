**Finland is adapting to protect itself from a secret criminal organization warning to attack cyber-security if the country fails to pay Bitcoins as the ransom money. **  
  
"Around two hundred Finland government bodies and districts participated in the preparation. The situation reportedly concerns a possible group of hackers asking Bitcoin ransom before prosecuting several attacks on cybersecurity," concludes the reports of YLE. The threats are said to be given by **#Tietovuoto321**, a crew of criminal hackers. According to reports, the group sent Bitcoin ransom blackmails to more than 200 Finnish government agencies, in response to which the Finland authorities have taken steps.

**Organizations prepared for further warnings-** The training **Taisto** is conducted by the Population Register Centre, aiming for supporting the technologization of the nation and computerized assistance in Finland. The Population Register Centre works for the Ministry of Finance. As of now, public agencies and bodies noticed their websites and cybersecurity vulnerable to hacking recently. Therefore, a training program is said to be scheduled in the coming days. "The voluntary bodies have reacted happily," says General Secretary, Population Register Centre. He further says, "The institutions in recent times have started waking up to new attacks daily and it is becoming a matter of concern for the nation."  
**Cases of Ransomware threats have increased- **  
The attacks demanding ransoms have multiplied in recent times. Government bodies have become a simple target for hackers all around the world. In a new report published by Hard Fork, "The American government had to pay the hackers to recover their health institutions' data servers."In a data breach incident last month in Mexico, the hackers demanded Bitcoins valued $4.9 million from a government-owned oil company named Pemex.  
  
But it's not all sad and gloomy. In a surprising change of events recently, a user sufferer of ransomware claimed vengeance on his enemies by hacking the database that supported their virus, publishing 1000 deciphering codes for other victims to help them get their money back. In the present times, it is quite difficult to completely divert such warnings in the actual course, but the training tries to support institutions' capacities to fight an invasion.
