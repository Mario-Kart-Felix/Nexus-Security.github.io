Mozilla seems to be really concerned about Firefox users as it is continuously taking steps to provide a better experience. With the upcoming Firefox 72 that will start rolling out to users in January 2020, Firefox will reportedly hide popup notifications by default.  

The report comes from [ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/firefox-to-hide-notification-popups-by-default-starting-next-year/) according to a statement from a Mozilla engineer. Notably, Mozilla conducted an experiment on Firefox Nightly and Beta to understand user interactions with notifications from which they got to know that 97% of Firefox users dismiss notifications.  

With this change, when a website triggers a popup, it will be hidden by default and an animated icon will appear on the address bar to let the user know that a popup notification has shown up.  

**I tested out the feature in Firefox Nightly 72 build running on my laptop** and found the claims to be true. Take a look at the below video to see the new icon that animates whenever you get a new notification popup.  

  

As you can see, the new implementation had a very minimal intrusion on the workflow since the only way I will get to know that a website is trying to show me notification is by that wiggly animated icon, which is far better than straight-up shouting at the user for permissions in my opinion.  

Mozilla’s decision to hide the notification pop-up by default is indeed great for users. I personally disable notifications in browsers to avoid getting distracted when I’m looking for something. With this feature, I might actually consider keeping the notification popup feature turned on whenever I use Firefox as there is comparatively less intrusion.  

So, what are your thoughts on this new pop-up implementation of Firefox? Tell us in the comments.
