> I’ve always wanted to be a fish biologist, while the only art I would do growing up was the occasional fish doodle. I got into the art because when I moved for grad school my walls were empty and boring. To change that, I went to an art gallery and found out that art was expensive. I couldn’t afford enough to decorate my walls as a grad student. However, some of the research techniques that I use produced very colorful, pretty images, so I decided to print them out and hang them on my walls. Friends saw the prints on my walls and wanted to by some for themselves and said I should put them up in galleries. So I did and that’s how I became an artist.
