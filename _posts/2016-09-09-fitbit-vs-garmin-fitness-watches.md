Fitbit and Garmin are the two biggest names in the fitness tracker industry. That said, it’s sometimes hard to distinguish the differences between each company’s trackers. Both have a solid lineup of devices that serve specific purposes at varying price points.

If you’re looking for a Fitbit and Garmin watch comparison, you’re in the right place. We’ll provide you with a crucial overview of the Fitbit vs. Garmin debate that can solve all of your shopping woes.

Fitbit vs. Garmin: Budget Fitness Trackers

Budget fitness trackers are typically the most basic of the trackers, but that doesn’t mean they’re not as helpful as pricier models. Fitness trackers on the cheaper side are under $100 and have only the most essential features to keep you aware of your activity level. These sleek, affordable fitness trackers will still get the job done.
