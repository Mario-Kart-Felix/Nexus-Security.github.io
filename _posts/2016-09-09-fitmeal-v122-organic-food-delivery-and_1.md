A HAH! A CLUE!
--------------

[![CLUE](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2019/12/123119cluelogo.png)](https://youtu.be/uNDqkglM8_Y)

[![CLUE](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2019/12/123119clueprotos.jpg)](https://youtu.be/uNDqkglM8_Y)

[![CLUE](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2019/12/123119clue.gif)](https://youtu.be/uNDqkglM8_Y)

Coming soon, our latest CircuitPython powered board, CLUE! Here’s a bit more, and the TOP SECRET video – [YouTube](https://youtu.be/uNDqkglM8_Y):

> _“We wanted to build some projects that have a small screen and a lot of sensors. This board has a 1.3″ 240×240 IPS TFT display, two buttons, and a ton of sensors: LSM series 9 DOF motion, APDS9960 light/color/proximity, PDM microphone, humidity, temperature and barometric environmental sensing. There’s a QWIIC/STEMMA QT connector for adding more sensors like PM2.5 air quality and others that were too big to fit on the board. We’ll be primarily using CircuitPython for programming it, but it will also work in Arduino. And of course, we’d love to see MakeCode on it! After designing it, the board was close enough to micro:bit-shape-size that we moved a few parts to make it fit in micro:bit robots and some projects – the nRF52840_ _chip_ _is a big upgrade and it can do stuff like Tensorflow lite for microcontrollers, BLE central and peripheral, and more.”_

[Hackster.io has some coverage](https://www.hackster.io/news/get-a-clue-about-the-world-with-adafruit-s-new-board-the-clue-7901884a7a28) as well.

[![LEGO](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2019/12/123119lego.jpg)](https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/mindstorms-ev3/python-for-ev3)

Follow up, looks like this is now live – [Python for EV3](https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/mindstorms-ev3/python-for-ev3):

> _“You can now use your EV3 Brick to unleash the power of Python programming using MicroPython. Simply install the EV3 MicroPython image onto any micro SD card and boot up your EV3 Brick from it to start programming straight away. Switching back to the standard LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 firmware is just as simple. We have also provided full documentation and sample API code to get you started.”_
