_Mario Kart Tour_, released [earlier this week for Android and iOS](https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/09/25/mario-kart-tour-android-release/), is…bad. Not only is it a pretty poor representation of the console game, it’s packed full of the worst kind of mobile microtransactions—including a monthly subscription.

To be honest, it’s hard to find a mobile racing game that doesn’t feature this kind of BS. But we’ve found a few diamonds in the rough: solid, fun racers that won’t demand you pay through the nose for the privilege of playing a new level without waiting six hours. Check them out below.

Horizon Chase
-------------

This stylish single-player racer is inspired by the simplistic arcade driving games of the 80s. While it’s a basic setup, the execution is incredibly smooth, with sharp graphics and tight controls even in touchscreen-only mode. The game’s cars are recognizable even if they’re not official (I can’t believe it’s not Bugatti!), and dozens of different tracks across various environmental zones keep things fresh.

While _Horizon Chase_ doesn’t support multiplayer (you’ll need [the expanded console version](https://www.horizonchaseturbo.com/) for that), it’s a wonderful distillation of the essential elements of the genre. All you need to worry about are your lines, passing, and the most strategic locations to use nitro. If you’re looking for something more technical, _Horizon Chase_ also supports external controls. It’s free to try, and just $3 to upgrade to the full version and unlock all cars and tracks.

Crazy Taxi Classic
------------------

The original _Crazy Taxi_ hit the arcades in 1999, becoming an instant classic with its fresh, bite-sized sessions of insane city driving. It’s been often imitated (including SEGA’s ill-advised mobile remakes), but the first release is still the best way to experience the frantic and surprisingly skillful driving game. It’s available as “_Crazy Taxi Classic_” on both Android and iOS, a free download with a $2 in-app purchase to get rid of the ads.

Newbies will think that _Crazy Taxi_ is limited to vehicular chaos on crowded San Francisco streets, and that’s certainly the initial appeal, perfectly paired with 90s punk music and snarky drivers. But spend a little time on the maps—especially with an external controller or output to a TV—and you’ll find there’s surprising subtlety in weaving through traffic and setting up a run for the best customers. It’s something no true racing fan should skip, if only for their gaming education.
