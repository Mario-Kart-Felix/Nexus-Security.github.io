[Black Friday 2019](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-friday-2019-leaked-ads-best-deals-store-hour/1100-6470200/) is right around the corner, and with it comes quite a few [deals on Xbox One X bundles](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-friday-2019-xbox-one-deals-best-console-and-/1100-6471153/). However, online retailer Woot has one of its own, and it's available right now. For $310 USD, Woot is offering a "factory-reconditioned" Xbox One X with a standard-edition copy of [Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order](https://www.gamespot.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/), one day before Jedi Fallen Order's release. The same bundle goes for $500 at full price. Please note that Woot only ships to the United States.

A Woot representative told GameSpot that a factory-reconditioned item is returned, inspected, and restored to working condition by the original manufacturer or a certified partner. Each factory-reconditioned item comes with the assigned manufacturer warranty or Woot's own 90-day guarantee. If you'd prefer to have a brand-new console, this deal may not be for you, but if you're just looking to pick up an Xbox One X without breaking the bank (knowing that the [next-generation Xbox console](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-scarlett-specs-release-date-next-gen-xbox-tec/1100-6466640/) is coming next year), you probably won't find the console much cheaper than this, especially when paired with a brand-new AAA game.

Here's the catch: This flash deal will only be available for a short time. The bundle went on sale at midnight ET on November 14, and the deal will run for 24 hours or while supplies last.

If you're holding out for a new console and can wait until Black Friday, you'll be able to get the Xbox One X bundle with Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order (Deluxe Edition) for $350 from multiple retailers. [Best Buy's Black Friday sale](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-friday-2019-at-best-buy-the-best-gaming-tech/1100-6471254/) includes the bundle with three months of Xbox Live Gold for that same price. That said, we expect the Black Friday offer will sell out fast, so be sure to snag that bundle quickly if you've got your eye on it.

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order releases November 15 for Xbox One, PS4, and PC. It's developed by [Apex Legends](https://www.gamespot.com/apex-legends/) developer Respawn Entertainment and takes many cues from the Dark Souls series. We wrote about its thoughtful combat and Metroidvania inspirations in our [Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order preview](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-doesnt-break-the-mold-/1100-6470625/).
