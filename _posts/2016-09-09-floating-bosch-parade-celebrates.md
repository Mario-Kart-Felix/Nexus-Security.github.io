If you’re going to live in apocalyptic times, you might as well turn it into a parade. That’s just what folks in the city of [Hertogenbosch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27s-Hertogenbosch) in the Netherlands. It’s also a floating parade, which can really up the whimsy factor when you’re talking about recreating images from one of the greatest visionaries for apocalyptic imagery in the history of painting. Here’s more from [COLOSSAL](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2020/02/bosch-parade-netherlands/):

> A floating parade dedicated to painter [Hieronymus Bosch](https://boschparade.nl/en/bosch-parade/) ([previously](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/?s=Hieronymus+Bosch)) honors the artist’s fascination with the fantastical and absurd in an annual event that embodies his philosophy and aesthetic. The 2019 occurrence of [the Bosch Parade](https://boschparade.nl/en/bosch-parade/) included a musical performance played on a partially submerged piano and a scene with two people straddling enormous horns, just two of fourteen vignettes devoted to an evolving story about “power and counterforce, battle and rapprochement, chaos and hope.”

> Bosch is known for his symbolic paintings often tying in gruesome representations of the afterlife and human desire and fear. He is also regarded as one of the earliest genre painters, depicting common people and their everyday experiences. The annual Bosch Parade is described by organizers as “a theatrical and musical art spectacle on water,” drawing thousands of visitors to the southern city of [‘s-Hertogenbosch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27s-Hertogenbosch) in the Netherlands, where Bosch was born and eventually got his name from.
