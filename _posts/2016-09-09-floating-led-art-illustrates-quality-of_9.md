> You don’t have to check a website to find out whether or not New York City’s water is healthy — for the next few months, you just have to take a look at some art in the water itself. Playlab, Family New York and Floating Point have [debuted](https://pluspool.org/programming/details/light-installation/) a floating art installation, + POOL Light, that displays the water quality in NYC’s East River using LED lights. The 50×50 feet sculpture glows blue if all is well, but it turns teal if a sensor detects pathogens and pink when those levels venture beyond safe swimming standards. The brightness, frequency and sharpness of the lights respectively indicate the oxygen, turbidity (the cloudiness based on particulates) and pH levels, while the light animation changes to reflect the current’s direction.

> It’s a commentary on the environment, but a “positive” one. The creators see it as a marker of the progress made in boosting water quality since 1972’s Clean Water Act. It’s also a reminder that water is a shared resource, and indirectly a criticism of those who would seek to [undo water quality regulations](https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/03/trumps-epa-budget-proposal-cuts-funding-for-climate-change/).
