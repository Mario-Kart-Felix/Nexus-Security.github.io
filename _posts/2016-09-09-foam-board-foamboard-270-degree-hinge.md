> A hinge that will swivel 270 degrees for a foam board enclosure. Use a piece of 1.75mm filament for the hinge pin (although im sure something like a paperclip etc will work). Made for 3/16″ foam board. Opening is 4.75mm and fits snugly. Changing the orientation to print vertically seemed to work best and only the larger part of the hinge will need supports.
> 
> To finish I removed supports and cleaned it up a bit with a hobby knife. Mounted to the foam board with hot glue. When gluing be careful not to let it build or on the open center. If so the hinge will not want to move.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
