Spotify has released a revamped ‘Spotify for Artists’ app that comes with a number of new features, including a refreshed design, a new Home tab with access to various resources and expanded real-time stats for new releases. The update has been rolled out on both Android and iOS, and users verified with ‘Spotify for Artists’ can download the new version from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1222021797?mt=8) and the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spotify.s4a&referrer=adjust_reftag%3DcVPZlx1Vtyhfe%26utm_source%3Ds4a_blog%26utm_campaign%3Ds4a_mobile_home_launch_201909).  

As briefly alluded to earlier, the most notable addition is a new feature that informs creators in real time how many people are streaming their music or podcasts simultaneously at any given point in time. The company also claims that the app will make it easy for creators to better know their fans and their listening habits – _“who they are, where they’re coming from, and similar artists they’re jamming out to”_.

The Home tab will now also provide recommendations for articles and videos to help artists get the most out of the platform by making it easier to decipher info from all the raw data jostling for attention. _“From understanding how to read your data and watching presentations from our Co.Lab events, to learning about product updates and getting the Best Advice from some of the world’s most successful artists, it can all be found in the app”_, said the company.  

Finally, the app is also making it easy to switch between artist profiles, making it easier to manage a roster a artists for agents and producers who often work with multiple artists at a time.
