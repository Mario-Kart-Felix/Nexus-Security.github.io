> The simple blaster from my favourite sci-fi film Forbidden Planet.  
> All parts printed in the orientation the STL is in, the main body will need supports for the ring at the front other than that all other parts print without supports. The trigger switch is a momentary push to make button with a 7mm thread, these are very common on ebay, the torch was from Amazon for around £6. All parts simply glue together, the ring is glued into either the rear cap or the back of the body and is a snug fit to hold the back on with friction.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
