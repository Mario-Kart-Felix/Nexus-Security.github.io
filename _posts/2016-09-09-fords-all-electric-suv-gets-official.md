Ford's all-electric Mustang-inspired SUV won't be revealed to the public until November 17th, so, naturally, the slow drip-drip of information has begun. The company finally announced the vehicle's official name — the Mustang Mach-E — and you'll be able to reserve one for yourself starting this Sunday.

For a while, Ford was using the codename "Mach 1" to refer to the electric SUV. "Mach E" was also a name that was rumored to be under consideration. Now, we have the official name, making it clear that the Blue Oval isn't big on surprises or misdirection.

[The big debut](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20930394/ford-mustang-electric-suv-mach-e-reveal-date), hosted by actor Idris Elba, will help kick off the annual Los Angeles Auto Show starting next week. As soon as the event is over at approximately 6:30PM PT / 9:30PM ET, reservations will open at [Ford.com](http://Ford.com). Customers will have to drop $500 to reserve the Mustang Mach-E, though the deposits are refundable. A "limited first edition" version of the vehicle will also be available to the first customers.

The new vehicle, which is expected to have around 300 miles of range, has been [spotted a number of times](https://www.motor1.com/news/366388/ford-mustang-electric-suv-spied/) in recent months in testing camouflage. There's been [speculation](https://www.thedetroitbureau.com/2019/10/key-details-about-fords-mustang-inspired-suv-leak-out/) that it will cost around $50,000, come in short- and long-range variants, and be available in rear or all-wheel drive configurations.

The Mustang Mach-E represents the tip of the spear of Ford's ambitious $11 billion push to electrify its entire lineup. Ford has said it would introduce up to 40 all-electric and hybrid vehicles by 2022 (across all of Ford's global markets). The company has already teasing [an all-electric F-150 truck](https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20706515/ford-electric-f150-pickup-truck-pull-million-pound-train) that is expected to follow the SUV into the market.

But the company is already looking beyond these initial EVs. Ford said last April that it will [build an electric SUV using tech from EV startup Rivian](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18514031/ford-electric-pickup-truck-ev-startup-rivian-tech) as part of a $500 million investment. Ford is also [partnering with Volkswagen,](https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20690722/ford-vw-alliance-self-driving-argo-investment-valuation) and it will build at least one electric vehicle using Volkswagen's modular EV platform.
