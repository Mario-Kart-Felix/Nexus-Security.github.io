We’re fans of Lady Gaga, Super Bowls ads, and all that, however – this is a good next chapter for Intel. A CMO at a company like Intel can be a global change maker, bring clarity to strategies, and work on good causes, that just also happen to be good businesses too…

Over the past few years Intel has been steered in the wrong direction over and over for some markets, and led down some dead ends with partnerships. Back in 2017, Intel wasted time and buckets of money on [expensive partnerships](https://blog.adafruit.com/2017/07/26/intel-the-maker-community-intel-make/) that went nowhere. Eventually all the “maker” products were [canned by Intel](https://blog.adafruit.com/2017/06/19/intel-discontinues-joule-galileo-and-edison-product-lines-hackaday-intel-makerbusiness/).

We’ve tried to work through and around the various groups to get a hold of some decision makers for:

*   Coding for underrepresented groups
*   Educational efforts for youth groups for coding and electronics
*   “Buy one / give one” efforts for technology to various groups
*   Empowering girls and women through technology skill education
*   IoT sensors for climate / AgTech with groups like 4-H…

With a new CMO, we’ll try again and see how it goes.

There’s a lot that Intel can do that is both in the good business and good cause categories all at the same time, we’ll send over ideas and actionable things and see what happens.
