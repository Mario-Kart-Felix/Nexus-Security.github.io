Week 6 of [Fortnite](https://www.gamespot.com/fortnite/) Chapter 2 has arrived, which means there's another set of challenges to complete in the hit battle royale game. This week's batch is called Hide and Seek, and as usual, clearing eight of the tasks will unlock a special loading screen that features a hidden letter you'll need to find for a later challenge. This time, you're asked to **search the hidden I**. If you're not sure where it is, we've put together the map and guide below to help you out.

Where Is The Hidden I Location?
-------------------------------

As previously mentioned, the location of the letter I is hidden in the Hide and Seek loading screen that you'll unlock after completing eight of this week's challenges. The screen depicts a pair of characters hiding out inside a barn, with the I tucked away on a raised walkway near an open window.

The barn is the big giveaway, as it confirms the I is hidden at Frenzy Farm, one of the new named locations on Fortnite Chapter 2's map. Since it's such a prominent area, you can find Frenzy Farm easily just by looking at a map, but if you need a bit more direction, we've marked the barn's location below.

How To Complete The Challenge
-----------------------------

Now that you know the letter I is hidden at Frenzy Farm, make your way to the area and find the barn depicted in the Hide and Seek loading screen--it's located in the northern part of the area. Head inside and make your way up to the third floor--the I will appear near the open window, just as in the loading screen. Interact with the letter when prompted to collect it and complete the challenge.

This is the sixth hidden letter of the season thus far, with only two more remaining until you can spell out the word "FORTNITE" and unlock this season's special skin. If you need help finding any of the previous letters, you can find all of our maps and guides in our ongoing [Fortnite Chapter 2 challenges roundup](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-2-all-challenges-ego-outposts-sea/1100-6470648/).
