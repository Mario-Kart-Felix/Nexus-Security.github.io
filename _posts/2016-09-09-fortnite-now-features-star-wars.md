[Fortnite](https://www.gamespot.com/fortnite/) now has Star Wars Imperial Stormtrooper skins, just in time for the release of [Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order](https://www.gamespot.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/). You can deck yourself out in the classic suit, first seen in 1977's Star Wars: A New Hope, by grabbing the skin from the in-game store for 1500 V-Bucks. As you can see in the trailer below, it's a pretty faithful recreation of the cinematic suit.

You'll want to hurry, as the suit is only available for a limited time--it'll disappear on November 17 at 7 PM ET, so you really don't have long to grab it. Alternatively, you can get the suit for free by buying Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order from the [Epic Games Store](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/home). Jedi Order is also available on [Steam](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-more-ea-games-coming-t/1100-6470951/), but the deal is not available there (and the deal is, unfortunately, unlikely to be altered further.)

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order released today, and received an 8/10 in [our review](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-the-friends-we-/1900-6417364/). Our critic Phil Hornshaw called the game "perhaps the strongest conception of what playing as a Jedi Knight ought to really be like." While the Stormtroopers in the original trilogy has infamously poor aim, this suit won't impede your ability to take down your enemies at all. While you're trying out your new skin you might want to give some of the new challenges a go, so be sure to check out our [Fortnite challenge guide](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-2-all-challenges-visit-landmarks-/1100-6470648/).
