Fossil has finally launched its Gen 5 smartwatch in India after officially [unveiling it last month](https://beebom.com/fossil-gen-5-smartwatch-launched/). The company describes it as a ‘best-in-class technology experience’ that runs Google’s latest Wear OS software and is powered by Qualcomm’s most powerful smartwatch chip, the Snapdragon Wear 3100. It is already available for purchase in a number of markets around the world, including the US and the UK.  

Fossil Gen 5 Specifications and Features
----------------------------------------

  

The Fossil Gen 5 runs WearOS by Google (formerly Android Wear) and comes with premium hardware. It is powered by the Snapdragon Wear 3100 processor paired with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage. Sensors include accelerometer, altimeter, ambient Light, gyroscope and heart rate, while connectivity options include Bluetooth 4.2, NFC, Wi-Fi and GPS.  

The device comes with four different battery modes, including ‘Daily’, ‘Custom’, ‘Time-only’ and ‘Extended’. The final one is said to add several days of battery life to the device while still tracking heart rate and displaying notifications. The watch is also water-resistant up to 30 meters (3ATM) and comes with a microphone and a speaker to enable users to take calls and interact with Google Assistant.  

It is available in two different dial styles, paired with three strap options each. The Carlyle HR model (on the left) is available in Smoke Stainless Steel, Black Silicone and Dark Brown Leather, while the Julianna HR variant (on the right) ships with Rose Gold Stainless Steel, Blush Leather and Stainless Steel options.
