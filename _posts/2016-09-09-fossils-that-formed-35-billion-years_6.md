> The title of Earth’s Earliest Life has been returned to the fossils in the [Pilbara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilbara_Craton) region of Australia. The Pilbara fossils had held that title since the 1980s, until researchers studying ancient rocks in Greenland found evidence of ancient life there. But [subsequent research questioned](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0610-4)the biological nature of the Greenland evidence, which put the whole issue into question again.

> Now a new study of the Pilbara fossils has identified the presence of preserved organic matter in those fossils, and handed the ‘Ancient Life’ crown back to them.
