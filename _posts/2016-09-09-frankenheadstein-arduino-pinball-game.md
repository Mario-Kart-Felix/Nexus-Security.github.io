A new game by Adafruit forum user Roadshark: Frankenheadstein. An old style arcade based on head turning clown game.

> I have developed a game based on the carnival game of the dropping a ball into moving clown heads except I have used Frankensteinâ€™s monster heads. Some of the figures are turning in the game using micro servos.

The project uses an [Adafruit Audio FX sound board with onboard amplifier](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2217) for effects. An arduino mega drives all the various items due to the complexity but all the other parts were purchased from [Adafruit.com](https://www.adafruit.com/). The code is written in the Arduino IDE.

See the [video](https://youtu.be/mqX16Zg6FZ8) above and the [Adafruit Forums](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=157667&start=75) where support helped Roadshark through some of the complexity. Great work!
