> Capturing the sheer power of a massive orchestra with the signature acoustics of Synchron Stage Vienna’s Stage A was one of the most riveting sampling experiences we’ve ever had. We’re so happy with the results that we want to share them with you – as a“thank you” to our worldwide community of music creators, and as a “welcome” to new users.
> 
> The instrument offers super-quick large orchestrations with multiple microphone positions for stereo and surround output.
