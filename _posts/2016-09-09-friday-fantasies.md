**Bucerius IP Lecture Series**  
On 25 February 2020 at 7:00 pm, Bucerius Law School in Hamburg will host a lecture delivered by The IPKat's own Eleonora Rosati, on the topic of 'Brexit through the Lens of UK Copyright'. Here's the abstract:  

> On 31 January 2020, the United Kingdom formally left the European Union, though Brexit will not display its real effects until IP Completion Day, that is 31 December 2020. As things currently stand, after that date and among other things, UK courts will in principle no longer be bound by decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), nor will they be able to refer new cases to the CJEU. This apparent freedom might translate in a different approach of UK legislature and courts to key IP issues. By using UK copyright as a case study, this talk will consider to what extent this is however likely to be the case, especially in the absence of a major overhaul of the relevant statute.
