**12th Annual ISHTIP Workshop: 'Landmarks of Intellectual Property'**

  

The International Society for the History and Theory of Intellectual Property will host its 12th annual workshop from **13th to 17th July 2020** in the second largest natural harbour in the world: Poole, UK—home to Bournemouth University. 

  

The 2020 workshop will explore the contemporary relevance of landmark developments of intellectual property. Proposals are invited to consider the different ways in which a place, a time, a personality, a case, or a particular year has become a landmark in IP. 

  

Proposers should be aware that authors (except for doctoral students, who will present in a separate dedicated session) do not present their own work at ISHTIP workshops. Rather, a discussant presents a brief summary and critique of the contribution to facilitate a more general discussion. To accommodate this, final contributions must be submitted ahead of the workshop. 

  

The doctoral-student panel will be dedicated to the work of Prof Martha Woodmansee who founded ISHTIP in 2008, and who will be retiring. She has published widely at the intersection of aesthetics, cultural history, and copyright law; proposals are particularly encouraged to pursue this intersection. 

  

Proposals for contributions (please see the submission form for details) should be sent by email to Claudy Op den Kamp at copdenkamp@bournemouth.ac.uk. 

  

*   **Date for submission of proposals: Friday 17 January 2020 **
*   **Expected date for notification of acceptance: Friday 7 February 2020 **
*   **Date for submission of final contributions: Monday 1 June 2020 **
