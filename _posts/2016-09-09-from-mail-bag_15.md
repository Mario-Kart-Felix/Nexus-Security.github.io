[From the mail bag!](https://www.adafruit.com/blog/?s=mail+bag)

> Dear Lady Ada, et al.,
> 
> I have been purchasing fun products from your company for a few months now,  
> and I have to say you have completely spoiled me! Now ordering from anyone  
> else feels like torture.
> 
> …
> 
> It is not just that your orders get to me faster, what I love about ordering  
> from Adafruit is that you make me FEEL like my specific order is important,  
> and that you are working at light-speed to help me to enjoy my  
> impulse-purchase as soon as is humanly possible. I hope you take pride in  
> the way your company operates, because it is extraordinary.
> 
> Long story short, you should start carrying translucent breadboards.
> 
> Please stay as awesome as you are
