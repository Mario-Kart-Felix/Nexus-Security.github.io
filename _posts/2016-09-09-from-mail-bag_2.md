[From the mail bag!](https://www.adafruit.com/blog/?s=mail+bag)

> I have a son and 3 daughters. My son is about to be 10 and we’ve done a few kits together (a couple from your site and a couple more based on the Amazing tutorials you folks write). Thank you for the level of education you sneak in beside the “Wow! This is aweosme!”.
> 
> More importantly, I wanted to directly thank Ms. Fried. My eldest daughter is 7, and she loves math. I have recently shown her this site and several videos from it to show her that girls who like math and science can stick to it and do amazing things.
> 
> Thank you for being a role model to a little girl in Canada that her dad can be ok with. Hopefully she learns to solder well faster than her brother did.
