> My Circuit Playground Express just arrived, and I have  
> to say it’s your best product to date. I’ve been using the Circuit  
> Playground (classic – so last year) in my class at Art Center College of  
> Design in Pasadena, and it’s worked great as a self-contained learning  
> tool.
> 
> The Circuit Playground Express is a big leap forward by adding support for  
> MakeCode Visual Programming and Circuit Python. The ability to drag and drop  
> programs doesn’t sound revolutionary but it really helps keep the focus on  
> design, prototyping, and art. That is after all the overall goal, design and  
> make cool stuff.

> Thanks and keep up the excellent work.
