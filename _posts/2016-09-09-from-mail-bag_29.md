[From the mail bag!](https://www.adafruit.com/blog/?s=mail+bag)

> Just received my first order from the Adafruit website.  
> Shipping was extremely fast to the other side of the United States. I picked  
> up some heat-shrink tubing a couple of Adafruit designed breakouts and some  
> stickers to put on the back of my laptop. I was amazed at the size of the  
> breakouts (as small as a dime) and the extremely high quality of the items.  
> This is going to work great for my projects. The icing on the cake is the  
> great documentation and examples that I can find on the adafruit website. I  
> will definitely be ordering some more things for my future projects. Because  
> of the tutorials and shared libraries, Iâ€™ve been able to get my projects up  
> and running with in minutes. The examples just help spawn more ideas for  
> more projects ![ðŸ™‚](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png)
