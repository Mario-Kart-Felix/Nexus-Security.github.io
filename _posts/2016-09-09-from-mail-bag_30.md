> Hi, my name is Cameron and I just want to say you guys  
> have totally gotten me out of somewhat of a rut I’ve been in for the past  
> couple years. Your website, your videos (especially your how-to’s and  
> educational ones) have really lifted me up and gotten me back into a  
> creative mindset. I’m learning again, I’m reading and experimenting again,  
> and most importantly I feel like my self again. I’ve set up a pretty sweet  
> “maker shop” in my office complete with some Adafruit parts and tools, and a  
> 3D printer. I think this is a very scary and unsure time for a lot of people  
> like me, and what you guys do at Adafruit is truly inspiring. I love that  
> you actively and openly support of women in engineering/science/math/etc and  
> the LGBTQ+ community. Sometimes I feel like some companies kind of  
> marginalize us or forget about our group, but Adafruit doesn’t!
> 
> Anyway, thanks so much for snapping me back to myself, getting me active and  
> thinking and making again! Thank you for your support of ALL men, women, and  
> children who have a shared love of technology and engineering. Maybe I’ll  
> see you on a live stream one day!

> Sincerely
