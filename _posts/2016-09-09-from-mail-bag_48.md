> Thank you for your fast service. Your website is “geek  
> oriented” in that it is accurate and informative. I had an issue with  
> powering my RPi3 — lightning bolt on screen during boot and operations. A  
> quick interWebs search pointed me to the issue (under power) and your  
> website specifically pointed out which part (1995) I needed. I ordered what  
> I needed and some other stuff on the 20th and it all arrived on the 21st.  
> Lightning bolt gone. Bought second one for RPi2 which is serving as a NAS  
> and print server. Thanks. Keep up the good work.
