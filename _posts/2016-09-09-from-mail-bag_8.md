> Hey adafruit staff! I just wanted to write this email  
> because, I have used many different “electronics” websites and I absolutely  
> love and adore the simplistic yet technical layout of adafruit.com, I just  
> recently got out my electronics kit, and needed a guide to solder up some  
> parts and start programming a 4-digit 16-seg alphanum display, and I found  
> it quickly and easily followed it. I even added a few things to my wishlist  
> for my next project. Love you guys, stick around and I’ll always come back!
