**FudgeC2 - A Collaborative C2 Framework For Purple-Teaming Written In Python3, Powershell And .NET**

  

**Setup**  
  
**Installation**  
To quickly install & run FudgeC2 on a [Linux](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Linux "Linux") host run the following:  
```
git clone [https://github.com/Ziconius/FudgeC2](https://github.com/Ziconius/FudgeC2)  
cd FudgeC2/FudgeC2  
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt  
sudo python3 Controller.py
```For those who wish to use FudgeC2 via Docker, a template Dockerfile exists within the repo as well.  
  
**Settings:**  
FudgeC2' default server configurations can be found in the settings file:  
`/FudgeC2/Storage/settings.py`  
These settings include FudgeC2 server application port, SSL configuration, and database name. For further details see the Server Configuration section.  
N.b. Depending on your network design/RT architecture deployment, you will likely need to configure a number of proxy and routing adjustments.  
For upcoming development notes and recent changes see the [release.md file](https://github.com/Ziconius/FudgeC2/blob/master/release.md "release.md file")  
  
**First Login**  
After the initial installation you can log in with the default admin account using the credentials:  
`admin:letmein`  
You will be prompted to the change the admin password after you login for the first time.  
  
**Server Settings**

**Users**  
Users within Fudge are divided into 2 groups, admins and standard users. Admins have all of the usual functionality, such as user and campaign creation, and are required to create a new campaigns.  
Within campaign a users permissions can be configured to once of the following: None/Read/Read+Write. Without read permissions, a user will not be able to see the existence of a campaign, nor will they be able to read implant responses, or registered commands.  
User with read permission will only be able to view the commands and their output, and the campaigns logging page. This role would typically be assigned to a junior tester, or an observer.  
Users with write permissions will be able to create implant templates, and execute commands on all active implants.  
_Note: in further development this will become more granular, allow write permissions on specific implants._  
  
**User Creation**  
An admin can create a new user from within the Global Settings options. They will also have the option to configure a user with admin privileges.  
  
**Campaigns**  
  
**What is a campaign?**  
A campaign is a method of organising a engagement against a client, which allows access control to be applied on a per user basis  
Each campaign contains a unique name, implants, and logs while a user can be a member of multiple campaigns.  
  
**Implants**  
Implants are broken down into 3 areas  

*   Implant Templates
*   Stagers
*   Active Implants

  
**Implant Templates**  
An implant template is the what we will create to generate our stagers. The implant template wil contain the default configuration for an implant. Once the stager has been triggered and an active implant is running on the host this can be changed.  
The list of required configurations are:  

*   URL
*   Initial callback delay
*   Port
*   Beacon delay
*   Protocol:
    *   HTTP (default)
    *   HTTPS
    *   DNS
    *   Binary

Once a template has been created the stager options will be displayed in the Campaign Stagers page.  
  
**Stagers**  
The stagers are small scripts/macros etc which are responsible for downloaded and executing the full implant.  
Once an implant has been generated the stagers page will provide a number of basic techniques which can be used to compromise the target. The stagers which are currently available are:  

*   IEX method
*   Windows Words macro

  
**Active Implants**  
Active implants are the result of successful stager executions. When a stager connects back to the Fudge C2 server a new active implant is generated, and delivered to the target host. Each stager execution & check-in creates a new active implant entry.  
  
**_Example_**  
As part of a campaign an user creates an implant template called "Moozle Implant" which is delivery to a HR department in via word macro. This then results in five successful execution of the macro stager; as a result the user will see five active implants.  
These will be listed on the campaigns main implant page, with a six character unique blob. The unique implants will be listed something similar to below:  
```
Moozle Implant_123459  
Moozle Implant_729151  
Moozle Implant_182943  
Moozle Implant_613516  
Moozle Implant_810021
```Each of these implants can be individually interacted with, or using the "ALL" keyword to register a command against all active implants.  
  
**Implant communication**  
Implants will communicate back to the C2 server using whatever [protocols](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Protocols "protocols") the implant template was configured to use. If an implant is setup to use both HTTP and HTTPS, 2 listeners will be required to ensure that full commincation with the implant occurs.  
Listeners are configured globally within Fudge from the Listeners page. Setting up and modifying the state of listeners requires admin rights, as changes to stagers may impact other on-going campaigns using the same Fudge server.  
Currently the listeners page displays active listeners, but will allow admins to:  

*   Create listeners for HTTP/S, DNS, or [binary](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Binary "binary") channels on customisable ports
*   Start created listeners
*   Stop active listeners
*   Assign common names to listeners

  
**Implant configuration further info.**  
URL: An implant will be configured to call back to a given URL, or IP address.  
Beacon time: \[Default: 15 minutes\] This is the time in between the implant calling back to the C2 server. Once an implant has been deployed it is possible to dynamically set this.  
Protocols: The implant will be able to use of of the following protocols:  

*   HTTP
*   DNS
*   Binary protocol

A user can enable and disable protocols depending on the environment they believe they are working in.
