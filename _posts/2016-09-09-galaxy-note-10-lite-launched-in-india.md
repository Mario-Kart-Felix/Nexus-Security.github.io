After officially unveiling the Note 10 Lite earlier this month, Samsung has today launched the phone in India. The Note 10 Lite comes with a triple-rear camera set-up, a big screen, and the S-Pen that’s beloved by fans of the Note series of smartphones from the South Korean giant.  

The Note 10 Lite packs in a large **6.7-inch FullHD+ SuperAMOLED** display with a 32MP punch-hole selfie camera smack dab in the middle of the screen, which is great for symmetry. Along with that, the phone packs in the **Exynos 9810 chipset paired with up to 8GB RAM and 128GB storage.**  

  

For optics, the phone has a triple rear camera set-up with a **12MP f/1.7 primary camera with Dual Pixel AF and OIS, a 12MP f/2.2 ultra-wide angle lens, and a 12MP f/2.4 telephoto lens** with OIS.  

Powering all of this up is a **4,500mAh battery**, which should be decent enough for the phone. There’s also support for 25W fast charging.  

Samsung has launched the Note 10 Lite at **₹36,990** in India for the base 6GB/128GB variant and ₹38,990 for the high-end 8GB/128GB variant. The phone will be available in three colours Aura Glow, Aura Black and Aura Red. It’s available to pre-order now, and will go on sale starting January 30.
