Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Lite is rumored to arrive at CES 2020 next week, along with the much-rumored [Galaxy S10 Lite](https://beebom.com/galaxy-s10-lite-launch-imminent-support-page-live/). We have already seen a plethora of leaks for this smartphone – be it the [complete specs sheet](https://beebom.com/note-10-lite-leak-triple-rear-camera-amoled-display/) or [official renders](https://beebom.com/galaxy-note-10-lite-images-leaked/). But, mere days before the Galaxy Note 10 Lite goes official, we have got a first look at the device, thanks to a set of leaked real-life images.  

The image attached above ([via TechTalk TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjKhPcO_Xmg)) confirms that Galaxy Note 10 Lite is a go. It’s launching soon. And not only that, but it also confirms the myriad of design leaks over the past couple of months. The device will boast a fullscreen bezel-less flat display (unlike the Galaxy Note 10’s dual-curved screen) with a centered punch-hole design. It resembles the Galaxy A51 that [launched recently](https://beebom.com/samsung-galaxy-a51-galaxy-a71-launched-vietnam/) in Vietnam.  

The leaked images also give us a close look at the much-rumored massive square camera bump with three lenses and an LED flash – all aligned perfectly, one on each edge. There’s an S-pen in tow as well else it won’t really be a Galaxy Note device. And the rear panel, it looks like, won’t be glass like the flagship Note 10 and will instead be a glasstic panel like the mid-range Samsung Galaxy A-series phones.

The image above gives you a closer look at the front display panel. It not only confirms that the device is indeed the Galaxy Note 10 Lite (model number SM-N770F/DS), but is also showing off the punch-hole selfie camera in all its glory.  

As for the specifications, Galaxy Note 10 Lite is expected to feature a 6.7-inch Full-HD+ (2400x1080p) HDR AMOLED display. It will be **powered by the Exynos 9810 chipset** (same as 2018’s Galaxy Note 9) with up to 6GB RAM and 128GB storage. It runs OneUI 2.0, based on Android 10 out-of-the-box.  

In terms of cameras, Galaxy Note 10 Lite will **feature a 12MP (f/1.7) primary sensor**, along with a 12MP (f/2.4) telephoto camera with 2x zoom and a 12MP (f/2.2) wide-angle camera. The device will come equipped with a 4,500 mAh battery with 25W fast charging support.  

Recent leaks have suggested that the Galaxy Note 10 Lite will be priced at €609 (around $675, Rs. 48,000) and it’s difficult to determine why Samsung is adding a Lite variant to the flagship Note lineup this late. We are already seeing leaks for the [Galaxy S11](https://beebom.com/galaxy-s11-lineup-rumored-48mp-telephoto-cameras/) (or the [Galaxy S20](https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1211897344855363584), as it might be called) that launches in February next month with the newest Snapdragon 865 5G chipset instead of a two-year-old 10nm chipset.
