During the launch of the [Galaxy S20 series](https://beebom.com/samsung-galaxy-s20-vs-s20-plus-vs-s20-ultra-specs-comparison/) in San Francisco earlier this week, Samsung borrowed another page from Apple’s book and announced permanent price cuts for the [previous-gen Galaxy S10 flagships](https://beebom.com/galaxy-s10-plus-review/). The Galaxy S10 series now starts at $559 in the US. Since then, we had been waiting for the Korean giant to announce the price cut in India and well, it finally has.  

Samsung hasn’t published an official blog post, but the updated prices are now live on [Samsung India’s website](https://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/galaxy-s10-sm-g970/SM-G970FZKDINS/), as well as popular e-commerce stores. The company has cut prices of its Galaxy S10 series by up to Rs. 29,000 – that too permanently.  

Galaxy S10e was previously priced at Rs. 55,900 for the 6GB+128GB variant in India. It has now received a Rs. 8,000 price cut and starts at Rs. 47,900. Galaxy S10 was priced starting at Rs. 66,900 when it launched last year. It too has received price cuts up to Rs. 25,000 and now starts at Rs. 54,900 for the 8GB+128GB variant.
