Samsung is all set to unveil its [Galaxy S20-series](https://beebom.com/every-camera-sensor-galaxy-s20-devices-detailed-new-leak/) of smartphones on February 11, but a new report now claims that it will take exactly a month longer for the company to make the devices available for purchase. According to XDA’s Max Weinbach, the Galaxy S20, S20+ and S20 Ultra will likely be available from the _“first Friday of March”_ (March 6th).  

He also seemingly revealed the US pricing of what promises to be the most premium device in the lineup, the S20 Ultra, which he says will cost a cool $1,300 (around Rs. 92,000) a pop. As for the [Galaxy Buds+](https://beebom.com/galaxybuds-plus-airpods-pro/), Weinbach says that they’ll cost $149.99 (around Rs. 10,000).

Meanwhile, Samsung has also been rumored to launch its 2nd-gen folding smartphone, the Galaxy Z Flip (with a [15W charger](https://beebom.com/galaxy-z-flip-15w-charger/)), next month, and Weinbach now says that the company might do that on February 14th. According to him, it will be a premium device priced at $1,400 (around Rs. 1 lakh), and will be available exclusively with US carrier AT&T. It will also be available unlocked, he said.  

While the Galaxy S20-series devices will be the company’s next-gen flagship smartphones for 2020, the Galaxy Z Flip will come with a foldable screen, but in a different avatar as compared to the Galaxy Fold, which was [eventually released late last year](https://beebom.com/galaxy-fold-launched-india-price/) after multiple postponements [because of reliability issues](https://beebom.com/revamped-galaxy-fold-display-defect/).  

According to recent rumors, the Z Flip will have a clamshell form-factor, much like [Lenovo’s Moto Razr 2019](https://beebom.com/moto-razr-2019-with-foldable-display-launched-for-1499/), which was launched last year by the Chinese tech giant. Reports also suggest that it might be the first folding smartphone to feature a glass display instead of the plastic ones found not only on the Galaxy Fold, but also the Huawei Mate X and even the aforementioned new Razr.
