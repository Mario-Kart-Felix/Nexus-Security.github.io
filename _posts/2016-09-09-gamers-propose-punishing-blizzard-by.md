Being a global multinational sure is hard! Yesterday, World of Warcraft maker Blizzard faced [global criticism](https://boingboing.net/2019/10/08/world-of-warcraft-publisher-su.html) after it disqualified a high-stakes tournament winner over his statement of solidarity with the [Hong Kong protests](https://boingboing.net/tag/612strike) -- Blizzard depends on mainland China for a massive share of its revenue and it can't afford to offend the Chinese state.

Today, outraged games on Reddit's [/r/hearthstone forum are scheming](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/df0zx5/upset_about_blizzards_hk_ruling_heres_what_to_do/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) a plan to flood Blizzard with punishing, expensive personal information requests under the EU's expansive [General Data Privacy Regulation](https://boingboing.net/tag/gdpr) -- Blizzard depends on the EU for another massive share of its revenue and it can't afford the enormous fines it would face if it failed to comply with these requests, which take a lot of money and resource to fulfill.

Being a multinational is indeed hard, but it's cute to see global capitalism's potential downfall in the welter of jurisdictions the largest corporations seek to have a presence in so that they can maximize their profitability.
