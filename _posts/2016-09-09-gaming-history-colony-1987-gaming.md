[Davis A. Smith](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCusCHa2dpek4F_ER7PKH_AQ) documents his game The Colony from 1987 on YouTube. He writes:

> This is a video I made of the game I wrote in 1987 called “The Colony”. It won the Best Adventure Game of the Year from MacWorld magazine. It was one of the very first real time 3D FPS/adventure games ever. I discuss the game and the technology while doing a pretty complete demo.

This technology was used to build a virtual set used in making the movie “The Abyss”, as well as being the basis for developing Virtus Walkthrough.
