> There are lots of garage door monitor projects on hackster.io and other Maker sites. I wanted a project that would be _extensible_, to build on, for future IOT projects. Plus I wanted a platform that was well-documented and well-supported. Adafruitâ€™s cloud service for Makers, [adafruit.io,](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-adafruit-io) fit the requirements.
> 
> In addition, I was motivated by personal need. My nice neighbors had, once too often, called late at night to remind me the garage door was open ![ðŸ˜‰](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png)
> 
> This is largely inspired by and based on the [Adafruit IFTTT Door Detector](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-ifttt-with-adafruit-io/overview) project by Todd Treece for Adafruit, and other work [as mentioned on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/5p1p35/short_guide_on_using_adafruitio_and_ifttt_with/) , with a few code tweaks and add-ons.
