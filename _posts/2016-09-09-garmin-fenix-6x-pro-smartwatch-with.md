Garmin has expanded its wearables portfolio in India with the launch of three new smartwatches called the **Fenix 6S** (42mm), **Fenix 6** (47mm) and **Fenix 6X Pro** (51mm). Originally [announced back in August](https://beebom.com/garmin-fenix-6x-pro-launched/), all three devices come with a new ‘PacePro’ feature which keeps a runner’s pacing strategy on-track with grade-adjusted guidance as they run a course. The most remarkable device in the lineup is the 6X Pro, which comes with solar panels that can charge its battery when needed.

The 6X Pro is the most remarkable device of the lot, thanks to the aforementioned solar panels. According to Garmin, the device comes with _‘Power Glass’_, a transparent solar charging lens that can extend its battery life. Garmin claims that the device will have a battery life of 21 days on standard usage, but it can be extended by up to 3 days with its solar charging capabilities.  

The rest of the tech specs on the 6X and 6X Pro Solar remain identical, starting with the 1.4-inch (240×240) circular dial protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 6. Both versions also come with pre-installed topographic maps for over 2,000 ski resorts and 41,000 golf courses around the world. They also have a built-in ‘Power Manager’ tool for enhanced battery life.
