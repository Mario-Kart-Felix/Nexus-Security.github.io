> From the actual color scheme from the Empire State Building in NYC, to my [LEGO Empire State Building](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/new-york-city-21028) on the other side of the ocean. Every night my LEGO Empire State Builing has the same colors as it’s brother in NYC. Just because it can.
> 
> On a Raspberry Pi, [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) retrieves the current color scheme from the [website](https://www.esbnyc.com/explore/tower-lights) of the Empire State Buildings’ color scheme. Parses this data to JSON and sends it with BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) to Adafruit Feather. The Feather takes care that a [NeoPixel](https://www.adafruit.com/category/168) emits the colors to my LEGO setup.
