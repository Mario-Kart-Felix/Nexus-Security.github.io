[@techcoed on twitter](https://twitter.com/Dan_Aldred/status/1189949334445547520) found that our [adafruit.io platform](https://io.adafruit.com/) is “is so easy to use and looks amazing that” they made a _three_\-part video series about it. In the first video, you’ll learn how to navigate around Adafruit IO and create feeds. In the second video, you’ll install and use [the Adafruit IO Python library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_IO_Python) to send data from a Raspberry Pi to Adafruit IO. Lastly, you’ll create up a beautiful Adafruit IO Dashboard (for a weather station) to visually interpret the data being sent to Adafruit IO.
