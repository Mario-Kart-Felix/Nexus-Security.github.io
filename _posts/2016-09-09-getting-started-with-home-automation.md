> We are now going to start the home automation series, where we create a smart home that will allow us to control things like lights, speakers, sensors and so on using a central hub along with a voice assistant. In this post, we will learn how to install Home Assistant on the Raspberry Pi and we will also learn how to view the IP camera stream from the ESP32-CAM board camera we built several posts ago.
