A 3d printed zeotrope (or 4-mation) of ghosts and pumpkins. Shared by [Mike Rigsby](https://hackaday.io/mrigsby) on [Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/161254-zoetrope#menu-description):

> Of course the “flashing bars” don’t appear in real life. An Arduino with a motor shield is used to control a bipolar stepper motor and led light strings. The twelve inch diameter turntable rotates at about 60 rpm (one revolution per second). The turntable is divided into 20 sections and a ghost/pumpkin is placed on each section. The led’s are “flashed” every 1/20 of a second to provide the illusion of movement.
