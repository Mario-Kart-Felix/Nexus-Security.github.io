> The 10-inch-tall AirPod is a fully functional wireless speaker, according to its creator, a Minnesota high school student named Aaron Beckman. Beckman [posted a picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/drpoc0/i_made_a_large_10_tall_fully_functional_bluetooth/) of his creation earlier this month on the r/MildlyInteresting Reddit thread, where it’s since accrued more than 78,000 upvotes and 2,000 comments.
> 
> To make the AirPod speaker — which he’s dubbed the “AirPod Max” — Beckman used a 3D printer, available through his [high school’s robotics team](https://www.minutebots.org), to replicate and blow up an accurate clone of the AirPods.
