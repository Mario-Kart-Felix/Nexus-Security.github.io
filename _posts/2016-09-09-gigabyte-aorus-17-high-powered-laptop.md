The Aorus 17 is Gigabyte’s latest addition to its line of gaming laptops. Its impressive design, performance, and size make it an attractive device for more than just gamers—this laptop can even handle the most demanding software that designers, video editors, and artists require.

The Aorus 17 is packed with an Intel Core i9-9980HK processor, along with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 20 Series GPU. This killer combination makes running any game or software super smooth. The Nvidia GeForce RTX allows for ray-tracing, and even incorporates deep learning to get the clearest possible images. You can also adjust your graphics by using Aorus’ Graphics Switch, which allows you to select the best graphics settings for your situation.

The components inside the Aorus 17 aren’t the only exciting features of this laptop. With one look, you’ll notice the thin bezel surrounding the screen—its 3mm bezel is the thinnest in the world. The design of the Aorus 17 laptop is modeled after exotic cars and fighter jets, and it definitely shows.

The unique mechanical keyboard is another game-changing aspect of this laptop. Gigabyte uses Omron’s mechanical key switches that will remain intact for up to 15 million taps. Plus, each light on the keyboard spreads evenly across each key, creating a stunning and colorful look. Like most RGB keyboards, you can adjust the lighting from the Aorus control panel.

Cooling isn’t a problem with this laptop either. The Windforce Infinity Cooling System includes two 12V fans, five heat pipes, as well as 12 vents that ensure you won’t experience any overheating.

If you’re a designer, artist, or video editor, you might want a laptop that you can game _and_ work on. The Aorus 17 is the perfect all-in-one workhorse for games and software. Plus, designers will be happy to know that the display is tuned by X-Rite Pantone calibration.

Although the [Aorus 17](https://www.amazon.com/AORUS-17-YA-7US2150SH-i7-9750H-Windows/dp/B07XF2G948/) has a steep price of over $3,000, it makes for a luxurious laptop for both gamers and creators. Cheaper versions are also available, but it lowers in specs as you go down in price.
