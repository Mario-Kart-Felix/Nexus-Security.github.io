When you hear “Gigabyte” you instantly think of the brand’s amazing graphics cards and motherboards. Surprisingly, Gigabyte is now dabbling in another aspect of computer hardware: gaming monitors. The company recently unveiled its trio of gaming monitors at CES in Las Vegas.

What’s the best part about these stunning monitors? They’re budget-friendly. Here’s a quick rundown of each new monitor.

The **Gigabyte G27F** is the most budget-friendly monitor of the group, with a price of about $250. For such a cheap 27-inch FHD monitor equipped with a 1ms response time and 144Hz refresh rate, you can’t go wrong. It also has two built-in speakers, along with FreeSync and G-Sync compatibility. Plus, you can easily adjust its height using the stand.

Want a mid-range curved monitor on the cheaper side? You’ll want to check out the **Gigabyte G27QC**. This stunning, 27-inch monitor features QHD resolution and a 165Hz refresh rate. It comes with FreeSync Premium, as well as G-Sync compatibility. When it releases, its price will be set around $350.

Lastly, the **Gigabyte G32QC** is the most expensive and the most unique out of the three. At $370, it won’t make a huge dent in your wallet, and that’s pretty impressive for such a beautiful curved monitor. This monitor has just about the same specs as the G27QC, but it has a larger size of 32 inches.

What makes this monitor stand out is its KVM (Keyboard, Video, Mouse) functionality. In other words, you can plug in USB-C devices such as your smartphone, laptop, or tablet, and have that device’s display appear on your monitor. You can then fully control the device using your keyboard and mouse, while viewing it on your monitor.

Unfortunately, Gigabyte’s newest monitors aren’t for sale just yet, and are expected to release sometime this spring. They’re definitely worth the wait—you can’t get a better price for gaming monitors like these. When spring rolls around, make sure to keep an eye out for any updates!
