The [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us) started as a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed to demystify “code”, to show that anybody can learn the basics, and to broaden participation in the field of computer science. [Girls who code](https://girlswhocode.com) launched their #1000clubChallenge this week with a goal of starting 1000 new code clubs that are a safe and supportive environment of peers and role models where girls learn to see themselves as computer scientists!

> Girls Who Code Clubs are free after-school programs for 3rd-5th and 6th-12th grade girls to join our sisterhood of supportive peers and role models using computer science to change the world. Learn more below!
