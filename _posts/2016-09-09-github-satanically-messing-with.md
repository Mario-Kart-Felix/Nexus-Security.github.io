This seems to be followed by [github/markup issue 991](https://github.com/github/markup/issues/991), where on ordered sub-list, decimal numerals automatically turns into roman numerals.

As mentioned in "[A formal spec for GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://githubengineering.com/a-formal-spec-for-github-markdown/)", GitHub markdown spec [GFM: GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/) is built on top of the [CommonMark Spec](http://spec.commonmark.org/0.26).

And as [Tommi Kaikkonen](https://stackoverflow.com/users/8132914/tommi-kaikkonen) mentioned in [his answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44619303/6309), the ordered list is because of the dot following 666. See [GFM Spec section 5.2](https://github.github.com/gfm/#list-items).

As mentioned in [section 6.1](https://github.github.com/gfm/#backslash-escapes), any ASCII punctuation character may be backslash-escaped, to avoid this issue.  
That means:

```
- 666\. ha. 
```

(as explicitly shown in [ForNeVeR](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2684760/fornever)'s [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44623878/6309))

That is why that `666` number is changed to roman numerals in a GitHub `README` markdown.

However, no: it shows `dclxvi`, because the generated html code is

, which is consistent with [the GFM specs](https://github.github.com/gfm/#list-items):

> If the list item is ordered, then it is also assigned a start number, based on the ordered list marker"

(here, '`666`' is the ordered list marker)

You get an ordered list

within an un-ordered list _item_3.  :
    
    ```
     *    
         666.  ha. 
    ```
    
    GitHub CSS rules include:
    
    ```
    .markdown-body ol { padding-left: 2em; } 
    ```
    
    If you put `3em`, you would get

    instead of
