The GitHub Student Developer Pack now offers over $100k worth of tools and training to every student developer, anywhere that GitHub is available. If you’re new to the Pack, it provides verified students with GitHub Pro at no charge while they are in school, plus free access to the best developer tools and training—thanks to our partners—so they can learn by doing. 

As the Pack continues to grow and shape the next generation of developers, we continue to listen. We’re here to better understand how you’re using these tools and what’s missing that you hope to see included. Whether you’re developing your portfolio, building a new desktop app, or creating an interactive map—the goal of the Pack is to provide you with the tools you need to be successful.

This year, the value of the Pack tripled during the Fall semester by adding nineteen new partners in October plus a dozen in September to the twenty-one who joined our long-time partners for Back-to-School. Let’s highlight the partners who joined us since our [last post in August](https://github.blog/2019-08-20-the-github-student-developer-pack-is-back/).

A few words from our new partners[](https://github.blog/2019-10-30-get-over-100k-worth-of-tools-with-the-github-student-developer-pack/#a-few-words-from-our-new-partners)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We ask all of our new partners what motivated them to join the Pack. Here’s a sample of what they’ve told us:

_“__When I was a student, I actually used the GitHub Student Developer Pack myself! It allowed me to test and learn how to use tools that I wouldn’t have been able to otherwise. The Pack was a great help!”_ -Floran Pagliai, Weglot

_“The way that developers learn best is by getting their hands dirty, trying different things, and experimenting with a variety of tools. The Pack allows developers to do that and get exposure creating awesome projects outside the confines of the classroom.”_ -Naeem ul Haq, Educative

_“Not many high school and even college students would ordinarily be able to afford \[our tool.\] Letting students try it will give us valuable feedback about what up-and-coming developers are looking for.”_ -Levie Rufenacht, Wisej

_“The Pack opens new doors to students that were not accessible before. It basically gives them what’s needed to build a project from A to Z, lets them cultivate their curiosity, an essential quality for a developer, and free their creativity. Learning should know no boundaries.”_ -Julien Lehuraux, USE Together
