Easily add and control Give’s form fields using an easy-to-use interface.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Form Field Manager (FFM) allows you to add and manage additional fields for your Give donation forms using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Form fields include simple fields such as checkboxes, dropdowns, radios, and more. The more complex form fields that you can add are file upload fields, Rich text editors (TinyMCE), and the powerful Repeater field.

Powerful Custom Fields
----------------------

There are many reasons to accept donations and some donations forms require additional fields to fulfill a certain requirement. Considering this, Form Field Manager (FFM) provides you with a powerful set of custom fields to choose from:

*   Text
*   Textarea
*   Dropdown
*   Date
*   Radio
*   Checkbox
*   Email
*   File Upload
*   Phone Number
*   URL
*   Multi Select
*   Repeat Field
*   HTML
*   Section
*   Do Action

### Easily Add Custom Fields to Your Donation Forms

Before Form Field Manager the only way to add custom fields to your WordPress forms was using code. This was hardly ideal for many Give users. Now the process is much easier and more powerful than ever before!

### Reviewing Field Data is a Breeze

Once donors have given you will have access to review the fields they completed as well as edit them if need be. The data is available on the individual donation transaction screen within Give.
