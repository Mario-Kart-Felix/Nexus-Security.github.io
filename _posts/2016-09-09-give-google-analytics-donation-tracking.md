Add Google Analytics Enhanced eCommerce tracking functionality to Give to track donations.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Measure campaign success with Google Analytics’ Enhanced Ecommerce tracking. Track user interactions with donation forms across the user’s site experience, including initiating the donation process, completing a donation, admin refunds, and more.

Tracking Donations with Google Analytics’ Enhanced Ecommerce
------------------------------------------------------------

With Google Analytics Enhanced Ecommerce tracking you can take the guess work out of understanding how your website visitors donate. Enhanced Ecommerce tracking is _free_ and built right into Google Analytics. When enabled, it captures a wealth of information about your donation transactions, including transaction amount, traffic sources, most popular donation forms, and the number of visits made before a donor gave.

“But wait,” you ask “We don’t sell products…” That’s OK! Payments still occur and therefore transactions are made. This means that you can leverage the power of Enhanced Ecommerce tracking for donations, too! Read our article all about that here.

### Unlock Powerful Reporting Features

Not only do you get better transaction data within Google Analytics, but this integration also opens up access to a world of useful reports:

*   Most valuable traffic sources
*   Most popular donation forms
*   The number of visits made before a user donates
*   Which donations are refunded most
*   Which donation forms have the highest conversions

How GA Enhanced Ecommerce and Give Works
----------------------------------------

You most likely already have Google Analytics tracking implemented on your website. This Add-on doesn’t aim to replace your current integration. Rather, its goal is to _enhance _it. Simply install and activate the Add-on and immediately your donation data will begin tracking in Google Analytics.

Please note that you need to use the GA’s Universal Analytics in order to use Enhanced Ecommerce tracking. Most likely, you already are as it has been the standard for years now.

**Additional Plugin Features:**

*   Easy zero-hassle setup
*   Track conversion rates
*   Track donation form impressions
*   Customize tracking values
*   Track test donations
*   Lightweight codebase won’t slow site
*   Built to work with your existing GA implementation
