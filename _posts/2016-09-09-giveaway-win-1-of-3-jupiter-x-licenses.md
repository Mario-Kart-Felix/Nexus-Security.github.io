Meet the New Generation of Jupiter X Website Templates
------------------------------------------------------

If you have ever used readymade website templates provided by multi-purpose WordPress themes, you may have noticed the following problems with them:

### They are Beautiful but not Purposeful

You see lots of dummy text and fancy stock images stacked upon each other within sections but looking at the big picture you have a hard time understanding the purpose of the page. In other words, what is the purpose of this page and whether it serves that purpose.

### They are Likeable but not Actionable

Design of a webpage should help accomplish the global goal of a website and that very page but the usual readymade website templates does not reflect that intent. You may scroll a page from top to bottom without feeling the urge to take any action in the page. In fact the page does not require anything other than observation from you.

Meet the New Generation of Jupiter X Templates
----------------------------------------------

The [new generation of Jupiter X website templates](https://jupiterx.artbees.net/jupiter-x-templates/) introduce 75 modern website templates for different niches that artfully address these problems. 

### Purposeful Architecture

You have a niche and your website should properly reflect it. You also have a goal for your website that your website template should accordingly serve. The new Jupiter X readymade website templates are thoroughly planned and designed to serve the mission of the website as a whole and that of individual pages.

### Actionable Storytelling

All the visual elements in your template from the general layout to page sections and individual elements are in total harmony to generate leads and convert them to paying customers.

Your Jupiter X templates encourage your visitors to follow the story your page is explaining and properly guide them to do what you want them to do. Sometimes this happens with an eye-catching call-to-action box, sometimes with a subscribe box in the footer or a nice pop-up appearing with sleek animation when your visitor scrolls as little down the page
