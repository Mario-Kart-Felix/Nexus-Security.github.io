An Introduction to WC Orders Manager
------------------------------------

[WC Orders Manager](https://wcom.pro/) is currently the only WordPress plugin that enables you to filter WooCommerce orders and define additional order groups inside the admin dashboard.

By default, WooCommerce only allows you to filter the orders by their status. With this plugin, you can help store managers to organize and process the orders in a more efficient way.

Besides order statuses, you can use WooCommerce Orders Manager to group the orders by additional parameters, such as ordered products, payment methods, shipping countries, and delivery methods. It is possible to select one or more parameters to include or exclude specific orders from the custom group. After you define the new groups, each of them will be displayed in a separate admin page.

You can access the filtered orders list in just a few clicks, and you can conditionally show the pages with order groups to selected store managers. For example, you can split the orders from different countries or those with particular shipping methods and assign them to designated users.

_Make sure to [enter the raffle above](https://wpmayor.com/giveaway-wc-orders-manager-standard-license/#raffle) to get your hands on WC Orders Manager today!_
