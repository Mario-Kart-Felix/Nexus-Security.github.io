WpStream is an innovative approach to live streaming for WordPress that provides webmasters with the tools and means to include video in web pages or deploy complete video sites in minutes, with little or no prior understanding of the field.

The easy to follow tutorials will guide you into creating your own Netflix or Twitch, setting up **pay-per-view** sports broadcasting, showing off live drone footage, or pretty much anything you can imagine using internet video for.

Combined with **flexible monetization capabilities** like pay-per-item, pay-per-collection or subscriptions, WpStream is nowadays the leading force behind most WordPress premium video sites.

50% Off the First Month – Limited Time Offer!
---------------------------------------------

If you don’t want to wait for the giveaway or you’re not one of the winners, WPStream have been kind enough to offer a **50% discount on the first month** for the same “Team” package, a $24.50 value! Simply use the coupon code **WPMAYOR2019** at [WpStream’s checkout](https://wpstream.net/). This offer is limited to the first 100 claims.

We wish you the best of luck!
