Today is [#GivingTuesday](https://blog.adafruit.com/?s=%23GivingTuesday) . In the makers/electronics/engineering community we all have something we can give, our time, our talents, our code, our designs, and today we’re celebrating companies and organizations that help make this happen. We’re also celebrating organizations and people that could use your help to keep their efforts going.

We’ll be posting all day with some [#GivingTuesday](https://blog.adafruit.com/?s=%23GivingTuesday) ideas to consider, post yours and we’ll help get the word out.

> GivingTuesday is a global generosity movement unleashing the power of people and organizations to transform their communities and the world on December 3, 2019 and every day.
> 
> It was created in 2012 as a simple idea: a day that encourages people to do good. Over the past seven years, this idea has grown into a global movement that inspires hundreds of millions of people to give, collaborate, and celebrate generosity.
