> Gizmo is a robotic vehicle with a camera that can be remote-controlled over WLAN or the Internet by an Android app. The video capture of the camera can be watched online through the app. When in hearing distance, the vehicle can be controlled by voice.
> 
> The vehicle is driven by two NEMA 17 stepper motors. I decided for steppers instead of DC motors because they donâ€™t need any regulators and allow to position the vehicle with an accuracy better than one centimeter per meter. An other advantage is their high torque especially on low rotation speeds. Disadvantage are the higher weight and higher power consumption. But in my opinion, the advantages make up these weak points.
