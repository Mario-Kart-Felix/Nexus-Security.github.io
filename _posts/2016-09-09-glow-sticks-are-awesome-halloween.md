Glow Mind

Stressed about safety on Halloween night? Bust out the glow sticks. Kids can’t resist them, and it’s easy for parents (and drivers) to see a kid who’s lit up like a party bus.

A few years ago I impulsively bought a ton of glow sticks on Amazon because they were a dirt-cheap daily deal. My family and I played with a few of them, but by the end of summer, we still had a _lot_ of glow sticks left. Hundreds of them, even.

Halloween rolled around and it dawned on me the best way to get rid of the bazillion glow sticks I had was to hand them out by the handfuls to kids on Halloween.

Not only did the kids love getting the glow sticks—have you ever met a child who wasn’t totally enraptured by them?—but within the first hour of trick or treating in my neighborhood, I saw _hundreds_ of kids walking around glowing brightly in the night with the glow stick bracelets they’d picked up at our house.
