Hello All, this is my first post to this list - I just learned about its existence and someone told me that maybe it is possible to solve my issue here.
``````
 I run my own personal mailserver at rafa.eu.org for quite a few years. All the time I had absolutely no problems with sending messages to Gmail. Few weeks ago I learned that Gmail suddenly started marking e-mails that I send to Gmail users as spam. As users usually never look into their spam folders, they don't receive my mail. It happens mostly to recipients to whom I write for the first time (for example, found their e-mail address at their website and want to ask for something I'm interested in). People with whom I already corresponded earlier receive my messages as usual (ie. they aren't marked as spam), except for the case when I didn't write to this person for some time. For example, I wrote to someone two or three times half a year ago, and din't have any further messages exchange since then. If I write to him again now, the message can fall to spam. To test the issue I created a fresh account on Gmail and send a few messages to it - they ended up right in the spam folder. I repeated this for three different accounts and noticed that clicking "This is not spam" is not of much help - ie. it helps for that particular account, but doesn't influence the overall behaviour that my messages are going to spam on other accounts (unless I click "This is not spam" on those accounts too). The spam banner on the received message on Gmail account says that this message is "similar to ones already caught as spam", which is an absurd explanation because each one of the messages I sent was different. I didn't send a generic "test 123" or something similar, but tried to write an actual email message that makes some sense, different in each case. Also they are simple plain text messages without any HTML, links or attachments. Of course DNS is configured correctly, ie. rafa.eu.org resolves to IP address 217.182.79.147, and this IP address resolves back to rafa.eu.org. I'm also not blacklisted. Obviously, I have never sent any spam-like message myself nor my server wasn't relaying any. I asked on different forums and tried to follow the advices I got. Previously I didn't have SPF nor DKIM (as I wrote, for long time it was absolutely no obstacle in getting my messages received by Gmail users), so I configured them, I also published a DMARC record. DMARC reports I get from Google indicate everything as passed, the same says Gmail in details of the messages I sent to test accounts. I defined a MX record for my domain, which I didn't have previously, because rafa.eu.org has an A record, so it looked stupid (and superfluous) to me to define MX for rafa.eu.org that points simply to rafa.eu.org :), and everything works perfectly with A record only. But someone told me that Google may be suspicious about domains that don't have a MX record, so I defined it. I registered my domain and IP address at dnswl.org. I also registered for Google Postmaster Tools, but it won't show me any information since I send too few messages to Gmail users (the description says that I need at least a few hundred messages sent daily, which I'll probably never achieve :)). All this to no avail - my messages still go to spam (I just checked again on the third of the test Gmail accounts). I only learned - by reading forums - that more and more people start getting the same problem. What else can I do? It would be best to get an actual advice from someone at Google who will look into logs/config and check what actually happens. However, there seems to be no way to contact them - no contact form or something like that is published on the Gmail help pages. Any help? I'm fighting with this for several weeks now, without any success... -- Regards, Jaroslaw Rafa r...@rafa.eu.org -- "In a million years, when kids go to school, they're gonna know: once there was a Hushpuppy, and she lived with her daddy in the Bathtub." \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ mailop mailing list mailop@mailop.org [https://chilli.nosignal.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/mailop](https://chilli.nosignal.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/mailop)
