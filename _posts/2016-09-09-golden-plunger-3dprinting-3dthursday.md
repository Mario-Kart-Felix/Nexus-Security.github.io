> Exquisite plunger that looks best printed in gold. Meant to be given as a trophy to celebrate only the greatest of accomplishments of mediocrity. It is for times when you want to say “you may not have won, but I am proud of you for taking the plunge.” If you are lucky enough to receive one of these prestigious awards, proudly display it in your home, office, or by your throne so that everyone knows that you are worthy.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
