During our Limited Registration Period from December 2, 2019 to July 2020, we’ll actively review applications to operate .new domains to ensure compliance with the [.new Registration Policy](https://www.registry.google/policies/registration/new/). All registrants will be required to first apply for their desired domain names before they can register them with eligible registrars and domain names will only be allocated to proposals that align with our policies.

During General Availability, domains will be available to register directly through your registrar, meaning that we won’t review individual shortcuts prior to registration. We will continue to monitor the .new namespace for compliance with the [.new Registration Policy](https://www.registry.google/policies/registration/new/). If we discover domains that do not comply with this policy, we’ll reach out to you and give you a short window to bring your domain into compliance with the policy. If issues are not remediated within the specified period your domain may be suspended or deleted without refund.

Any domain that violates our [Domain Name Abuse Policy](https://www.registry.google/policies/domain-name-abuse/) may be deleted or suspended without warning and without refund.
