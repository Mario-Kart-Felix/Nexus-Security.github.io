G-Cam enthusiasts rejoice! It’s barely been weeks since the [Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL were launched](https://beebom.com/pixel-4-launched-price-specs-details/) by Google, but Google Camera ports are already available online, bringing a plethora of cool photography features to unsupported devices. [According to XDA,](https://www.xda-developers.com/google-camera-7-2-astrophotography-super-res-zoom-pixels/) the Google Camera 7.2 mod comes with Super Res Zoom and the new Astrophotography mode – which allows users to [capture the starry night skies](https://beebom.com/pixel-3-a-pixel-4-night-sight-update-confirmed/) in all its glory – to older Pixel smartphones.  

While the feature will officially roll out to the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3a in the coming weeks, Google left out the first-gen Pixel and Pixel 2 lineups from the support list, but now the modded G-Cam app brings the much-wanted features to those devices as well. While the Astrophotography mode is no doubt the standout feature, it will also bring other cool functionalities, as can be seen in the official changelog below.  

>   
> 
> *   _Enable Astro mode for Pixel 1 & 2_
>   
> *   _Enable Focus options in Night Sight (along with “infinity” – may be same as far)_
>   
> *   _Modded lib for Learned Depth in Portrait Mode (Pixel 2)_
>   
> *   _Enable Super Res Zoom while zoomed or in Night Sight (no zoom required) – this is like Pixel 3 stock_
>   
> *   _Enable auto timer (photobooth), it’s in the selfie camera in the Timer options_
>   
> *   _Enable synthetic fill flash for Pixel 2 and enable SFF in Camera mode for 3a_
>   

  

XDA senior member, cstark27, who worked on the mod, said they will also bring other advanced features in the weeks ahead, although, there’s no definitive timeline for that as yet.
