Have you ever wondered if a website is slowing you down or your internet connection is to blame for the delay in accessing a webpage? Well, Google is planning to add a warning to Chrome that lets you know the website’s usual access speeds and load times.  

In a blog post, the Chromium team revealed its **plans to** **add badges to “identify sites that typically load fast or slow for users”**. However, the feature will undergo changes in implementation while the team experiments to find the best possible approach to let the user know about the website’s speed.  

_“Badging is intended to identify when sites are authored in a way that makes them slow generally, looking at historical load latencies. Further along, we may expand this to include identifying when a page is likely to be slow for a user based on their device and network conditions.”,_ reads the [blog post](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/11/moving-towards-faster-web.html).  

As of now, Google plans to add warning messages on loading screens and color-sensitive progress bars. The software giant hinted that its criteria for performance evaluation will get more strict which may include “signals beyond just speed”.  

Take a look at the early version of the website speed indicator below. If you take a closer look, you will see that Google’s Blog on the right has a green progress bar indicating that the website loads comparatively faster.

If you’re interested to evaluate your website’s performance using Google’s PageSpeed Insights, enter your website’s URL [here](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/). PageSpeed Insights will provide suggestions for optimizing the speed. You can also check out [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/), Google’s automated tool for performance evaluation.  

So, do you think this is a step in the right direction for making the internet faster and skipping the annoying load times? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.
