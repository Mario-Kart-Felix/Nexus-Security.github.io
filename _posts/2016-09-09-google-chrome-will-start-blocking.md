Google will start blocking intrusive ads on short-form video content (videos less than 8 minutes in duration) by default in the [Google Chrome](https://beebom.com/best-google-chrome-alternatives/) web browser this August. To be specific, this includes **non-skippable ads longer than 31 seconds** that appear before a video starts, mid-roll ads, and ads that occupy almost one-third of the content.  

For the uninitiated, Google relies on the Better Ads Standards set by the ‘Coalition for Better Ads’ for identifying unintrusive ads. The group recently announced its [new standards](https://www.betterads.org/press-releases/cba-announces-better-ads-standard-short-form-video) after conducting research involving 45,000 consumers.  

_“Broadening the environments covered by our Better Ads Standards will benefit consumers and provide additional guidance for businesses to respond to consumer preferences,”_ said Neal Thurman, director of the Coalition for Better Ads.  

In case you are wondering, **this includes Google’s own video platform YouTube as well**. _“Similar to the previous Better Ads Standards, we’ll update our product plans across our ad platforms, including YouTube, as a result of this standard, and leverage the research as a tool to help guide product development in the future,”_ wrote Google in a blog post.  

The blog post contains GIF renders showing examples of intrusive ad experiences. Take a look at those GIFs below.

This policy will be **enforced on Chrome starting August 5 this year**. Google advises website owners with ads to review their site status in the Ad Experience Report tool to check if their current ad practices comply with these revised policies.
