But you may not have realized that you can take your forms to the next level with the right add-ons.

Save time, reduce errors, and make your forms more dynamic with these advanced Google Forms add-ons.

1\. [CheckItOut](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/checkitout/895250845562?hl=en-US&pann=cwsdp)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Make a list better with check in and check out items.**

CheckItOut is an awesome add-on if you need a form for checking in and out items. You might use this for work equipment like laptops and projectors. Or you could use it for classroom supplies like textbooks and subject-specific DVDs.

The form clearly shows items available for check-out and updates automatically as items are chosen. And when it is time to return an item, you can have participants use the form to check it back in.

Once you install the add-on, setup is simple. Create or open your form, click the **Add-ons** button, and select **CheckItOut**. In the pop-up window, pick **Add/Edit Question Set** to create your question.

When the sidebar opens, give it a **Set Name**, choose a question type, and then fill out the empty text for checked in and checked out items. Click the **Add** button and the questions will populate in your form. Then, just add your list of items to the Check Out question.

2\. [Choice Eliminator 2](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/choice_eliminator_2/878487335710?hl=en-US&pann=cwsdp)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Eliminates options from a multiple-choice, drop-down, or checkbox type of question.**

For removing answers to questions after they have been chosen, check out Choice Eliminator 2. This add-on is handy for forms where a limited amount of answers is acceptable. For instance, you could use it for scheduling times for parent-teacher conferences or employee annual reviews.

You can set the number of times answers can be picked before they are removed from the form. Using the annual review example, you could have employees choose what time they are available to meet. Once someone picks a time, it is removed from the form so that no other employee can select the same time.

Once you install the add-on, create or open your form. Click the **Add-ons** button and select **Choice Eliminator 2**. In the pop-up window, pick **Configure** to create your question.

When the sidebar opens, choose a data sheet for your responses, and mark the **Eliminate Choices** checkbox for add-on questions. By default, the limit will be one response per item; however, you can change this by clicking the **gear** icon. Then, adjust limits as needed, rearrange answers, and add text when no options are left for the participant.

3\. [Dynamic Fields](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dynamic-fields/ipeckgnbnbjgljjnpajhafjmnliihdef)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Update form fields with dynamic data.**

If you work with spreadsheets of data that you would like to use in Google Forms, Dynamic Fields is the add-on for you. You can populate answers to questions with data from Google Sheets, Drive, Contacts, or Groups.

If you use forms for product orders or where employees need to choose their name from a list, this is a great data-mapping tool. Once you choose the data source, just pick the specific sheet and column from your spreadsheet for the question.

Just install the add-on and then create or open your form. Click the **Add-ons** button and select **Dynamic Fields**. In the pop-up window, pick **Create Mapping** to begin. Then complete each field to populate the data and click **Save** when you finish.

After you create the mapping, you must update the form. Open the add-on from the button once again and this time, select **Update Mapping**. Once complete, you will see a confirmation message of the update along with the changes to your form.

4\. [formRanger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/formranger/faepkjkcpnnghgdhiobglpppbfdnaehc)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Quickly auto-populate a multiple choice list.**

formRanger works similarly to Dynamic Fields allowing you to populate form answers from a spreadsheet (currently only Google Sheets). But there are a couple of differences that you might prefer with this add-on.

First, form Ranger will display all applicable form questions within the sidebar. Rather than choosing one at a time and opening the add-on, you can take care of all questions at once. Next, this tool lets you enable the automatic re-population of questions upon form submission or every hour.

Finally, when selecting your data, formRanger provides a simple preview. This is a nice feature for reducing the risk of picking the wrong sheet or column.

Once you install the add-on, the rest is easy. Create or open your form, click the **Add-ons** button, and select **FormRanger**. In the pop-up window, pick **Start** to begin. Then complete each field to populate the data by selecting your source, sheet, and column in the pop-up window. Click **Next**, name your values list, and hit the **Save and Populate Question button**. That’s it!

5\. [FormLimiter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/formlimiter/clflahnkjeannplpafofekagclpmijkl)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Stop the form from accepting responses after a specific number.**

You never have to remember to close a form with FormLimiter. This convenient add-on lets you stop form submissions based on a date or number or received responses. You could use this if you are collecting data in order to offer a promotion such as “the first X to respond receive a coupon.” Or use it if you need the information to meet a deadline for a product distributor.

Install the add-on and create or open your form. Then, click the **Add-ons** button, and select **FormLimiter**. In the pop-up window, pick **Set limit** to get started.

You can then choose to close the form on a specific date and time or after a certain number of responses. You can also adjust the messages displayed for both options on the form. And for more convenience, you can enable an email notification to yourself when submissions are closed.

6\. [QR Code Maker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/qr-code-maker/pckehlndgkbjfjdagdbcdhldacdpmbba)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Generate a QR code for your form.**

Another super handy tool for your Google Forms is the QR Code Maker. You can use this to offer more flexibility to your participants. Just add the code to your form or share it and others can access your form from their mobile device with a simple scan.

Once you install the add-on, the set-up is simple. Create or open your form, click the **Add-ons** button, and select **QR Code Maker**. In the next window, pick **Get the QR Code of my Form**. Your QR code will then display in a pop-up window along with the URL for the form.

You can then click the button to add the code to your form. Or, if you plan to distribute your code and do not want it on the form, copy the URL and hit **Done** to close the window. Note that if you add it to your form, it may take a bit for the code to display. You can also click your browser refresh button on that page to move it along faster.
