Google has announced that Cloud Print, which lets you easily print things from the web using Google Chrome (even on printers that lack an internet connection), will print its final pages on December 31st, 2020. [_9to5Google_](https://9to5google.com/2019/11/21/google-cloud-print-dead-2020/)  reported on the news. Cloud Print has been a handy service, as it works both on desktop and mobile and gives extended utility to older printers. Interestingly, despite being introduced [back in 2010](https://www.popsci.com/gadgets/article/2010-04/google-cloud-print-allow-printing-any-device-any-printer-anywhere/), Google Cloud Print still has a beta tag.

  

In [a support document](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9633006), Google recommends using the printing experience that’s baked into Chrome OS or, if you’re on a different OS, using “the respective platform’s native printing infrastructure.”

  

Some Twitter users are mourning the death of Cloud Print, which is probably part of the reason why Google has provided more than a year’s notice before it shuts off the service for good:

The company hasn’t given a reason for why it’s sending Cloud Print to the [Google graveyard](https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/10/4/20899198/google-reader-gravestone-crypt-rip-picasa-buzz-wave-orkut), but _The Verge_ has asked Google for comment and will update this article with anything we hear.
