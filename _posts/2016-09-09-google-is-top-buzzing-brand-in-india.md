_“The BrandIndex report sees a dominance of global technology brands who, with their constant innovations, have managed to create a lot of positive chatter amongst Indian consumers. Hence, they lead the race when it comes to brands with the most positive buzz in India. It also shows that the Indian consumer is very engaged with online brands and technology,”_ says Deepa Bhatia, general manager at YouGov India.  

To compile the list, YouGov ranked 260 brands by conducting a survey where they asked respondents if they heard anything about the brand in the past two weeks through multiple sources including advertising, news or word of mouth. They also asked if the message was positive or negative.  

Based on the responses, YouGov came up with the buzz scores by subtracting the percentage of negative responses from the percent of positive responses. YouGov also noted the brands that improved their Buzz scores when compared to 2018.  

**Uber Eats, which [recently got acquired by Zomato ](https://beebom.com/zomato-acquires-ubereats-india-2500-crore/)showed the highest improvement**. Swiggy came close with 8.3 and Punjab National Bank follows the lead with a 6.8 buzz score improvement.
