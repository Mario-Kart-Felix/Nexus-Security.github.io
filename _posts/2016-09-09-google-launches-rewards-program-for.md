Google has launched Google Play Points, a rewards program for Android users. Google Play Points lets you earn points by using Google Play. You can earn points in a number of different ways, and then use those points for a myriad of different rewards.

In September 2018, Google debuted Google Play Points in Japan. Then, in April 2019, it launched in South Korea too. Google claims that millions of people have joined the program, and that success has moved the company to launch Play Points in the US.

How Google Play Points Works
----------------------------

Google announced Google Play Points in a post on [The Keyword](https://www.blog.google/products/google-play/google-play-points-rewards-program-all-ways-you-play/). The company states that Play Points is a way of rewarding the 2 billion people in 190 countries who now use Google Play. Which suggests it’s looking to expand Play Points worldwide.

Google Play Points is free to join, with no fees involved whatsoever. Once you’ve joined, you’ll earn points on everything you buy with Google Play and by downloading featured free apps and games. There will also be weekly points events to earn more points.

There are four levels to Google Play Points: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. The more points you earn, the higher your level. And the higher your level, the more perks (such as weekly prizes) you’ll receive. This is designed to keep you engaged.

Once you’ve starting earning points, you can redeem them for a range of things. This includes in-app items like characters and gems, plus Google Play Credit which you can then use to rent a movie, buy an audiobook, or whatever else takes your fancy.
