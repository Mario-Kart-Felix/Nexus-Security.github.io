[Google](https://beebom.com/tag/google-2/) has a tradition of picking and honoring the best apps that follow its material design guidelines. The company revealed the winners of the 2019 Material Design Awards earlier this week and chances are, you might not have even heard of them.  

So, let’s take a look at the four apps picked by Google to know how they stand out from the millions of apps that follow material design guidelines. The winners are classified into four categories namely Theming, Innovation, Experience, and Universality.  

1\. Theming – Ruff
------------------

Ruff is a less known note-taking app with just over 5,000 downloads. The app has a consistent material design in terms of color and typography. The notes are displayed on a material-style bottom sheet. There is a blue floating action button in the app where additional features of the app are accessible.  

The app comes with three theme options – Light, Dark, and Black. Also, you can set the size and weight of the text for your notes. Overall, it is a well-designed app and I do think it deserves its award after my brief time of testing.

Scripts is an app that teaches you how to read and write languages. It has an intuitive writing tool that shows the structure of the alphabet over which you can practice writing.  

Minor user experience tweaks like subtle animations and haptic feedback are present to guide users when they go wrong. The app also has fun-filled fast-paced games to engage yourself in the process of learning.

To wrap the list up, we have the app from Trip.com – a flight, hotel, and train booking service. As you might have guessed by the category, Google appreciates the app’s availability in 19 languages. The app offers a straightforward layout that is easily understandable by people while managing to add all the essential features one would need from a travel booking service.
