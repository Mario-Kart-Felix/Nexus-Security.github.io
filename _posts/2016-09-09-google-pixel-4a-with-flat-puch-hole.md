![](https://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Google-Pixel-4a-leak-1024x748.jpg) Google launched the Pixel 3a smartphone last year in India and brought back the 3.5mm headphone jack after removing it from Pixel 3. The company recently launched its flagship Pixel 4 recently and it did not launch in India. Now renders of the upcoming Pixel 4a have surfaced revealing the design and key details, and it could launch in India too if it does not come with Project Soli. According to the renders, Pixel 4a is said to sport a 5.7-inch or 5.8-inch flat display and thick bezels around the display. In comparison, Pixel 3a sports a 5.5-inch FULL HD+ OLED display. The renders also reveal an in-screen camera to the front, a square rear camera module that is said to house a single camera, and a 3.5mm audio jack. Pixel 4a is said to be smaller in comparison to Pixel 3a. Furthermore, the Pixel 4a is said to sport a rear-mounted physical fingerprint scanner, USB Type-C port, speaker grilles, similar to Pixel 3a. Although the rear square camera module is said to house only a single camera, it is said to be accompanied by "more sensors". Rest of the specifications are not known yet, but we can expect it to be powered ...
