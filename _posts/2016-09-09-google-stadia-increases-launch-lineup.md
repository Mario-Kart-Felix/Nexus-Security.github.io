Google’s VP and General Manager, Phil Harrison, has just announced that the official launch lineup for the company’s [Stadia game streaming service](https://beebom.com/google-stadia-app-listed-on-the-play-store-ahead-of-november-19-launch/) has increased to 22 titles from the 12 announced last week. The updated list includes a whole host of popular titles, including _Final Fantasy XV_, _Metro Exodus_, _Wolfenstein: Youngblood_, _Football Manager 2020_ and more. What’s more, _Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Breakpoint_, a game that was slated to hit the service next year, will also be available by the end of 2019.
