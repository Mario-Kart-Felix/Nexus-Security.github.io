[Google to acquire Fitbit, valuing smartwatch maker at $2.1 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/google-to-acquire-fitbit-valuing-the-smartwatch-maker-at-about-2point1-billion.html).

> Google parent company Alphabet will buy Fitbit, putting the tech giant head to head with Apple in the fitness tracking space. The deal values Fitbit around $2.1 billion at a fully diluted equity value, according to [Friday’s announcement](https://investor.fitbit.com/press/press-releases/press-release-details/2019/Fitbit-to-Be-Acquired-by-Google/default.aspx).

Some details/guesses maybe.. Fitbit 2019 revenue was estimated at about $1.45 billion, so purchase price was about 2x.

[In September of 2019, Google reportedly paid $40 million to Fossil](https://www.cnet.com/news/googles-40m-purchase-of-fossil-tech-was-for-hybrid-smartwatches-report-says/) …

> Google’s $40 million acquisition of Fossil’s tech earlier this year was reportedly for hybrid smartwatches. Fossil’s technology is internally called Project Diana, stemming from the combination of the words “digital” and “analog,”

What’s Facebook up to? Not sure for this space, however I tried to run down this story but there’s not much there… [“Facebook Acquires CTRL-Labs For ‘Less Than $1 Billion’”](https://medium.com/supplyframe-hardware/facebook-acquires-ctrl-labs-for-less-than-1-billion-920fdbea68d0) … looks like a neural interface device based on the [CTRL-Labs purchased of the patents](https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/27/ctrl-labs-acquires-myo-armband-patents-from-north-joins-openxr-working-group/) of the [Myo band (our teardown here)](https://learn.adafruit.com/myo-armband-teardown).

8 years ago-ish on MAKE Magazine I wrote “[Is the Rise of Wearable Electronics Finally Here?”](https://makezine.com/2011/06/21/is-the-rise-of-wearable-electronics-finally-here/).
