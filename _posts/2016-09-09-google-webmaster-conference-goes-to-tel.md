We are happy to let you know that the [Google Webmaster Conference](https://events.withgoogle.com/webmaster-conference-tlv-2019/) is coming to Tel Aviv, Israel this winter!  
  
If you are looking for an opportunity to socialize with the Search engineering team, or to hear from us what we’ve been working on, here is your chance! We’re planning lots of interesting content: John Mueller on Search, Andre Naumann on Trust & Safety, Daniel Waisberg on structured data, and many more speakers from the Search Console team.  
  
**The event will take place on December 4th, between 15:00 and 19:00 in the Google Tel Aviv offices. [Learn more and apply for a spot](https://events.withgoogle.com/webmaster-conference-tlv-2019/) at our website.**
