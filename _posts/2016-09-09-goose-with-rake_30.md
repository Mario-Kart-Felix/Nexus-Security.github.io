> Scaled the rake file to match the overall dimension of the untitled goose model found here:
> 
> Designed a handle that will fit very snugly without the need for glue. I had some .2mm round magnets and tossed a 4 of them in the hole of the rake and then inserted the handle. Holds perfectly and works well with the model and does not unbalance the goose.
> 
> Thank you to gynni for their goose model and Thank you to jsc for the hand rake model!
> 
> Printed the handle in hatchbox wood pla and the rake in hatchbox green pla.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!

The [Adafruit Learning System](http://learn.adafruit.com) has dozens of great tools to get you well on your way to creating incredible works of engineering, interactive art, and design with your 3D printer! If you’ve made a cool project that combines 3D printing and electronics, be sure to let us know, and we’ll [feature](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) it here!
