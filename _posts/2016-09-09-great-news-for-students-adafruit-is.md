Great news for students! Adafruit is part of the [GitHub Student Developer Pack!](https://www.adafruit.com/github-students) What is the [GitHub Student Developer Pack?](https://education.github.com/pack)

> _GitHub is committed to students having access to the best real-world tools and training required to get started as developers. As students prepare to return to school for the spring semester, we’re doubling the value of the GitHub Student Developer Pack (the Pack)._
> 
> This January, we’re welcoming 22 new partners, increasing the total value of tools and training included to more than $200k per student. And each offer is available to every student developer, anywhere that GitHub is available.
> 
> Whether you’re building your first website, localizing your app for the global market, or even hardware hacking—the Pack provides you with the tools you need to be successful.

> **A few words from our new partners**  
> We ask all of our new partners what advice they’d like to share with students, and why they joined the Pack. Here’s a sample of what they told us:
> 
> _“Publish, publish, publish! From code to well-documented pages with markdown, the more \[students\] publish and share, the more opportunities will come your way!” -Limor Fried, Adafruit_
