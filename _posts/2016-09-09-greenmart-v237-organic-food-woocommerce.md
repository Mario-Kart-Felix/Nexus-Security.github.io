So, whether you are willing to license one of your Macs to access your entire jukebox or planning to sell/give away or send your computer to service, follow along as I show how you can authorize or deauthorize your Mac for iTunes Store purchases in [macOS Catalina](https://beebom.com/macos-catalina-features/) without any hassle.  

Authorize or Deauthorize Mac for iTunes Store Purchases on macOS Catalina
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

To get started, I would like to brief you about the whole process so that you can get a good hang of it right at the beginning.  

### So, Does the Whole Process Work Without iTunes?

  

First off, we are going to unhide the iTunes Store. Yeah, you heard it right! Apple has slightly kept the media library out of sight but you can easily make it show in the stock music app. Once that is done, it becomes business as usual as it has always been. Now that everything is crystal clear, let’s dive straight into the step-by-step breakdown!  

Show iTunes Store in Music App on macOS
---------------------------------------

  

1.  Launch **Music app** on your Mac.
  

![Open Music app on macOS](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Open-Music-app-on-macOS-.jpg)

2\. Now, click on the **Music menu** and choose **Preferences. **

3\. Ensure that the **General** tab is selected. Then, check the box for **Show** located to the left of the **iTunes Store**. After that, click on **OK** to finish.

From now onwards, the iTunes Store will show up in the sidebar of the music app. Thus, you can access all of your content. If you ever want to hide it, return to the Music preferences and then uncheck the box for the iTunes Store in the end.

You can also view all of your authorized computers right from the music app. Make sure you are signed in to your account.  

1.  Open **Music app** on your Mac. Then, click on the **Account** menu and choose **View My Account**.
  

![Click on View Account in the Account section](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Click-on-View-Account-in-the-Account-section.jpg)

2\. Now, you may be prompted to sign in using your Apple ID. Do it.  

On the **Account Information page**, go to the **Apple ID summary section**. Now, check out the **number of computers** you have authorized with your Apple ID.  

![See Your Authorized Computers](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/See-Your-Authorized-Computers-.jpg)

Keep in mind, this section won’t appear if you haven’t authorized two or more computers.  

### Deauthorize All the Computers

  

Just in case, you no longer use any computers which you had authorized earlier, you can deauthorize all of them at one go. To do so, click on the **Deauthorize All** option on the Account info page and confirm.

_**Note:** macOS Catalina lets you see your authorized computers from Apple TV and Apple Books apps as well. The process is quite similar. _

So, that’s the right way to manage all the authorized Macs for iTunes Store purchases.
