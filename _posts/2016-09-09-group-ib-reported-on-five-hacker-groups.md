The main hacker groups threatening Russian banks are Cobalt, Silence, MoneyTaker, Lazarus and SilentCards. They can hack a Bank, reach isolated financial systems and withdraw funds, said Ilya Sachkov, CEO and founder of Group-IB, a company specializing in preventing cyber attacks.  
  
At the same time, hacker groups are shifting their focus from Russia to other countries.  
  
According to the founder of Group-IB, "it is curious that three of the five groups (Cobalt, Silence, MoneyTaker) are Russian-speaking, but over the last year Cobalt and Silence began to attack banks mainly outside Russia".  
  
"For example, Silence began its activities in Russia, but gradually shifted its focus to the CIS, and then entered the international market. Group-IB analysts have [detected Silence attacks in more than 30 countries in Europe](https://www.ehackingnews.com/2019/08/russian-speaking-hacker-group-silence.html), Asia and the CIS for the current year," said Sachkov.  
  
According to him, the pro-government hackers of developed countries are the most dangerous, since their activity is less noticeable, while they have a better arsenal for carrying out attacks.  
  
"Our last year's forecast came true. The number of targeted attacks aimed at espionage, sabotage or obtaining direct financial benefits has grown significantly. So-called "digital weapons" or cyberweapons, which can stop production processes and disable networks of critical infrastructure and large commercial enterprises, are actively used. This is a serious problem. The number of cyber attacks will increase and it will be more difficult to resist them, " added Sachkov.  
  
The head of the company Group-IB also said that cybercriminals began to use a new method of stealing money from Bank customers by installing remote access programs on smartphones. The monthly losses of large banks from this type of fraud can reach 6-10 million rubles.  
  
He noted that the Secure Bank system monthly records of more than 1 thousand attempts to steal money from the accounts of individuals using this scheme.  
  
Earlier it was [reported](https://www.ehackingnews.com/2019/10/cyber-criminals-use-new-method-to-steal.html) about a new way of stealing from Bank cards. Hackers pose as Bank employees using the technology to substitute phone numbers.
