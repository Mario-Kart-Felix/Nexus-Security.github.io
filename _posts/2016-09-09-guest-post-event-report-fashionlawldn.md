A few days ago, the second fashion law event of Fashion Law London, an initiative of which I am part, took place in London. **[Gemma Louise Nimmo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gemma-louise-nimmo-8a60b810a/)**, a future trainee solicitor at CMS, was also there and now reports on what happened that day.  
  
Over to Gemma:  

  

In the lavish setting of a private members’ club on Pall Mall, London-based **[Rosie Burbidge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosieburbidge/)**, **[Giulia Gasparin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giulia-gasparin-63422b84/)** and **[Eleonora Rosati](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eleonorarosati/)** held their second event - The Fashion Law London Autumn/Winter Review.

  

The trio’s success with their first Review, the Spring/Summer Review, prompted the decision to hold another in the Fashion Law London series. Taking place on Friday 18th October, the day itself was advertised as an opportunity to “catch up with the latest fashion (law) trends; hear from industry innovators, world-leading luxury law experts, and those behind the most disruptive fashion businesses; and, join a frank and collaborative environment where you are at the centre of discussion,” and safe to say, it most certainly delivered. With a line-up of luxury brand creators, Intellectual Property icons, and fashion technology experts, this event was one not to be missed.

  

**JOANNA DAI **

The day kicked off with a talk from **[Joanna Dai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joannadai/)**, founder of contemporary womenswear brand, DAI. Joanna inspired her audience by recounting her bold move from the world of finance into the unknown territory of the fashion industry. 

  

Previously an analyst at J.P Morgan, Joanna explained that the inspiration for her brand came from a dislike of the uncomfortable and impractical nature of professional workwear. Joanna’s key aim for the brand was to create a collection for the modern businesswoman that looked powerful but was as comfortable and wearable as yoga wear. In their own words, DAI has since then “created the intersection of performance fabrics, elegant tailoring, and honest premium quality.” 

  

Joanna’s honest recollection of her transition from comfortable, successful financial analyst to inexperienced fashion designer, to owner of a thriving premium brand was truly riveting. You can check out DAI’s latest collection here: [**https://daiwear.com/**](https://daiwear.com/)

  

**ELEONORA ROSATI**

Co-founder of the event, Eleonora Rosati, talked us through the latest copyright issues currently impacting the fashion industry. Those attending the event were fortunate to hear Eleonora’s insights on how recent case law is set to affect the industry and the practical implications of the decisions given. 

  

Eleonora covered a variety of cases, some involving huge household names in the beauty and fashion industries. Eleonora offered a truly current and dynamic perspective on these issues, and how they are likely to affect both the fashion and legal spheres in the future. 

  

**FREDERICK MOSTERT **

Event goers were also lucky enough to hear from Intellectual Property legend, **[Professor Frederick Mostert](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/frederick-mostert)**, as he talked us through the perils of counterfeit goods. Frederick, an internationally recognised authority on a variety of intellectual property issues, recalled jovial anecdotes of working alongside Jackie Chan in his quest against counterfeit products, all whilst hammering home a far more important and solemn message about the reality of counterfeit products. 

  

Frederick discussed the somewhat lesser known truth about the illegal slave and child labour which goes into creating counterfeits, the dangerous working conditions and countless deaths involved, as well as the links to organised crime which the final consumer may be oblivious to. The key takeaway from Frederick’s segment? Always be conscious of the origin of your purchases, as a harmless ‘bargain’ may not always be so harmless. 

  

**ROSIE BURBIDGE **

Another of the event’s co-founders, Rosie Burbidge, spoke to us about ‘Fashion Law in Practice’. Rosie highlighted recent cases with regards to trade marks and designs, and the implications these cases would have on the fashion industry at present.

  

Rosie highlighted some pertinent issues in the area of trade marks and designs and made reference on the day to the then very recently issued Advocate General’s opinion in the CJEU case, SkyKick. Rosie, like other speakers on the day, provided a hugely practical and bang up to date account of the picture of fashion law at present, whilst also accounting for what this may look like upon the event of Brexit. 

  

**BILYANA GEORGIEVA, MO WHITE AND KAM CHOVET – TECH PANEL TALK **

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sPVqe4Hb66M/XbfqOYd4_iI/AAAAAAAAM4c/ry0vxQtn39Eb6oVI0xvgBT1mRhFAW37wgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Picture%2B1.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sPVqe4Hb66M/XbfqOYd4_iI/AAAAAAAAM4c/ry0vxQtn39Eb6oVI0xvgBT1mRhFAW37wgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Picture%2B1.png)

  

Tech aficionados and amateurs alike were treated to a highly beneficial panel talk on the role that new and upcoming technologies are playing within the fashion industry. **[Bilyana Georgieva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/executivedirector/)**, **[Mo White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/whitemo/)** and **[Kam Chovet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamchovet/)** discussed a variety of technological innovations currently changing the way the fashion industry, among other industries, operates. 

  

The trio discussed the fate of the high street, highlighting the importance which technology plays in maintaining a polished online and mobile presence which complements the physical store. Offering a well-rounded consumer experience that keeps the customer coming back, so said the panel, is key. Thought-provoking topics emerging from questions asked by the audience ranged from Artificial Intelligence on the high street, to the store as an experiential event. Those attending the event were truly fortunate to hear from the panel’s wealth of experience in these areas, learning of the absolute necessity for fashion brands to keep moving with the times in order to stay afloat. 

  

**GIULIA GASPARIN **

Co-founder of the event, Giulia Gasparin, talked us through a variety of E-commerce platforms and the variety of technical solutions currently available to fashion brands that can enhance their provision of services. Using her experience as Senior Legal Counsel at River Island, Giulia compared a variety of technical solutions on offer to the fashion and legal industry, whilst also analysing the regulatory framework impacting these solutions.

  

Again, like her fellow co-founders, Giulia offered a highly practical and extremely innovative analysis of the technological solutions available to the fashion industry. For lawyers in search of inventive new ways to assist their clients and bring their practices fully into the 21st century, Giulia’s section was invaluable. 

  

**FIONA THATCHER**

**[Fiona Thatcher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fionathatcher/)**’s segment on how to manage the social media influencer was a great insight into the marketing of goods and services through social media personalities. Fiona guided us through her practical experience of social media Influencers as a senior lawyer at luxury jewellery brand, Atelier Swarovski, offering her expertise on how to utilise such individuals and also manage them effectively. 

  

Fiona’s segment was highly relevant and hugely beneficial to all of us interested in fashion law, and a welcome reminder of the highly specific rules and guidelines that must be enforced in influencer contracts to ensure the given brand’s products are marketed successfully. 

  

**IJAZ AKRAM **

Winding up the day, **[Ijaz Akram](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ijazakram/)** spoke about the beneficial role of Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence within the fashion industry. 

  

Far from just a techy buzzword, Ijaz spoke positively to us about the real benefits of blockchain in combatting counterfeit goods, tracking shipments, aiding sustainability, and much more. 

  

**TO SUM UP… **

  

The event's line-up of inspirational and innovative speakers and topics of discussion ranging anywhere from technology to trademarks really made the Fashion Law London – Autumn/Winter Review an event that was truly worth attending. 

  

The lectures given on the day were robust whilst remaining accessible to all levels of the profession. Whether you’re a student with an interest in Fashion Law, or a fully experienced Fashion Lawyer in the peak of their career, future events held by Rosie, Eleonora and Giulia are not to be missed. 

  

The next Fashion Law London events will be held in London on 28/2/20, and Milan on 6/3/20. Find out more **[here](http://fashionlawllondon.mystrikingly.com/)**.
