> One of the finest spectacles in astronomy is to witness the passage of one object in front of another. This can transpire as an eclipse, an occultation, or a rare event known as a planetary transit. We get a shot at seeing just such a singular event next Monday on November 11th, as a [transit of Mercury across](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/events/2019/11/11/watch-the-transit-of-mercury-2019/) the face of Sol occurs for the last time this decade.
> 
> The event and who will see it: the duration for the transit is a leisurely 5 hours, 28 minutes and 47 seconds. The event is well placed for South America and eastern North America, which will witness the transit in its entirety. Western North America will seeing the transit in progress at sunrise, while Africa, Europe and the Middle East will see the transit underway at sunset. Keep in mind, watching the transit low to the horizon near sunrise or sunset will also give photographers a chance to catch the Sun, plus the ‘shadow’ outline of Mercury along with the silhouettes of foreground objects on the horizon, making for a very photogenic spectacle.
