Here’s a fresh update to the CircuitPython BLE Heart Rate Training Zone guide — now, [we’ve got a CLUE version](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-ble-heart-rate-monitor-gizmo/clue-heart-rate-trainer)! This added page gives you all you need to to code up the CLUE to receive BLE heart rate monitor info, including your BPM and Target heart rate percentage.

This version adds the ability to enter custom max heart rate values right on the CLUE board itself, using the buttons and cap sense touch pads. Plus, the on-board speaker is used to sound the alarm when you exceed 90% of your max.
