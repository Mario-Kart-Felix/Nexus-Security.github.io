We’ve updated the [Adafruit MicroLipo and MiniLipo Battery Chargers guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-microlipo-and-minilipo-battery-chargers/) to include the new USB Type C micro-lipo charger! Like the other chargers already in this guide, this board allows you to use USB C to charge your micro-lipo batteries. However, there’s more to this one! We’ve also exposed the data lines so you can use it as a USB-C breakout with your favorite microcontroller. The guide now has a [Pinouts page](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-microlipo-and-minilipo-battery-chargers/pinouts) for the new USB Type C charger, and additional material on the [Downloads page](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-microlipo-and-minilipo-battery-chargers/downloads).
