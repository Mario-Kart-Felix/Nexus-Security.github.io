Weâ€™ve updated the [TMP006 Infrared Sensor Breakout guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/infrared-thermopile-sensor-breakout/overview) to include [CircuitPython and Python Usage](https://learn.adafruit.com/infrared-thermopile-sensor-breakout/python-circuitpython). The new [CircuitPython and Python section](https://learn.adafruit.com/infrared-thermopile-sensor-breakout/python-circuitpython) shows you how to wire the TMP006 up to a Feather M4 Express and a Raspberry Pi, and walks you through reading the temperature value from the sensor. A [full code example](https://learn.adafruit.com/infrared-thermopile-sensor-breakout/python-circuitpython#full-example-code-4-14) shows you how to print the temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.
