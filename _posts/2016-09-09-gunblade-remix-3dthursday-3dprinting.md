> I used Blender 3D to slice up the original files. First I cut the blade in half and added a tab that would add strength when it is glued together. You may need to sand the tab to get a perfect fit. Next I split the handle from the frame and added the grips to the handle. They were originally separated so you could print them in a different color but since I was going to paint mine I printed them at the same time. I also added a tab on the handle. Then I removed the chamber and created a shaft. Slide the chamber onto the shaft then glue the shaft to the frame. This allows the chamber to rotate. I never made bullets so I just glued some fender washers over the holes.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
