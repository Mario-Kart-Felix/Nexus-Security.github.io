**Haaukins - A Highly Accessible And Automated Virtualization Platform For Security Education**

  

  

Haaukins is a highly accessible and automated [virtualization](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Virtualization "virtualization") platform for security education, it has three main components (Docker, [Virtualbox](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Virtualbox "Virtualbox") and Golang), the communication and orchestration between the components managed using Go programming language. The main reason of having Go environment to manage and deploy something on Haaukins platform is that Go’s easy concurrency and parallelism mechanism. Want to get more insight about architecture of Haaukins visit [architecture page](https://github.com/aau-network-security/haaukins/wiki/Architecture-of-Haaukins "architecture page")  
Our primary aim to involve anyone who desire to learn capturing the flag concept in cyber security which is widely accepted approach to learn how to find [vulnerability](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Vulnerability "vulnerability") on a system. Despite of all existing platform, Haaukins provides its own virtualized environment to you with operating system which designed to find vulnerabilities  
  
  
****Prerequisites****  
The following dependencies are required and must be installed separately in order to run daemon in your local environment.

*   Linux
*   Docker
*   Go 1.13+

There is no prerequisites for installing client to your environment.

>  **Note**: Linux can be used in virtualized environment as well.

  
****Installation****  
To install daemon or client of Haaukins, there are some options, via [binary](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Binary "binary") files, which are ready to use, visit [releases](https://github.com/aau-network-security/haaukins/releases "releases") page.  
More information about installation process, checkout following pages ;

*    [Installation for client](https://github.com/aau-network-security/haaukins/wiki/Installation "Installation for client")
*    [Configuration for daemon](https://github.com/aau-network-security/haaukins/wiki/Configuring-the-daemon "Configuration for daemon")  
    *    There are some configuration files to configure daemon, those configuration files should be in same directory with the binary file that you have just downloaded from [releases](https://github.com/aau-network-security/haaukins/releases "releases") page.
    *    Want to try daemon on you local computer with pre-configured vagrant file check out this [repo](https://github.com/aau-network-security/sec0x "repo") for more information.

  
****Getting Dependencies****  
Haaukins platform uses `go modules` since version [1.6.4](https://github.com/aau-network-security/haaukins/releases/tag/1.6.4 "1.6.4"), hence it is quite easy to manage dependencies, you just need to run `go mod download`  
  
****Testing****  
Make sure that you are in `$GOPATH/src/github.com/aau-network-security/haaukins/` directory, to run all test files, following command can be used

```
go test -v -short ./...
```

  
****Re-compile proto****  
Haaukins platform uses gRPC on communication of client and daemon, so after updating the protocol buffer specification (i.e. daemon/proto/daemon.proto), corresponding [golang](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/golang "golang") code generation is done by doing the following:

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/aau-network-security/haaukins/daemon/  
protoc -I proto/ proto/daemon.proto --go_out=plugins=grpc:proto
```

  
****Version release****  
In order to release a new version, run the `script/release/release.go` script as follows (choose depending on type of release):

```
$ go run $GOPATH/src/github.com/aau-network-security/haaukins/scripts/release/release.go major  
$ go run $GOPATH/src/github.com/aau-network-security/haaukins/scripts/release/release.go minor  
$ go run $GOPATH/src/github.com/aau-network-security/haaukins/scripts/release/release.go patch
```

The script will do the following:

*   Bump the version in `VERSION` and commit to git
*   Tag the current `HEAD` with the new version
*   Create new branch(es), which depends on the type of release.
*   Push to git

Travis automatically creates a release on GitHub and deploys on `server`.  
Note: by default the script uses the `~/.ssh/id_rsa` key to push to GitHub. You can override this settings by the `HKN_RELEASE_PEMFILE` env var.
