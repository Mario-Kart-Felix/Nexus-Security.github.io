### Hack-a-Mol

This page is designed especially for students of [cheminformatics](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/careers/college-to-career/chemistry-careers/cheminformatics.html) who are just starting to learn about how chemical structures are represented digitally.  
  
With this page you can draw a structure in 2D, compare that with its 3D structure, and also see its structural data in a variety of formats. You can also enter a chemical identifier -- a chemical name, a [SMILES](http://opensmiles.org/) string, or a [Chemical Abstracts Registry Number](http://www.cas.org/content/chemical-substances/faqs), for instance -- in the box under the JSmol window.  
  
If you hack the structural data (carefully!) and then press ENTER, the 2D and 3D structures will update.  
  
You can also drag-drop a structure file into the JSmol window or copy/paste it into the textarea.
