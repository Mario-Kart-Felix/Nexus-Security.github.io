[Hackaday has posted](https://hackaday.com/2020/02/13/tell-time-contest-winners-clocks-to-knock-your-socks-off/) the winners of their Tell Time Contest and there are some really great clock projects!

> The one that’s going to steal your heart is [_Fetch: A Ferrofluid Display_](https://hackaday.io/project/167056-fetch-a-ferrofluid-display). Pitting the force of gravity against electromagnetism, this project manages to wrangle a liquid into the segments of a display and the animations used to change between numbers are fascinating. It’s a wickedly complicated system and the gang over at Applied Procrastination did a great job of documenting the research and development that went into building this open source marvel.

There are some really novel designs like the movie Alien face hugger clock ([click this link](https://hackaday.io/project/19829-alien-cuckoo-clock), a bit scary for Valentine’s Day).

[This 7 segment clock](https://hackaday.io/project/165822-circuitpython-7-segment-character-clock), a runner-up by Alex Padilla, is really neat, programmed in [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/).

> I was inspired by Mohit Bhoite’s electronic sculpture projects, particularly [this one](https://www.instagram.com/p/BrXwPSWHyQe/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) featuring a 7-segment display.  I don’t have that caliber of soldering or programming skills, but Adafruit’s [CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/what-is-circuitpython) looked like a good way to quickly program a small project and the [ItsyBitsy M0 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3727) had capacitive touch capability to easily provide inputs.  I used the [RTC+SD Featherwing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2922) as the middle layer between the ItsyBitsy and the [7-segment display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3109) because it has a double row of headers and the inner set of headers just happened to match the width of the headers on the ItsyBitsy M0.  I made 1:1 scale drawings of the boards to plan the bends in the [brass rods](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001APJ0OG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), and actually used the lines on the page to get the bends to the correct angle to hold up the 7-segment display.  The build came together almost exactly how I envisioned it.  After I started testing the display I found that the LED segments were hard to see, so I put a sheet of [dark acrylic](https://www.tapplastics.com/product/plastics/cut_to_size_plastic/black_led_sheet/668) in front to cut the glare.
