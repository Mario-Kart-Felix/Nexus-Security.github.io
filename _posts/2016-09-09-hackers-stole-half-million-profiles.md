The hacker forums got a database of users of the portal jobinmoscow.ru. According to the founder and technical director of Device Lock, Ashot Hovhannisyan, the database has logins and passwords for 500,000 users in addition to the publicly available information.  
  
Media noted that some logins and passwords were relevant, if you enter some of them, you could get to the pages of portal users. After the journalist informed the site representative about this, it became impossible to enter the accounts.  
  
However, the company owning the site from which the leak occurred confirmed the information about the data leak.  
  
"A quick analysis of the situation showed that there are no violations of the law on our part. Our experts analyze any possible threats to the technical security of the site and take the necessary steps to prevent unauthorized use of the site," commented on the leak, Forex Consulting CEO Yuri Mozgovenko.  
  
Experts reported that the personal data of customers of the site can be used in the black market of fake employment. Scammers can call applicants and promise a job, but for the final stage of hiring, they will ask to pay a small amount.  
  
In addition, the leak of passwords creates a vulnerability for social networks of users, they can be hacked. Experts also note that the resume contains not only personal information about the applicant but also data about former employers. As a result of such a leak, it becomes possible to replace the resume or vacancies of a particular company to damage its business reputation.  
  
However, experts do not see significant threats in such data leaks.  
According to jobinmoscow.ru, more than 566,000 vacancies from 209,000 companies were posted, as well as more than 195,000 resumes.
