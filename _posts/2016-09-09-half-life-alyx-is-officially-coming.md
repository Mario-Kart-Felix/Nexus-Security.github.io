I have seven screenshots and a press release from Valve sitting in front of me. [I’ve had two days to process this](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20971514/valve-announces-half-life-alyx-its-first-flagship-vr-game). But I’m still in disbelief. Thirteen years after the most infamous cliffhanger in video game history, _Half-Life_ is finally coming back in March 2020 — as a VR game called _Half-Life: Alyx_.

  

Valve tells us it’s a VR-exclusive. And it’s a prequel of sorts, set between _Half-Life_ and _Half-Life 2_, in the days when Alyx Vance and her father Eli are building the resistance to the Combine’s alien occupation of Earth. You’ll play Alyx, and you’ll be wielding a way to manipulate gravity once more: the “Gravity Gloves,” which we can see Alyx using to pick up a pistol from a distance and interact with puzzles in the game’s first trailer — which you’ll find a little ways below.

Here’s Valve’s description of the kind of gameplay you should expect:

  

> Lean to aim around a broken wall and under a Barnacle to make an impossible shot. Rummage through shelves to find a healing syringe and some shotgun shells. Manipulate tools to hack alien interfaces. Toss a bottle through a window to distract an enemy. Rip a Headcrab off your face and throw it at a Combine soldier.

  

But if all these things make you think it’s just going to be another glorified tech demo for VR, you _might_ want to read Valve programmer David Speyrer’s answers to a few questions we asked:

  

**1)** “It’s not a side story, nor an episodic one — it’s the next part of the _Half-Life_ story, in a game around the same length as _Half-Life 2_.”

  

**2)** “While it does take place before the events of _Half-Life 2_, we actually recommend that you play through _Half-Life 2: Episode 2_ before you play _Half-Life: Alyx_, for reasons that will become clear as you progress.”

  

**3)** “Of course, we’ll have to wait and see how people react to _Half-Life: Alyx_ once it’s out, but we’d love to continue pushing forward.”

  

Not a tech demo. Not necessarily _just_ a prequel. And even if not in March, it sounds like there’s a chance us _Half-Life_ fans will finally get some closure.

  

Here’s the trailer:

  

  

I’ve watched it five times now, and it still makes me giddy.

  

Fifteen years ago, _Half-Life 2_ ended with a bang. One of the all-time greatest video game cliffhangers, it literally stopped time in the middle of an explosion, praised you for your work, then let the credits roll. In retrospect, it wasn’t so bad: we got to pick up right where we left a mere 18.5 months later with _Half-Life 2: Episode 1_.

  

Fingers crossed for closure

  

But we couldn’t say the same in 2007 when _Half-Life 2: Episode 2_ ended in tears — and then 12 years passed without Valve giving any indication we’d ever find out what happened to Gordon Freeman and Alyx.

Valve says you _will_ need a VR headset to play, because _Half-Life: Alyx_ is expressly designed for virtual reality. It won’t be coming to flat screens and traditional controls. But intriguingly, you _won’t_ need to buy the company’s own [Valve Index](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19102584/valve-index-steamvr-headset-review-shipping-today) — the company tells us the Oculus Rift, [the Oculus Quest with the new Link cable](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970865/oculus-link-beta-now-quest-rift-pc-nvidia-amd), the HTC Vive, even Windows Mixed Reality headsets should work.

  

Between nostalgia, the need for closure, and that multitude of choices, I wonder if this is the moment a few million extra gamers buy into VR.

  

There will be advantages to using the Valve Index’s VR controllers, though: Valve’s Bronwen Grimes [told _UploadVR_](https://uploadvr.com/valve-index-alyx-interactions/) that some “fun but not required” interactions like being able to crush a can in your hand won’t be available on other controllers.

  

Valve says you’ll be able to play it sitting or standing [with three different VR movement styles](https://www.half-life.com/en/alyx/vr) — the teleport mechanic where you aim a wand where you’d like to go, then appear there, an analog stick, or a “shift” mechanic that sounds intriguing.

Also, Valve says the game — built on its new Source 2 engine — will provide a set of tools for anyone to build their own new levels. “Hammer, Valve’s level authoring tool, has been updated with all of the game’s virtual reality gameplay tools and components,” the company writes.

While you may wind up needing a pretty beefy PC to play the game at its best, the minimum system requirements Valve is listing aren’t _that_ high: a Windows 10 computer with a Core i5-7500 or Ryzen 5 1600 or better, with a GTX 1060 or RX 580 graphics card or better. Those are high-end parts _if_ you haven’t upgraded in a few years. You’ll need 12GB of RAM, though, which may be an upgrade for many gamers who were told 8GB was enough.

  

_Half-Life: Alyx_ is [available for preorder today](https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/?snr=1_4_4__118) for $53.99 (normally $59.99; it’s on sale) **or free** to Valve Index owners. Valve is also offering some special bonuses (gun skins, Steam VR environments) to those who purchase Valve Index hardware by the end of the year.

If you’re anything like me, you won’t rest until you’ve consumed every scrap of information, so here’s exactly what Valve’s David Speyrer told us, as well as Valve’s official press release below.

  

**Is this a continuation of the events of** _**Half-Life 2: Episode 2**_**? Is this a full story on par with a major** _**Half-Life**_ **title or is it episodic?**

  

_Half-Life: Alyx_ is set in the aftermath of the Combine invasion of Earth, before the return of Gordon Freeman in _Half-Life 2_. While it does take place before the events of _Half-Life 2_, we actually recommend that you play through _Half-Life 2: Episode 2_ before you play _Half-Life: Alyx_, for reasons that will become clear as you progress. It’s not a side story, nor an episodic one — it’s the next part of the _Half-Life_ story, in a game around the same length as _Half-Life 2_.

  

**Does this mark a full return to the series? Should we expect more?**

  

Yes. It’s probably no surprise that many people at Valve have been wanting to get back to the _Half-Life_ universe for a long time, and this experience has only reinforced that. In the process of creating _Half-Life: Alyx_, we’ve had to explore new ways to tell stories with these characters and this world, and we’ve discovered a lot of new gameplay experiences that go beyond what we’ve been able to do before. Of course, we’ll have to wait and see how people react to _Half-Life: Alyx_ once it’s out, but we’d love to continue pushing forward.

  

**Will** _**Half-Life**_**’s return be exclusive to VR? To Steam VR? To Valve Index?**

  

_Half-Life: Alyx_ is exclusive to VR, but not to Valve Index. We continue to believe strongly in the open PC platform, and it is our intention that _Half-Life: Alyx_ is playable on any VR headset that connects to a gaming PC capable of running the game. If you have an HTC Vive, an Oculus Rift (or Quest with the Link cable), a Windows Mixed Reality headset — just to name a few — you can play _Half-Life: Alyx_. We put a lot of effort into making Valve Index the highest-fidelity VR solution on the market, and we think it’s a great way to play the game, but it’s absolutely not required.

If you want even more inside information — like how _Portal 2_ writers Erik Wolpaw and Jay Pinkerton are involved, and why it won’t be available for flat screens — game journalist Geoff Keighley [has shared 22 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9K0eJEmMEw&feature=youtu.be) of a roundtable interview with the team.
