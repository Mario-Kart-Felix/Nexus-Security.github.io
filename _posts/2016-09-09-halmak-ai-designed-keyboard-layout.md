====================================================================================

This is an AI designed keyboard layout that was built within the [keyboard-gentics](https://github.com/MadRabbit/keyboard-genetics) project. More details and a documented process can be found in [this blog](http://nikolay.rocks/categories/optimal+keyboard)

[](https://github.com/MadRabbit/halmak#features)Features
--------------------------------------------------------

*   Build based on the real world hand movements analysis
*   Nearly maximal possible typing efficiency
*   Very low overall fingers movement distance
*   Very low same finger / same hand usage overheads
*   Very low overall horizontal hands movement
*   Highly symmetrical design that accounts for individual fingers strength
*   Designed with the modern, web based English in mind

--------------------------------------------------------------

During the research I've identified the following results: in terms of efficiency

*   `QWERTY` - `0%` (base line)
*   `Dvorak` - `+77%`
*   `Colemak` - `+84%`
*   `Workman` - `+101%`
*   `Halmak` - `+134%`

Please refer to [this article](http://nikolay.rocks/2016-12-20-the-halmak-reborn) for the more detailed breakdown of the results.

All scripts are opensourced and can be verified in the [keyboard-gentics](https://github.com/MadRabbit/keyboard-genetics) repository.

--------------------------------------------------------

The name is a combination of `HAL-9000`, as a reference to the layout being designed by an AI. And, `Dvorak` as a gratitude to Mr. Dvorak for his dedication to the layouts optimizations process. The letter `m` in between is just to make it sound nicer. Or is it!?...

[](https://github.com/MadRabbit/halmak#installation)Installation
----------------------------------------------------------------

*   Git clone all the stuff somewhere
*   Copy `Halmak.bundle` into your `/Library/Keyboard Layouts` folder (create if it is missing)
*   Sign out, Sign in
*   Go to the keyboard preferences and add the `Halmak` layout
*   Ask here in issues if nothing works

There is an unofficial support module for the [TypeFu app](http://type-fu.com) that provides support for the `Halmak` layout:

Again, I'm not sure if there is a point to this. But I guess it's MIT.
