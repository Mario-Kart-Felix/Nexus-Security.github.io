X019, Microsoft's big event outlining the future of Xbox games, had several noteworthy announcements today. And Halo fans are getting a bit of a treat before year's end, because [Halo: Reach](https://www.gamespot.com/halo-reach/) is coming to Xbox Game Pass next month, rounding out the [Master Chief Collection](https://www.gamespot.com/the-master-chief-collection/). It'll be available on December 3 this year for Xbox One and PC (through Steam as well).

Halo: Reach first came out for Xbox 360 in 2010 and was the last Halo game from original series developer Bungie. It's a prequel that tells the story of Noble Team, a group of Spartans who gave it their all in the lead up to the beginning of the original game Halo: Combat Evolved. Reach is regarded as one of the high points for the franchise, and it's been upgraded visually for this generation with native 4K support. You can see footage of the PC version in action below:

Halo: Reach will be part of the Master Chief Collection for both Xbox One and PC. However, this is the first game in the gradual rollout of Halo titles through the Collection for PC specifically. For all our coverage on all the things new for Microsoft games and Xbox One, check out the news coming out of X019:
