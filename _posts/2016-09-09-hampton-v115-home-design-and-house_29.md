With an increased focus on India, Oppo decided to hold its first-ever software-focused event in New Delhi earlier this week. The Chinese company took the wraps off its new custom Android skin, [ColorOS 7](https://beebom.com/8-best-features-of-coloros-7/), at the launch event. ColorOS 7 not only introduces a minimalist UI, refreshed icons but brings a number of exciting new features in tow.  

Oppo claims that ColorOS 7 is not only their most significant update but will also be the [biggest software update rollout](https://twitter.com/colorosglobal/status/1199247997323759617) to date. The ColorOS 7 update will reach a total of more than 20 devices, covering almost all of their devices launched during the past couple of years – be it the flagship Reno series or the mid-range Oppo K3.
