At CES 2020, gaming peripheral provider HyperX announced a new line of products aimed at the PC market.

The first is the Cloud Flight S, a headset. It’s notable for being the first PC gaming headset to offer Qi wireless charging. Simply set the earcup on a compatible charging pad to charge up the cans. However, you won’t have to do this often, as the headset offers a solid 30 hours of battery life.

Another notable feature of this headset is its red LED indicator on the detachable microphone. This lets you know when you’ve muted the mic, allowing you to easily confirm that other can’t hear you. We appreciated this feature as well as the comfortable feel during our demo.

The Cloud Flight S will launch in February 2020 at a price of $159.99.

HyperX also unveiled the Alloy Origins mechanical gaming keyboard, which uses custom HyperX Aqua switches. This model contains all the standard features you’d expect from a gaming keyboard, including adjustable brightness and customizable lighting. Notably, you can also choose to tweak the lighting effects on a single key.

When we took a look at this keyboard, we were amazed at how stunning it looked. The keycaps are replaceable, allowing you to create a black-on-white or white-on-black look for your board. Expect to see the Allow Origins keyboard this March, arriving at a price of $109.99.

That’s not all we saw from HyperX at CES 2020. The company also showed off a new Pulsefire Raid mouse, which features 11 customizable buttons. Like other HyperX products, it interfaces with the HyperX NGENUITY software for user customization.

This mouse will be available shortly, in January 2020, and retails for $59.99.

Finally, the FURY Ultra mousepad includes a full 360-degree light ring and RGB light that you can customize as you wish. The pad has a hard surface with micro textures for comfortable mouse movement. Expect to see this in January 2020 for $54.99.

Overall, we’re happy with what HyperX had to show at CES. The company has a reputation for offering reputable products at a fair price, and these all look like fine additions to that lineup. Give these a try if you’re in the market for a new PC gaming peripheral.
