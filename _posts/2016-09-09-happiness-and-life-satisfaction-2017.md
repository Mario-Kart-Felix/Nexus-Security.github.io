1.  Particularly important was the [Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_on_the_Measurement_of_Economic_Performance_and_Social_Progress). It also relates to Bhutan’s famous measurement of Gross National Happiness (GNH) as indicator of progress (Wikipedia [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_national_happiness)).
    
2.  To be precise, in 27 out of 31 countries with data spanning longer than one decade, the estimate for 2016 is higher than the earliest available estimate.
    
3.  In some cases, the underlying data had multiple average estimates for the same territory (e.g. Baden and Württemberg were treated as different entities). In these cases the map shows the average between these two observations. Details can be found in [this file](https://ourworldindata.org/app/uploads/2017/04/Germany-happiness-data.xlsx)

Underlying data source: Life in Nation surveys, 1958–2007.

GDP per capita is at purchasing power parity in constant 2000 international dollars.”
