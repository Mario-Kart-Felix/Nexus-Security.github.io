On Saturday February 29, 2020 Raspberry Pi turns 8!! Or is it 2? This is an extra special year for our fav little computer because its a leap year.

All weekend long you can find [Raspberry Pi Jams](https://www.raspberrypi.org/jam/) across the globe. These are great places to learn, share and make with the Raspberry Pi. Download your own [Jam Guidebook](https://static.raspberrypi.org/files/jam/Raspberry-Jam-Guidebook-2017-04-26.pdf) here!

A great place to get started with the Raspberry Pi is the [Raspberry Pi Gift Guide](https://www.adafruit.com/explore/adafruit-holiday-gift-guide-raspberry-pi)

> On 29 February 2020, the Raspberry Pi Foundation will celebrate the eighth birthday of the Raspberry Pi computer (or its second birthday, depending on how strict you are about counting leap years).
> 
> Like any parent, we feel like time has flown by, and it’s remarkable to think how far we’ve come in such a short space of time.
> 
> Since launching the credit-card–sized $35 Raspberry Pi Model B, we have sold 30 million high-quality, low-cost computers worldwide. Raspberry Pi has become the third best-selling general-purpose computer ever, behind only the Mac and the PC.
