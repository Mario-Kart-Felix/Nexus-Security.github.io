Today marks the beginning of the year of the Rat. In New York rats often have a negative connotation but in the lunar zodiac the Rat signifies “wealth and surplus,” from [ChineseNewYear.net](https://chinesenewyear.net/zodiac/rat/)

> Rats are clever, quick thinkers; successful, but content with living a quiet and peaceful life.

Through the next couple of weeks the festival will be celebrated across the globe. If you are in the NYC area, there are a ton of ways you can participate.
