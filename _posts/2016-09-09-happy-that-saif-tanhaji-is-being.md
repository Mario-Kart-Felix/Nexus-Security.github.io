[Actress Kareena Kapoor Khan](https://www.instagram.com/therealkareenakapoor/?hl=en) is much excited about the success of '[Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanhaji)', that casts [Saif Ali Khan](https://twitter.com/search?q=Saif+Ali+Khan&ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Esearch) in a pivotal role.

  
"I am really excited. I am happy and thankful that the film is being appreciated by the audience," said Kareena, while interacting with the media at a meet-and-greet session she attended with Saif in Mumbai.

  

In 'Tanhaji', Saif plays Udaybhan Singh Rathore, the Rajput fort keeper in the regime of Jai Singh I who was loyal to the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. His performance too has been widely appreciated.

  
The film that opened on January 10 starring Ajay Devgn in the title role, made the makers smile all their way to the bank since its release.

  

Directed by Om Raut and co-produced by Ajay Devgn, the film based on the life of brave valiant Maratha warrior Tanaji Malusare, the military leader of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s army, also casts Kajol in the role of Tanhaji’s wife and Sharad Kelkar as Chhatrapati Shivaji.
