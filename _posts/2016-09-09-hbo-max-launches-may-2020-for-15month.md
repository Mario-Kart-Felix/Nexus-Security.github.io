Another day, another new media streaming service. This one courtesy of WarnerMedia. HBO Max is a streaming service offering the entire HBO service, plus original programming, and older content from the vaults. HBO Max is set to launch in May 2020.

From Cable Companies to Streaming Services
------------------------------------------

A decade ago, cable companies had consumers in their pockets. They could charge what they wanted, force bundles of unwanted channels on viewers, and generally take their customers for granted. Then Netflix arrived, and people started [cutting the cord](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/cut-that-cord-how-to-ditch-cable/) in droves.

Now, there are dozens of streaming services to choose from. All offering different movies and TV shows. The most recent additions being Apple TV+ and Disney+, which are priced at $4.99/month and $6.99/month, accordingly. And now HBO Max is joining the party.

Everything You Need to Know About HBO Max
-----------------------------------------

As revealed at a glossy launch event in Burbank, California, [HBO Max](https://www.hbomax.com/) is launching in the US in May 2020. It will initially be priced at $14.99/month. An ad-supported tier will follow in 2021, with WarnerMedia also looking to expand into Latin America and Europe.

At launch, HBO Max will offer “10,000 hours of curated premium content”. This includes existing HBO shows, new original series, and content from Warner Bros., New Line, DC, CNN, TNT, TBS, truTV, TCM, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, and more.

The price point of $14.99/month mirrors that of HBO Now, which seems fair enough. However, it means HBO Max will be more expensive than any other major streaming service, including Netflix, Hulu, Apple TV+, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video.

The caveat is that people already pay for HBO, so some of you will end up getting HBO Max for no extra charge. The exact details are yet to be confirmed, but existing HBO subscribers on AT&T plus HBO Now direct-billed customers should get HBO Max for free.

Are There Too Many Streaming Services?
--------------------------------------

WarnerMedia is keenly aware it’s entering a crowded market. So it’s trying to differentiate HBO Max from the competition. So, besides the usual downloads, profiles, and parental controls, HBO Max will offer human-curated content and a co-viewing feature.

Whether this all pays off remains to be seen, but HBO Max stands as good a chance as any of the other newcomers of securing a foothold in the sector. All we know is that [there are too many streaming services](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/too-many-streaming-tv-services/), and some will inevitably end up failing.
