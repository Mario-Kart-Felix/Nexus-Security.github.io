From Dr H on [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/Hearing-Jumping-Jack-Version-20/):

> The „Hearing Jumping Jack” is a simple electromechanical Jumping Jack, driven by two micro servos and a very simple gear, having LEDs as “eyes”. It is controlled by simple voice commands indicating which of nine predefined positions it shall take, or if the LED should be turned on or off, or if it shall perform a predefined “dance” or random set of moves.
