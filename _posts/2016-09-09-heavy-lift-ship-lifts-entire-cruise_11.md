In a 12-hour evolution on Saturday, the Boskalis semi-submersible heavy lift ship _BOKA Vanguard_ successfully floated the cruise ship _Carnival Vista_ aboard in order to facilitate repairs at a shipyard in the Bahamas. 

The _BOKA Vanguard_ is the largest vessel of her type, and she has enough capacity to lift and carry the 4,000 passenger _Carnival Vista_. The _Vista_ is experiencing technical difficulties with her azipods, and she needs to be drydocked in order to carry out the repairs. After the loss of Grand Bahama Shipyard's largest floating drydock in April, the nearest conventional solution for drydocking a vessel of _Vista's_ size would be overseas - but the _Vanguard_ could come right to the site. She will serve as a temporary drydock while repairs are carried out, and the _Vista_ will only be out of service for 17 days and three sailings. The cruise ship is expected to resume her normal schedule later in the month.
