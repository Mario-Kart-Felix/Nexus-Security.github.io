At its much-awaited hardware event held in Seattle, Amazon has not only upgraded its existing Echo smart speakers with new features but also expanded its portfolio with the launch of some pretty interesting new Echo device. The company went all out yet again, [announcing](https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-introduces-8-new-echo-devices) over a dozen new Echo and companion devices at the event.  

We not only got an Echo speaker with a clock but also a high-end Echo Studio speaker, along with a completely new lineup of Echo devices, i.e. smart wearables. Yes, Amazon announced its first-ever Alexa-powered Echo wearable too, so let’s not waste any more time and take a look at every new Echo device launched at Amazon’s hardware event –  

10 New Alexa-Powered Echo Devices
---------------------------------

Amazon says that users frequently use Alexa to inquire about what time it is, so they’ve updated the existing Echo Dot with **an** **LED display that now shows you the clock at all times**. This LED display sits below the fabric wrapped around the speaker and it can show you timers, alarms, and the temperature as well. You can tap the top of the smart speaker to snooze alarms up to 9 minutes.  

Echo Dot with Clock is now up for pre-order with a $59.99 price tag in the U.S and Rs. 5,499 in India.

Amazon states that listening to music is the most popular thing that smart speakers are used for, so the company has addressed this need in the best way possible with its new Echo Studio speaker. It’s a first-of-its-kind product that **delivers an immersive three-dimensional (3D) audio experience** using Dolby Atmos and Sony’s 360 Reality Audio technology. It automatically adjusts the sound experience based on the acoustics of the room – gunning for Sonos and Apple HomePod.  

> Amazon calls Echo Studio the most innovative speaker they’ve built to date.

  

Echo Studio is now up for pre-order and has been priced at $199.99 in the U.S. This huge speaker is coming to India and will retail at a steep Rs. 22,999 on Amazon India.

The new third-gen Echo smart speaker has the same form factor as its predecessor, but with an updated fabric design and audio architecture adopted from the Echo Plus, which means a 3-inch woofer and increased back volume for powerful bass.  

It offers you a slew of attractive color options including Twilight Blue, Charcoal, Heather Grey, and Sandstone. The third-gen Echo speaker is priced at $99.99 in the U.S and Rs. 9,999 in India, with pre-orders already live in both regions.  

![Amazon Echo Buds](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Untitled-design-1-2.jpg)

There’s already too much competition in the truly wireless earbuds segment, but Amazon now wants to **take on Apple Airpods and Galaxy Buds with its own Echo Buds**. The Echo Buds are a pair of Alexa-backed truly wireless earbuds, which features Bose’s Active Noise Reduction technology to provide a more focused and premium sound signature. It’s designed to provide you 5 hours of playback, which can be extended to 20 hours with the case.  

You can check out the complete details for Echo Buds, which are priced at $129.99, [right here](https://beebom.com/airpods-rival-echo-buds-launched/).  

![Amazon Echo Flex ](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Untitled-design-3.jpg)

This is probably my favorite among all the new devices launched at the event today. The Echo Flex plugs directly into a standard wall outlet to bring the power of Alexa all-around your household at an affordable $24.99 price tag. It houses a tiny speaker, far-field mics, two buttons up-front, an LED light, and a standard USB port so you can still charge your phone or connect accessories.  

![Amazon Echo Show 8](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Untitled-design-7.jpg)

  
  

  

Echo Show 8 can be called the middle child, sitting between the Echo Show 5 (which was [recently launched](https://beebom.com/amazon-echo-show-5-launched-india-price-availability-features/) in India) and Echo Show 10. There’s not a whole lot new things here to talk about, except for a bigger and versatile 8-inch HD display, powerful speakers, and a camera with privacy shutter.  

The new thing aboard Echo Show 8 is more content for users who have a smart speaker guiding them through recipes in the kitchen. A new integration with Food Network allows you can watch cooking shows from Bobby Flay, Giada de Laurentiis, and many others on this speaker. Echo Show 8 is now up for pre-order and will retail at $129.99 in the U.S.  

![Amazon Echo Glow](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Untitled-design-2-1.jpg)

Echo Glow is a multi-color smart lamp that pairs with Alexa and lets you cycle through different colors by tapping the orb-like device you see above. This is a new companion device that Amazon believes will be popular among kids, allowing them to have fun or completely go crazy with a flickering campfire light and dance party mode.  

Echo Glow will retail at $29.99 and is currently up for pre-order in the U.S. There’s no information of an India launch just yet.  

![Alexa Smart Oven](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Untitled-design-4.jpg)

After the Alexa Microwave, Amazon now plans to take over your kitchen with yet another Alexa-powered appliance. Called the Alexa Smart Oven, it is a $250 smart oven that you can control using voice commands. It’s up for pre-order in the U.S right now and you will get an Echo Dot with the oven.  

It can be used as a combination microwave, convection oven, air fryer, and food warmer. Alexa supports a number of presets for cooking common foods, along with the ability to **scan pre-packaged foods and let Alexa take over the cooking process**. It will load the instructions into the Alexa smart oven, reminding users to stir and announcing when the meal is cooked.  

Amazon Echo “Day1 Editions” Lineup
----------------------------------

  

Apart from the multitude of new Echo devices we’ve described above, Amazon has also stepped foot into the smart wearable segment with its _“Day 1 Editions”_ lineup. Now you must be wondering, why it’s called the Day1 Editions lineup? Well, it’s because all these new products aren’t ready for prime time, but Amazon wants users to try them out and provide feedback. These will be in limited quantities and be made available via an invite-only system.

  
  

  

And no, the company isn’t making smartwatches but even better, it has today launched Alexa-powered smart eyeglasses (not AR glasses) and an Alexa-powered smart ring. Do not believe me? Well, read on and find out for yourself –  

![](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Untitled-design-1-3.jpg)

The first wearable product from Amazon is Alexa-enabled eyeglasses – which you could convert into prescription glasses or sunglasses as well. They don’t feature a camera or display but instead, are very unintrusive – offering you access to Alexa on the move. It weighs just 31 grams, includes microphones and speakers (which keep Amazon’s voice assistant private to you but are still loud enough) on the sides.  

There’s a button to call upon Alexa, touch controls, and a light to indicate that Alexa is listening to you. Echo Frames will be **available at a special $179.99 price tag** and is compatible only with Android phones.  

![Amazon Echo Loop](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Untitled-design-2-2.jpg)

Well, **Alexa will literally be at your fingertips with the Echo Loop**. It’s yet another wearable from Amazon and it’s the coolest one among all the new products unveiled at today’s event. It has a button to activate Alexa, which you could then pose questions to and bring the ring up to your ear to see the assistant whisper the answer to you.  

You can also attend calls using this small Alexa-powered wearable, but it will run out of battery in no time. It has a 1-day battery life, with intermittent use over the course of a single day. It’s been priced at $129.99.  

Amazon Wants Alexa to Be Everywhere
-----------------------------------

  

Amazon’s hardware event shows that the company isn’t just satisfied with having a spot inside your home but also wants to be everywhere – even in person, on you, at all times. Amazon Echo devices have now expanded their presence and become even more handy, making it possible to do everything from asking questions to managing the smart home.
