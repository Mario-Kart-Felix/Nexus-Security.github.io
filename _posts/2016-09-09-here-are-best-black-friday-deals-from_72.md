Best Buy has shared its [Black Friday ad](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fblack-friday%2Fsale-ad), and one of the big surprises was that some of its best deals are already happening. Some of them are exclusive to My Best Buy members (Best Buy’s free membership service), but others are open to the general public.

The selection of deals is constantly changing, so we’ll be adding and removing products as savings surface or expire. Also, we’ve included a mix of deals that are happening now, as well as the rest of Best Buy’s Black Friday deals, which start on Thanksgiving Day, November 28th, at 5PM local time.

Computers and tablets
=====================

The [Surface Pro 7 (Intel Core i3, 4GB RAM, 128GB storage, with black Type Cover) will be $599 on Black Friday](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmicrosoft-surface-pro-7-12-3-touch-screen-intel-core-i3-4gb-memory-128gb-ssd-with-black-type-cover-latest-model-platinum%2F6374985.p%3FskuId%3D6374985). This silver-colored model typically costs $749 for the tablet alone, plus another $129 for the Type Cover. [According to Tom Warren’s review](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923662/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-tablet-specs-features-price-usb-c-windows-10), you can expect some minor but welcome improvements here, like a USB-C port for charging and a bump up to Intel’s 10th Gen processors across the board (including in this discounted model).

If you want an [upgraded version that has a faster processor and more RAM, that Surface Pro 7 model will cost $799](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmicrosoft-surface-pro-7-12-3-touch-screen-intel-core-i5-8gb-memory-128gb-ssd-with-black-type-cover-latest-model-platinum%2F6374987.p%3FskuId%3D6374987) on Black Friday.

[The HP Spectre x360 2-in-1 laptop (15.6-inch 4K display, 10th Gen Intel Core i7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) will be $1,099](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhp-spectre-x360-2-in-1-15-6-4k-ultra-hd-touch-screen-laptop-intel-core-i7-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-32gb-optane-dark-ash-silver-sandblasted-anodized-finish%2F6364582.p%3FskuId%3D6364582) (usually $1,599).

The 2018 iPad Pro is discounted ahead of Black Friday. The [11-inch iPad Pro with 64GB of storage is $649.99](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-11-inch-ipad-pro-latest-model-with-wi-fi-64gb-space-gray%2F5985628.p%3FskuId%3D5985628) ($150 off), which matches the best-ever price. The [12.9-inch entry model with 64GB of storage is $849.99](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-12-9-inch-ipad-pro-latest-model-with-wi-fi-64gb-space-gray%2F5985637.p%3FskuId%3D5985637), also a $150 discount. In fact, every storage or sizing configuration of the iPad Pro at Best Buy matches the best deals that we’ve seen, [so take a look](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fpromo%2Fipad-pro-member-savings).

On Thanksgiving, [the seventh-generation iPad (32GB) will be up to $100 off](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-ipad-latest-model-with-wi-fi-32gb-space-gray%2F5985609.p%3FskuId%3D5985609). This will likely be among the best prices out there for this model. ([Target will offer the same deal on Black Friday](https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/6/20951404/black-friday-target-deals-ipad-xbox-one-x-google-nest-gopro).) Compared to the previous generation iPad, this one has improvements like a Smart Connector port, a bigger screen, and an extra gigabyte of RAM, though the processor is the same.

[The latest MacBook Air will be $200 off starting on Thanksgiving](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fpromo%2Fmacbook-air-offer), starting at $899.99 for the base model with 128GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, and an Intel Core i5 dual-core processor.

Amazon’s Kindle Paperwhite e-reader with 8GB of storage will cost $84.99 (usually $129.99) on Black Friday.

[HP’s prebuilt Omen Obelisk desktop PC will be $899.99](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhp-omen-obelisk-intel-core-i7-9700-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1660-ti-1tb-hard-drive-256gb-ssd-shadow-black-front-bezel-dark-chrome-logo%2F6349466.p%3FskuId%3D6349466), down from $1,249. Inside of its case, you’ll find Intel’s i7-9700 CPU, 16GB of RAM, the Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti graphics card, a 1TB hard drive, and a 256GB SSD. The custom micro ATX case supports other motherboards if you decide to upgrade down the line, and, of course, you can swap the parts out as you please. But as it stands, this is a great value for all of these parts tossed into a well-built case.

The 15.6-inch MSI GS65 gaming laptop will be [$1,399.99](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmsi-15-6-gaming-laptop-intel-core-i7-32gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-2060-512gb-solid-state-drive-matte-black-with-gold-diamond-cut%2F6343975.p%3FskuId%3D6343975) (marked down from $1,899) and features a 240Hz 1080p display, Intel’s i7-9750H processor, 32GB of RAM, Nvidia’s RTX 2060 GPU, 512GB of PCIe storage, and a Thunderbolt port, among other features. Simply put, this is a fantastic deal that’s worth pursuing if you’re looking for a laptop that can outperform anything at this price range.

[Dell’s 17.3-inch G7 gaming laptop will be $1,099.99](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fdell-17-3-gaming-laptop-intel-core-i7-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-2060-1tb-hard-drive-256gb-ssd-abyss-gray%2F6350871.p%3FskuId%3D6350871) (usually $1,499), and it shares a lot in common with the MSI machine above. It has the same processor, graphics card, storage configuration, and Thunderbolt port. However, it’s much heavier, it has half the amount of RAM, and its display is locked at 60Hz. If those features don’t matter much to you, you can save $300 by purchasing this model.

Home entertainment
------------------

[Sonos Beam soundbar will be $319.99 (usually $399.99) and include a $20 Best Buy gift card](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsonos-beam-soundbar-with-voice-control-built-in-black%2F6253409.p%3FskuId%3D6253409). This soundbar is simple to set up, and it provides a big boost to your TV’s likely limited built-in speakers.

[Insignia’s 58-inch 4K HDR TV with Amazon Fire TV software built in will cost $199.99](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Finsignia-58-class-led-2160p-smart-4k-uhd-tv-with-hdr-fire-tv-edition%2F6355437.p%3FskuId%3D6355437) starting on Thanksgiving, and it will come with a free Amazon Echo Dot smart speaker.

[The Samsung 70-inch 4K HDR TV from its 6-series lineup will cost $549.99](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-70-class-led-6-series-2160p-smart-4k-uhd-tv-with-hdr%2F6363878.p%3FskuId%3D6363878) (usually $899.99). That’s a lot of TV for your money.

[LG’s 65-inch B9 OLED 4K HDR TV will be $1,799.99](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flg-65-class-oled-b9-series-2160p-smart-4k-uhd-tv-with-hdr%2F6360611.p%3FskuId%3D6360611) on Black Friday, discounted from $2,299.99. If you’re looking for the TV that will yield the best image quality for under $2,000, this is a good bet.

*   [Roku Streaming Stick+ 4K HDR streaming device will be $29.99](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Froku-streaming-stick-4k-streaming-media-player-with-voice-remote-with-tv-power-and-volume-black%2F5948005.p%3FskuId%3D5948005) (usually $49.99)

Gaming
------

The Microsoft [Xbox One X console will cost $349.99 (usually $499.99) and includes _Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order_](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-one-x-1tb-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-deluxe-edition-console-bundle%2F6350266.p%3FskuId%3D6350266) on Black Friday. The game alone costs $60, so getting it for free with the discounted console is a steal.

[Best Buy will sell the Nintendo Switch console for $299.99, and it will come with a free download code for _Mario Kart 8 Deluxe_ with purchase](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fnintendo-switch-with-mario-kart-8-deluxe-console-bundle-neon-blue-red%2F6302309.p%3FskuId%3D6302309). It’s important to note that the console looped into this deal is the launch model, not the newer version with improved battery life. But it’s no less capable at running games, and no less fun to play.

[Nintendo Joy-Con controller pairs (neon blue and red, or gray) will be $59.99](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fpromo%2Fshop-joy-con-controllers) (usually $79.99)

[The PS4 Slim console with 1TB of storage will be $199.99](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsony-playstation-4-1tb-only-on-playstation-console-bundle-jet-black%2F6380812.p%3FskuId%3D6380812) ($100 off) and include _The Last of Us: Remastered_, _God of War_,  and _Horizon: Zero Dawn_ with purchase. One of last year’s best deals was this model, but with a single game included.

Phones and wearables
--------------------

The [Apple Watch Series 4 is cheaper than ever](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fpromo%2Fapple-watch-s4). The 40mm version costs $299 (a $30 discount that appears to be exclusive to Best Buy, at least for now).

[If you’re looking for a discount on an iPhone 11 Pro, you can get one for $499 (roughly half off)](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fiphone%2Fshop-iphone-11-iphone-11-pro-and-iphone-11-pro-max%2Fpcmcat1568147641595.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1568147641595), but only if you activate a new line with Verizon, AT&T, or Sprint (and pay on an installment plan), and trade in your phone. A similar deal applies to the cheaper iPhone 11, too. Given its lower price, activating and trading in your old phone [will only set you back $199](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fpromo%2Fiphone-11) after your installment plan is up.

[Moto’s G7 will be $199.99](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmotorola-moto-g7-with-64gb-memory-cell-phone-unlocked-ceramic-black%2F6324277.p%3FskuId%3D6324277). This matches the best price that we’ve seen. If you’re on the hunt for an affordable, capable phone that’s good enough to top our list of best budget-friendly phones, this is your next phone.

[Samsung’s Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10 Plus will be $400 off after activation](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmobile-cell-phones%2Fmobile-phones-with-plans%2Fpcmcat209400050001.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat209400050001%26qp%3Dmodelfamily_facet%253DModel%2520Family~Samsung%2520Galaxy%2520Note10%255Emodelfamily_facet%253DModel%2520Family~Samsung%2520Galaxy%2520Note10%252B%255Emodelfamily_facet%253DModel%2520Family~Samsung%2520Galaxy%2520Note10%252B%25205G), or [$200 off unlocked for the Note 10 Plus](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-galaxy-note10-with-256gb-memory-cell-phone-unlocked-aura-glow%2F6359979.p%3FskuId%3D6359979) on Black Friday.

The [Google Pixel 4 will be up to $400 off on Black Friday](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flearn-about-google-pixel-4%2Fgoogle-pixel-4-shop-by-carrier%2Fpcmcat1570497903420.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1570497903420&subId1=xid:fr1573586392464hbh) for those who are activating a new line on Verizon, AT&T, or Sprint. If you’re looking for an unlocked Pixel 4 or Pixel 4 XL, you’ll be able to get $200 off starting on November 24th and ending on December 2nd. Either way, it’s a huge discount for a phone that released a handful of weeks ago.

[Google Pixel 3A will cost $299 unlocked,](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fpromo%2Funlocked-pixel-3a) saving you $100. Best Buy says that you’ll save an additional $50 if you activate it in the store.

Headphones
----------

[The Sony WH-1000X M3 over-ear, noise-canceling wireless headphones will be $279.99 (usually $349.99)](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsony-wh-1000xm3-wireless-noise-canceling-over-the-ear-headphones-with-google-assistant-black%2F6280544.p%3FskuId%3D6280544). These are among the best wireless headphones that you can buy, and they stand out from the competition with their masterful balance of comfort, sound quality, and excellent noise cancellation. This price matches the lowest that we’ve seen, and it may fall more as we get closer to Black Friday, but you’ll be getting a lot for your money whether or not you wait.

[Beats Studio 3 over-ear, noise-canceling wireless headphones will be $199.99](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fbeats-by-dr-dre-beats-studio-wireless-headphones-beats-skyline-collection-crystal-blue%2F6296113.p%3FskuId%3D6296113) (usually $349.99). This is the best price that we’ve seen, and the lowest that’s currently available for a new set of these cans. Like the Sonys above, these have active noise cancellation, but they feature Apple’s W1 wireless chip for fast, easy connection to other Apple devices, like your iPhone, iPad, or macOS computer. However, they charge via Micro USB, which might be their most glaring flaw compared to other flagship headphones.

[Jabra’s Elite 65t will go back down to $109.99](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fjabra-elite-65t-true-wireless-earbud-headphones-titanium-black%2F6181245.p%3FskuId%3D6181245) on Black Friday (usually $169.99), the most affordable price that we’ve seen. If you don’t want to pay upward of $150 for AirPods, or have an Android phone, these are worthy of your attention.
