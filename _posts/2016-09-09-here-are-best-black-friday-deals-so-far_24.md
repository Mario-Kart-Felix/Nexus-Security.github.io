Microsoft will offer several [Black Friday](https://www.theverge.com/black-friday) deals starting at 12AM ET on Thanksgiving Day, November 28th, though some of them are already happening below. One of the most notable inclusions of the sale is Microsoft’s [Surface Pro 7](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923662/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-tablet-specs-features-price-usb-c-windows-10). There are also a few Xbox-related deals on controllers and other accessories that you’ll probably want to hear about.

  

[The Surface Pro 7 (Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 128GB storage) will be bundled with a black Type Cover (usually sold separately) and sold for $799](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24542&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fplatinum-surface-pro-7-black-pro-type-cover-bundle-10th-gen-intel-core-i5%2F8tcpf5kwnkgw%3Fcid%3Dmsft_web_collection%26activetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab) starting on Friday, November 22nd. This model is usually priced at $899 for the tablet alone, and since the Type Cover is all but necessary, this is a great deal given how recently this product was released.

If you just want a Surface Pro 7 but don’t need the extra power brought along with the i5 processor and 8GB of RAM, the low-end option (i3, 4GB RAM, 128GB storage) is getting a $150 markdown starting on November 28th. Instead of $749, [it will cost $599 and will include a Type Cover](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&mid=24542&u1=verge&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fplatinum-surface-pro-7-black-pro-type-cover-bundle-10th-gen-intel-core-i3%2F8mc0j8c7rdrw%3Fcid%3Dmsft_web_collection%26activetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab).

The Microsoft Surface Go, its smallest Surface available, will be marked down by as much as $150 on November 28th. [The cheapest configuration (Intel 4415Y processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB storage) will be $299](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24542&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fsurface-go%2F8v9dp4lnknsz%3Ficid%3Dstore_bfreveal20_reveal_SurfaceGo_110119%26activetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab).

  

One of the better deals that Microsoft will offer is on a 15-inch HP laptop (model DY1771MS). [It will cost $499 starting on November 28th](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24542&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2FHP-Laptop-15-dy1771ms%2F9281R040R61N%3Ficid%3Dstore_bfreveal20_reveal_HPi7_110119%26activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab), and it seems like an especially great deal if you’re in need of a capable laptop that won’t cost you much. It has a 10th Gen Intel Core i7 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD. Beyond these capable specs, it’s a decent-looking machine for the price.

  

Starting on November 24th, [Microsoft will discount Xbox One wireless controllers by $20, making them $39](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24542&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fcollections%2Fxboxcontrollerssale%3Ficid%3Dstore_bfreveal20_reveal_xboxcontrollers_110119). We’re likely to see other retailers offering this deal, but Microsoft is offering a ton of different colors.
