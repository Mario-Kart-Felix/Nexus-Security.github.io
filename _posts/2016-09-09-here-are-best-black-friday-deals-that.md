Sam's Club, like every other major retailer, will be taking part in [Black Friday](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20951389/black-friday-deals-best-tech-gadgets-walmart-amazon-target-how-to-save) and Cyber Monday 2019. It recently released its [Black Friday ad](https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fcontent%2Fblack-friday-catalog&referrer=theverge.com), and all of its deals will switch on at 7AM local time on Friday, November 29th.

As far as what's sticking out right now, Sam's Club is back with the best-ever price on Vizio's P-Series Quantum TV that we've seen yet. Also, Google Nest Hubs come in a two-pack that will sell for $129, the usual price for just a single smart display.

We'll update this post with any new noteworthy Black Friday deals from Sam's Club that we stumble upon. Also, if there's a markedly better deal happening at a different retailer, we'll be sure to point you in the right direction.

Home entertainment
------------------

[Vizio's 65-inch P-Series Quantum X 4K HDR TV](https://fave.co/32zLQuE) (pictured above) will be $879. This is the best price we've seen yet for this high-end model, and it will be available online only. If you're shopping for a TV, Vizio's P-Series will be of interest if excellent picture quality, Apple AirPlay 2, and HomeKit support are must-have features for you. This TV is also very bright: it can reach a maximum of 3,000 nits, and it has 384 local dimming zones.

[LG's 82-inch 4K HDR TV (model 8070PUA) will be $1,599](https://fave.co/379ig1A). It usually costs $1,799, and this TV comes with a **$150 Sam's Club gift card**. This deal is available in-store and online, and it might be the best deal we'll find on such a big TV this holiday.

[Sonos' Beam soundbar will be $299](https://fave.co/32ToxLA), which is the best price that we've seen. Other retailers will offer it for $319.

Gaming
------

[The Xbox One S All-Digital console will cost $149](https://fave.co/2XitHiW) (usually $249). This is the discless version of the console, and the deal will be online and in-store.

[The PS4 Slim console bundle that includes _The Last of Us Remastered_, _God of War_, and _Horizon Zero Dawn_](https://fave.co/2KnTtxi) will be $199 (usually $299).

[Nintendo's Switch (the newer model with improved battery life) console includes several accessories and costs $334](https://fave.co/2KtfGtQ) (usually $389). This isn't a price cut, but it's a good deal if you want to gift the Switch with a bunch of accessories.

Misc.
-----

[Sam's Club will offer two Google Nest Hub smart displays for $129](https://fave.co/2QmzKBN). It's common that a single unit sells for $99, so getting two for just a little more is a steal.

[Bose SoundSport Pulse wireless headphones will cost $99.88](https://fave.co/2Kr1KAj), which is $30 off of its usual price.
