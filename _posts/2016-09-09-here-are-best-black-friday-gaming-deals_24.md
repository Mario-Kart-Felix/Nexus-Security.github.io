Doorbusters

*     
    _Call of Duty: Modern Warfare_ “C.O.D.E. Edition” will be $38 on [Xbox One](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24348&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-one%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fcall-of-duty-modern-warfare-c.o.d.e-edition--only-at-gamestop%2F10177937.html) and PS4 starting on Thanksgiving and lasting through Saturday, November 30th. This edition usually costs $59.99.
  
*     
    [Sony PlayStation 4 Pro will be $299.99](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24348&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-4%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-4-pro-glacier-white-1tb%2F10154139.html) (usually $399.99). This deal is happening at other retailers, but only at GameStop can you get the 4K-ready console in the “glacier white” color variant shown above. Plus, it comes with a $25 gift card.
  
*   GameStop is, so far, the only retailer to offer any sort of notable [deal on the Nintendo Switch Lite](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24348&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fswitch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-lite-gray%2F11095774.html), the smaller, portable version of the Switch. Its price will remain $199.99, but it will come with a $25 gift card. (This deal will only be available on the Saturday and Sunday after Black Friday.)

*   If you’re looking for an affordable way to pick up an Xbox One (the bigger, original version pictured above to the left) and don’t mind that it’s preowned and refurbished, [GameStop will be selling them for just $99.99 on Black Friday](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24348&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-one%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-one-500gb-console---black-gamestop-premium-refurbished%2F10116367.html). It might not be able to play 4K Blu-ray discs, but it’s perfectly good at everything else that the slimmed-down Xbox One S can do. If nothing else, it’s a cheap way to get a system that’s able to access Xbox Game Pass.
  
*   The Xbox One X will be $150 off of its retail price, and [GameStop will offer the console with its exclusive speckled design](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24348&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-one%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-one-x-nba-2k20-special-edition-1tb-bundle-only-at-gamestop%2F11095798.html) (the best design, in my humble opinion) bundled with _NBA 2K20_ for $349.99.
  
*   A few other exclusive deals happening at GameStop may, or may not, make a dent in your (or a loved one’s) wishlist. Nevertheless, it’s worth noting that _The Division 2_ ([PS4](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24348&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-4%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Ftom-clancys-the-division-2%2F10167228.html), [Xbox One](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24348&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-one%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Ftom-clancys-the-division-2%2F10167230.html)) will be available for $12 and _Anthem_ ([PS4](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24348&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-4%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fanthem%2F10164248.html), [Xbox One](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24348&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-one%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fanthem%2F10164252.html)) for $5.
  

The non-doorbusters are good, too

*   Sony’s PS4 Slim console will be $199.99 ($100 off its usual price), and comes bundled with _God of War_, _Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition_, and _The Last of Us Remastered_. This deal is available at almost every major retailer.
  
*   The [Xbox One S 1TB console will be bundled with _Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order_ for $199.99](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24348&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-one%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-one-s-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-bundle-1tb%2F11097481.html) (usually $299.99). Additionally, the [All-Digital version of the console will be $149.99](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24348&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-one%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-one-s-all-digital-edition-1tb%2F11097118.html) (usually $249.99).

*   Nintendo Switch (the original launch version without the battery performance gains of the latest iteration) will be paired with _Mario Kart 8 Deluxe_ included for $299.99. It will come with a free $25 gift card. This bundle will also be available at Best Buy, Walmart, and Target, but the gift card offer is exclusive to GameStop. (This deal is active only on Thanksgiving and Black Friday.)
  
*     
    [PS4 controllers will be $38.99](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24348&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-4%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fproducts%2Fsony-dualshock-4-black-wireless-controller%2F10136481.html) at GameStop; that’s about $21 off of the retail price and $1 cheaper than other retailers.
  
*     
    _Red Dead Redemption 2_ ([PS4](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24348&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-4%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fred-dead-redemption-2%2F10138091.html), [Xbox One](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24348&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-one%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fred-dead-redemption-2%2F10138093.html)) will be $29.99 at GameStop. This matches Walmart’s Black Friday price.
  
*     
    _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_ ([Switch](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24348&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fswitch%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild%2F10141904.html)) will be $39.99 at GameStop. Target and Walmart will have it for $10 less, but if they sell out, this is a good route to save some money.
