It's tough to keep track of all the gaming deals that will kick off on Black Friday. That's sort of a good problem to have; it means that there's no shortage of deals on consoles, games, and accessories for the Nintendo Switch, Sony PlayStation 4, and the Xbox One X and S. We'll add PC deals as they become available, as well.

We're tracking all the deals that we know about below by platform, so you can easily find the best deal on exactly what you're looking for over the holidays. We'll be updating this post, both to add new deals and strike through outdated offers.

Deals on Xbox One consoles, games, and accessories
--------------------------------------------------

Microsoft's 4K-ready Xbox One X will be $349 at several retailers, a $150 discount that amounts to the biggest drop in price we've seen yet for this console. Better yet, you might be able to find a game or two (or a controller) tossed in as a freebie with your purchase.

**Here's the best deal**: the Xbox One X console comes bundled with _Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order_ for $349 at [Best Buy](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-one-x-1tb-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-deluxe-edition-console-bundle%2F6350266.p%3FskuId%3D6350266&subId1=xid:fr1573760975205heb) and [Walmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-One-X-1TB-Star-Wars-Jedi-Fallen-Order-Black-CYV-00411%2F930618304) starting on Thanksgiving.

Deals on Nintendo Switch consoles, games, and accessories
---------------------------------------------------------

During Black Friday 2019, you won't find deals on the new Nintendo Switch Lite, or the revised Switch with improved battery life. That leaves us with the original launch version of the console, which is what you'll get with this holiday's bundle.

The Nintendo Switch costs $299 and includes _Mario Kart 8 Deluxe_ with purchase at [Best Buy](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fnintendo-switch-with-mario-kart-8-deluxe-console-bundle-neon-blue-red%2F6302309.p%3FskuId%3D6302309&subId1=xid:fr1573760975205ige), [Target](https://fave.co/36F3j7n), [Walmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F391444954&subId1=xid:fr1573760860204iac).
