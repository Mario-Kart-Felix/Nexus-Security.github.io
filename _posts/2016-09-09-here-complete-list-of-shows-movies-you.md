Months after the [official announcement](https://beebom.com/apple-tv-plus-launch/) earlier in March, Apple TV+ finally went live on November 1 to lock horns with video streaming bigwigs such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and others. The video streaming service has set the subscription prices at $4.99/ month in U.S and Rs 99/month in India, which are pretty attractive prices but are you wondering what all TV shows and movies can you watch on Apple TV+?  

Well, Apple TV+ stands out of the crowd by providing subscribers access to original TV shows, movies, documentaries, and more. The Cupertino giant is **placing its bets on original programming** in comparison to its competitors, who are throwing money to attain rights to stream popular sitcoms like Friends, Seinfeld, and others.  

So, if you have been wondering what all TV shows and movies you can stream on Apple TV+ right now, then read on. Here’s a quick look at the shows available to stream right away:  

List of TV Shows and Movies on Apple TV+
----------------------------------------

  

### 1\. The Morning Show

  

Apple has been using the star-studded “The Morning Show” to market Apple TV+ ever since its announcement. While the name suggests it’s a morning talk show, it’s not. It, however, is a drama TV series starring Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and Billy Crudup and gives us a look at the lives of people who wake up early and deliver us the latest news on TV.  

The Morning Show premiered with a single episode, with new episodes scheduled to be released every Friday, and I would love to see how the story progresses.

### 2\. Dickinson

  

Dickinson is a comedy-drama that revolves around Emily Dickinson _(played by Hailee Steinfeld)_, the famous American poet as she explores the many social issues, gender boundaries, and struggles to get her work published in a patriarchal society. The show hasn’t exactly garnered rave reviews from critics, but it will appeal to millennials since Dickinson’s life has been portrayed as a feisty and rebellious teenager.

The show could be your gateway to NASA and how it operated back in the day and well, the reviews are not half bad.
