While the recently-announced [Diablo IV](https://www.gamespot.com/diablo-iv/) is [not coming out anytime soon](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-release-date-is-far-off-blizzard-says/1100-6471134/), Blizzard confirmed that a planned February 2020 update will show a behind-the-scenes look at the progress being made on the game. Before then, we'll be getting some new information and clarifications in the near future.

Game director Luis Barriga [announced Blizzard's intention](https://us.diablo3.com/en/blog/23220969/a-letter-from-our-game-director-blizzcon-2019-11-13-2019) to release "a series of quarterly updates," with one planned for this coming February as the first to kick the series off. Barriga didn't clarify what these updates will contain but said the studio is "excited about \[the\] cool update" for February.

Alongside these quarterly announcements, Barriga also said that Blizzard's lead systems designer, David Kim, will provide updates of his own "in the coming weeks." Kim will provide information on items and stats, as well as "address some of your open questions" in various online channels.

Blizzard added some new features to Diablo IV, including [mounts](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-mounts-revealed-at-blizzcon-2019/1100-6471102/) to make travel faster. [A big feature](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-aiming-to-be-more-replayable-thanks-to/1100-6471324/) that was supposed to be in [Diablo III](https://www.gamespot.com/diablo-iii/), player-versus-player, has made its way to Diablo IV. In [a hands-on preview](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-feels-like-a-demonic-destiny-thanks-to-it/1100-6471114/), we said that it seems "Diablo IV \[may\] offer a pretty different take on the franchise from its predecessor."

Diablo IV was [announced at BlizzCon 2019](https://www.gamespot.com/g00/articles/diablo-4-announced-at-blizzcon-with-gameplay-and-c/1100-6471089/?i10c.ua=4&i10c.encReferrer=&i10c.dv=3/), though the action-RPG was [leaked prior to Blizzard's annual event](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2019-rumors-and-leaks-diablo-4-and-overwa/1100-6470719/). The studio has since shown off [the game's three current classes](https://www.gamespot.com/g00/articles/diablo-4-druid-barbarian-and-sorceress-featured-in/1100-6471090/?i10c.ua=4&i10c.encReferrer=&i10c.dv=3/), announced that [all versions are online-only](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-doesnt-have-an-offline-mode-all-versions-/1100-6471115/), and confirmed plans to [include cosmetic microtransactions](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-planning-on-offering-cosmetic-microtra/1100-6471337/).
