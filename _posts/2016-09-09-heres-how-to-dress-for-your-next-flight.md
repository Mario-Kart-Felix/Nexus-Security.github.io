When it comes to in-flight fashion, comfort and practicality should always be a priority. To maximize your experience at 35,000 feet in the air, here are some clothing tips you should consider next time you plan your mile-high outfit.

What to Wear
------------

The air is dry, the pressure is high, and the temperature is low. Spending hours stuck in a flying tin can isn’t the most exciting experience, especially if you’re flying Economy. Bringing these items of clothing with you should help you feel cozy and increase your chances of falling asleep until you land.

Layers
------

Whether you’re flying to a warmer or colder location, it’s good to wear an outfit that will help you ease into the transition. However, while your mind might just be set on your destination, you should always keep in mind that the temperature in an airplane is never really toasty. That’s when layering comes in handy.

Be it a hoodie, a cardigan, or a cashmere sweater, having that extra layer with you can save you and your neighbor from the constant sound of your chattering teeth and bump the cozy level up a notch. Simply pack it in your carry-on and grab it the moment your body temperature begins to drop. Not only is dressing in layers great for general comfort, but it makes it a lot easier to [catch a solid nap during the flight](https://www.lifesavvy.com/3493/how-to-sleep-comfortably-on-an-airplane/).

Compression Socks
-----------------

You’re probably heard about the downside of long-haul flights before. Aside from the dry air that deprives your skin of its natural moisture, there’s the issue of lack of movement and impaired blood circulation on your lower limbs. Informally known as the “Economy Class Syndrome,” deep vein thrombosis is a real issue that can affect anyone on or after a long flight. Sitting for an extended period on your small airplane seat can cause swelling on your legs and feet due to poor circulation, increasing your chances of developing a blood clot that can travel to your lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism which can sometimes be fatal.

Compression socks add the necessary pressure to assist your circulation and keep the swelling away. They might not be the most fashionable item, but they’ll save you from the discomfort of dealing with big feet in tight shoes.

Scarf
-----

We’ve mentioned how cold it can get on the plane and how wearing minimal clothing won’t do it any good. If you’re not a fan of sweaters or hoodies, you can opt for a scarf that can keep you warm while also helping your outfit look more put together. Sometimes airlines don’t provide blankets so if you have a scarf you can quickly wrap it around you and feel like a snug and peaceful burrito. Plus, they take very little space, and you can even use them to cover your hair or shoulders if you’re flying to a country with a conservative dress code.

Tote or Weekender Bag
---------------------

When a carry-on is not necessary, either because you managed to fit everything in your suitcase or because you’d rather stick to carrying one wheeled bag at a time, you should consider opting for a bag that you can even fit under the seat in front of you. This way, if you need your earplugs or your sweater when the lights are out, and everyone else is sleeping, you can quickly get to them by reaching for your bag under the seat or in the overhead compartment undisturbed. If you decide on a tote bag, make sure it has a zipper or button closure to keep your belongings secure at all times.

What to Avoid
