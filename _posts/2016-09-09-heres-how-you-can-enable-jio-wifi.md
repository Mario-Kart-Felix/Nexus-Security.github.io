The list of compatible list of devices is huge compared to Airtel, but OnePlus smartphones are not included in the list yet. But, there's a workaround on getting Jio VoWiFi on your OnePlus smartphone, and in this post, we will show you the steps to get Jio Wi-Fi calling on your OnePlus smartphone. Note: We tested on OnePlus 7T, 7T Pro and OnePlus 6 smartphones and it worked as expected. It is not working on OnePlus 6T, as of now.  \[gallery link="file" size="large" ids="302194,302193,302192"\] Steps to enable Jio VoWiFi on OnePlus smartphones Download and install OnePlusLogKit 1.0 APK \[Download Link\] Open Dialer and dial \*#800# You'll get a warning, but click 'Enter' Then, go to oneplus Log Kit->Function Switch->VoWifi switch and enable the same Reboot your device Lastly, navigate to Settings->Wi-Fi & internet->SIM & network->SIM (Jio 4G)->Enhanced Communications->Turn on Wi-Fi Calling WiFi Calling will start working and you will see the 'VoWiFi' icon on the status bar It is to be noted that the Function Switch on the LogKit is a Dev test only, and the functionality might be unstable after enabling. Hopefully, Jio and OnePlus will enable this feature ...
