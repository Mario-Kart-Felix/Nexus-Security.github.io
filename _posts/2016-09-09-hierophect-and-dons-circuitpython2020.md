Lucian (@Hierophect) and his buddy Don wrote an awesome #CircuitPython2020 [blog post together](http://howtobuildathing.com/2020/01/12/hierophects-circuitpython-2020/). Read it to find out more about CircuitPython around the world doing data monitoring and Lucian’s time so far as a core CircuitPython dev. Here is a sneak peek from Lucian:

> Like I said before, I’m excited by how these projects spread good past the education phase. I think teaching people new skills is an intrinsic good on its own, but the prospect of Circuitpython helping scientists to diagnose our oceans and farmers to better understand their crop cycles seems like a whole new level of impact to me. In 2020 I hope we can do more to recognize and encourage this kind of Circuitpython use, and I hope to help add new features that better support these kinds of projects.

And one from Don as well:

> Researchers and farmers who have been exposed to the world of inexpensive, open source hobby electronics — with its wide range of easily-interfaced devices, connectivity options, and flexible data formats — are amazed by the capabilities they see. But as Lucian says, even the relatively accessible Arduino platform can be intimidating to novices, with the consequence that adoption and development of open source hardware in environmental monitoring applications seems slower than it ought to be. That’s why the \*truly\* beginner-friendly approach taken by CircuitPython recently has been such an exciting development for me: there is finally a platform that I can unhesitatingly recommend to farmers, hydrologists, agronomists, and resource managers.
