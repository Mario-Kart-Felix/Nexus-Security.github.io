After Google officially [announced Android 10 Go Edition](https://beebom.com/android-10-go-edition-announced/), aimed at entry-level smartphones with low-end specs and low storage, HMD Global has today announced that the Android 10 Go edition update will be coming to at least three of its entry-level Android smartphones.  

The announcement was made on Twitter by HMD Global’s Chief Product Officer, Juho Sarvikas, who in a tweet, said _“Entry level smartphone experience should not be a compromise. #Google proves it with new #Android 10 Go edition offering rich experiences with even better memory mgmt, performance & security. We are working to bring them first on #Nokia smartphones”._  

According to an accompanying image (which you can see above) posted by Sarvikas, the Nokia 1 Plus will be getting the update to Android 10 Go edition sometime in Q1 2020, while the Nokia 2, and the Nokia 1 will be getting the Android 10 Go update in Q2 2020.  

That might not seem like it’s close enough, but for entry-level phones, this is a pretty great update roadmap, and according to Sarvikas’ tweet, Nokia might well be the first company to roll out Android 10 Go edition updates to its phones.  

With Android 10 Go edition, Google says it has improved performance and speed, while still maintaining the light-weight experience that Android’s Go edition is known for. We’ll have to wait and see whether HMD Global will be able to stick with this schedule, and if it does, it’s definitely going to be pretty great for users who are using these Nokia entry-level smartphones.
