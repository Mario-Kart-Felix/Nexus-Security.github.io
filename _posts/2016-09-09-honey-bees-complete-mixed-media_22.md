> Artist [Ava Roth](http://www.avaroth.ca/) loves working on collaborative projects. But her studiomates aren’t fellow two-footed friends. Rather, Roth pairs with her backyard honeybees to create mixed media collages combining embroidery, beadwork, fabric, tree bark, and honeycomb. The Toronto-based artist builds artworks inside the comb frames, and the bees complete the pieces by encasing them in organic honeycomb patterns. “This project is a collaboration in the truest sense. It involves careful listening, respecting the bees, and cooperating with them entirely, from the choice of materials, size, timing and scope of design,” Roth tells Colossal. “My intention is to celebrate the extraordinary work of the honeybee and match it with sewings that invoke their delicate and ephemeral comb.”

> The artist explains that she had been working in [encaustic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encaustic_painting), a painting technique that incorporates wax, for several years, and decided to start collaborating with her bees as she learned more about [Colony Collapse Disorder](https://www.epa.gov/pollinator-protection/colony-collapse-disorder) and sought to uplift and honor the bee’s work.
