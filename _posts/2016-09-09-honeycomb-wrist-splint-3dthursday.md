> MaJaDev’s wrist splint + valba’s honeycomb to make a pattern that prints predictably without worrying about infill settings.
> 
> Splint thickness and honeycomb mesh size customizable in openscad file. Included stls with 2.5 mm (beefy enough for me!) and 4 mm thick splint.
> 
> I still don’t like how the connecting bit between the thumb and first finger feels, changes to come….

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
