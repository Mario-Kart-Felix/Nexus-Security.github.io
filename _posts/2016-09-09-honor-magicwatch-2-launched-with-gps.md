At its [Honor V30 launch event](https://beebom.com/honor-v30-launched-in-china-with-5g-support-triple-cameras/) earlier today, Huawei’s Honor sub-brand unveiled a new mid-range smartwatch in China. Called the **Honor MagicWatch 2**, the device is an upgrade over the first-gen Honor Watch Magic (yes, with a slightly changed name) that was launched earlier this year by the Chinese tech giant.
