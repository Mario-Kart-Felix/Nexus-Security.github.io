Huawei sub-brand Honor has today launched the Honor V30 series of smartphones in China. The Honor V30 and the Honor V30 Pro are very similar in a lot of ways, but there are subtle differences.  

Both the Honor V30 and Honor V30 Pro come with 6.57-inch FullHD+ display, and thereâ€™s a dual-punch-hole camera on the front, on both the smartphones, packing in a 32MP + 8MP ultra-wide selfie shooter.  

Under the hood, the phones run the Kirin 990 SoC and come with an integrated 5G modem, and also come with support for NSA/SA 5G, and 4G+5G dual-sim capabilities. Paired with this Kirin 990 SoC, the Honor V30 gets 6GB/128GB and 8GB/128GB memory and storage variants. The Honor V30 Pro, on the other hand comes in 8GB/128GB and 8GB/256GB variants. Both the phones run Android 10-based EMUI.
