The teaser also confirms dual punch-hole screen with minimal bezels. It will come with 5G with support for both SA and NSA dual mode 5G. Based on earlier rumors the HONOR V30 is said to feature an LCD punch-hole screen, pack 60MP triple rear cameras, which could use new Sony IMX686 sensor and a 4000mAh battery with support for 22.5W fast charging. The HONOR V30 Pro is said to feature OLED screen, powered by Kirin 990 5G SoC, pack 60MP quad rear cameras and a 4200mAh battery with support for 40W super fast charging and 15W wireless fast charging. We should know more details about the phone once it gets certified by TENAA later this month. Source
