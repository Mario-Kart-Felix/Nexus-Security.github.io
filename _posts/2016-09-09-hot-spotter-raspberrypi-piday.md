> The ‘Hot Spotter’ is an autonomous drone capable of discovering smoldering fires and reporting their location. The drone achieves this by creating a heat map which it generates in realtime by combining the data from a thermal sensor ([MLX90614ESF-BCC](https://www.melexis.com/en/documents/documentation/datasheets/datasheet-mlx90614)), distance sensor (LIDAR-Lite V3), position sensor (GPS), and the orientation of the drone (attitude telemetry via MAVLink).
