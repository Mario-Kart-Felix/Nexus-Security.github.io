Research at the Babraham Institute uniting cell signalling, autophagy, mass spectrometry and imaging expertise has resolved a fundamental question about whether the cellular recycling process is halted during cell division. In addition, the researchers have identified the mechanisms involved and described how the usual repression system and the mitosis-specific repression of autophagy interlink. The research, led by Simon Cook's group in the Signalling research programme at the Institute, is published today in the journal Molecular Cell.
