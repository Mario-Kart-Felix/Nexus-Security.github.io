How do you Shazam stuff? It’s spectrogram magic. From [Audio Melody](http://www.audiomelody.com/news/how-do-music-recognition-apps-work/):

> Basically it works like this. The database [stores song data](https://www.maketecheasier.com/how-music-identification-apps-work/) about the song’s unique sounds and patterns. Then the app listens to the music, creating an audio fingerprint based on a few seconds of the track. This data is the checked against the database, which matches it to your recording.
> 
> This begins with a spectrogram, essentially a graph that has time on the x-axis and frequencies on the y-axis, and amplitude is represented by color. Any sequence of sound can be converted into a spectrogram and there can be an assigned set of coordinates attached to it at any time. Notes turn into numbers. Looking through a database of millions of songs using a detailed spectrogram, there too many data points to look through at any speed.
