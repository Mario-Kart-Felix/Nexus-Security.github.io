At ICSE 2020, an interesting paper is being presented on **How do you Architect your Robots? State of the Practice and Guidelines for ROS-based Systems**.

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is the de-facto standard for robotic software. ROS was developed in 2007 as the development environment for the Willow Garage PR2 robot, but has proven useful for a wide variety of robots.

The paper presents an observational study aimed at (i) unveiling the state-of-the-practice for architecting ROS-based systems and (ii) providing guidance to roboticists about how to properly architect ROS-based systems.

As robots become important in more facets of our world, and their tasks become more complex, engineering their software to meet quality requirements such as safety and reliability becomes more critical.
