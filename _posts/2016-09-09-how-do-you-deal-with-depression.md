I eat a good steak. I'm not kidding or trivializing. But if I get busy and I'm always stressed out maybe trying to cut calories, after I while my mood gets dark. Sometimes, I have found its not just stress. I just need a good steak or burger. My metabolism does NOT liking going more than a few weeks without a serious protein hit. And it needn't be an unhealthy frequency or amount.

So YMMV, but sometimes a big part of metal health can be adjusting what you eat and drink.
