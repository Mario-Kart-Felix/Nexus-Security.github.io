[Liz Clark](https://www.twitter.com/BlitzCityDIY), AKA [BlitzCityDIY](https://www.instagram.com/BlitzCityDIY), recently worked on the code for a camera slider build. She published a video on her [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbAUKL7V6OOGumQEeDMYQvQ), check it out!

> had the great opportunity to contribute the CircuitPython code for this update to Adafruit’s DIY Camera Slider project. I’ve actually always had this project on my list to make since it was published so to be able to update it with Noe was really awesome. It’s easily one of the most practical projects I’ve ever worked on and I definitely recommend it for anyone who uses timelapses in their video production. In this video I focus on the code writing process and how to approach writing code from scratch. Check out the Learn Guide for all the assembly instructions and links to download the .STL files.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!

The [Adafruit Learning System](http://learn.adafruit.com) has dozens of great tools to get you well on your way to creating incredible works of engineering, interactive art, and design with your 3D printer! If you’ve made a cool project that combines 3D printing and electronics, be sure to let us know, and we’ll [feature](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) it here!
