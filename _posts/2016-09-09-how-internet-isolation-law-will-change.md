On November 1, the law on the isolation of the Runet came into force. Some companies spend millions to switch to Russian servers and local social networks, while others completely shut down business in the country.  
  
The Runet isolation will affect all Russian business, but only Telecom operators must install special equipment to monitor cyber threats at the state’s expense. The State financed about 30 billion rubles ($ 460 000 000) for its execution.  
  
According to Alexandra Kurdyumova, senior partner at Versus.legal law firm, we are talking about devices and software that works on the principle of DPI (deep packet inspection). The technology monitors not only where the traffic is going, but also analyzes its contents.  
  
"If something seems suspicious to Roskomnadzor, it will be able to disable the malicious resource without the participation of Telecom operators," explains Kurdyumova.  
  
New features of the regulator alerted the entire network business. If the company's website runs on a foreign server (for example, Amazon), uses Google Analytics for data analysis or conducts sales via Instagram or other foreign social networks, it risks losing access to usual tools, if Roskomnadzor wants it.  
  
“I see a lot of risks in the law on the isolation of the Runet. Therefore, within six months we will transport employees to the United States and Poland. About 10% of employees will remain in Russia so far to support current customers”, said Roman Kumar Vyas, founder of the marketing Agency Qmarketing and co-owner of the cleaning service Qlean.  
  
According to Albert Oskanov, co-founder and CEO of Oskelly clothing marketplace, the authors of the bill do not quite understand what they are going to do, do not realize the consequences. Their actions can lead to serious disruptions in the work of some Russian companies.  
  
Sergey Demin, IT Director of IT outsourcing company G-Support, believes that the centralization of the network infrastructure does not make it more stable, but bites it. A very easy target appears for hackers. As a result, users will migrate to the Darknet and there will be constant attacks on the IT infrastructure of regulatory authorities.
