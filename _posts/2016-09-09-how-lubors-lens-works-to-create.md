In this video on [NightHawkInLight](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFtc3XdXgLFwhlDajMGK69w), Ben demonstrates how a Lubor’s lens works. This is a type of [Fresnel lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_lens) that takes the light coming into it from the back at obtuse angles and projects it forward in the front of the lens. This re-directing of lightwaves causes what is on either side of the lens to appear as those it is directly behind the lens, effectively making what’s actually behind the lens to seemingly disappear.
