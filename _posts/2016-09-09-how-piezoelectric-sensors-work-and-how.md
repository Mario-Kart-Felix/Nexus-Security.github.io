The [How to Get What You Want site](http://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?p=7943) presents another interesting tutorial on piezoresistive sensors, various techniques to lay them out, and how to interface them to microcontrollers.

> In this post I want to try and explain how a pressure matrix built from conductive rows and columns with a piezoresistive material (Eeonyx, [velostat](http://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?p=381)) in between works, how to wire it up to a microcontroller and write the Arduino code that will parse through the rows and columns to read the individual pressure points at each row/column intersection.

> 3) the matrix code

The article uses some excellent Flickr drawings to illustrate piezoelectric properties.

And how sensors may be woven to form a matrix
