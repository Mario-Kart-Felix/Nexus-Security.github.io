As barely a few hours of 2019 are left, I felt a tad nostalgic remembering all the amazing moments that graced my life. Songs being an integral part of my life, I felt to turn the clock back and see what tracks were able to mesmerize me the most. While Apple has offered a pretty nice way to [get the top 100 songs of the year for Apple Music users](https://beebom.com/apple-music-replay-playlist-feature/), I wanted the list to be a bit more precise – somewhere around 20-25. And much to my bliss, there is a straightforward way to access the top 25 most played songs in Apple Music on iPhone and iPad. If you also have the same craving, this short piece is for you.
