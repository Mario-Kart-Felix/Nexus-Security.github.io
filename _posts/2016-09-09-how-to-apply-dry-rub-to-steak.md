A dry rub is a combination of salt, pepper, sugar, herbs and spices used to flavor meat. Unlike a marinade, the dry rub will form a tasty crust on the exterior of the meat when grilled. If you have a recipe for a dry rub or you’ve made your own, apply it to your steaks by choosing thick cuts of meat and gently rubbing the spices into the steaks by hand to create a tasty meal for your friends and family to enjoy.

1.  Choose thick cut steaks. The flavor of very thin steaks can easily be overwhelmed by a dry rub. Choose steaks that are at least thick. Look for cuts of steak that are well marbled with little or no connective tissue. Great choices are ribeye steaks, t-bone steaks, New York strip steak, and sirloin steaks.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

2.  Put your dry rub ingredients in a container that can be sealed with a lid. Pour all of your dry rub ingredients into a container. Brown sugar, paprika, cumin, onion and garlic powder, mustard powder, chili flakes, cayenne, and thyme are some of the herbs and spices most commonly used in a rub. Add 1 tbsp (15 g) of each ingredient if you're creating a custom recipe.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

1.  Apply a generous amount of rub to each side of the steak with your hands. Work with 1 steak at a time. Grab a generous amount of spice rub from the bowl. Rub it into 1 side of the steak using your fingers. Cover the entire side of the steak evenly. Turn the steak over and apply the rub to the other side as well.[\[4\]](#_note-4)

    *   If you have a large cut of meat, use a spoon to sprinkle dry rub over it before rubbing it in instead of taking small handfuls at a time.
2.  Rub dry rub on the sides of the steaks. Pinch a small amount of dry rub in between your fingers. Drop it carefully over the sides 1 steak. Use your fingers to rub the spices into the meat. Make sure all of the steak is covered, leaving no meat untouched. Rub spices onto the sides of the other steaks as well.[\[5\]](#_note-5)  
      
    *   The more you rub your spices into the steak, the more flavorful it will be.
3.  Let the steaks sit in the fridge for at least 40 minutes or overnight. Depending on how much time you have, let the rub sit on the steak for at least 40 minutes or overnight. 40 minutes will allow the salt from the rub to soak into the meat, while letting it sit overnight will allow the steak to absorb more of the flavor and spice from your rub.[\[6\]](#_note-6)
