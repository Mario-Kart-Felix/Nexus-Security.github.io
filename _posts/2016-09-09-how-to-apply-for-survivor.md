Survivor is notoriously difficult to appear on, thanks to the huge number of applicants they receive for each season of the show. If you are determined to endure the long and grueling process, not to mention perform and compete on the program, then you will have to begin with the rest of the pack. Applying to be on Survivor requires you to either submit a video application that compels the casting crew to choose you for the next round, or to stand out at a local open casting call. With a little determination, and a few new skills, your application will shine and you may just have a chance at advancing as a semi-finalist.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Apply-for-Survivor&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Meeting Survivor’s Eligibility Requirements")\]Meeting Survivor’s Eligibility Requirements

1.  Have a US or Canadian passport as a citizen. CBS has two requirements that applicants for Survivor must meet. The first of these is to be a citizen of either the [United States](https://www.wikihow.com/Become-a-US-Citizen "Become a US Citizen") or [Canada](https://www.wikihow.com/Become-a-Canadian-Citizen "Become a Canadian Citizen"), and to have a valid [US](https://www.wikihow.com/Get-a-U.S.-Passport "Get a U.S. Passport") or [Canadian passport](https://www.wikihow.com/Get-a-Canadian-Passport "Get a Canadian Passport"). Be sure to apply for a passport well before you plan to apply, if you don’t already have one.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   Having a passport is a requirement because Survivor is filmed on location around the world. Without a passport, you will not be able to film the show.
2.  Be over 18 years of age, or older in certain US states. For most states and provinces, you simply have to be 18 or older to apply. Applying on your 18th birthday would be perfectly acceptable in these areas.[\[2\]](#_note-2)
    
    [![Apply for Survivor Step 2 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/29/Apply-for-Survivor-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/aid11292837-v4-728px-Apply-for-Survivor-Step-2-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Apply-for-Survivor-Step-2-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   Alabama and Nebraska residents must be 19 years or older.
    *   Residents of Mississippi and the District of Columbia must be 21 years or older.
3.  Be in good physical and mental shape. During later phases of the application process, if you proceed past the first, will be asked to complete medical history checks and undergo both physical and psychological fitness exams.[\[3\]](#_note-3)
    
    [![Apply for Survivor Step 3 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0e/Apply-for-Survivor-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid11292837-v4-728px-Apply-for-Survivor-Step-3-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Apply-for-Survivor-Step-3-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   You should be physically fit and have no major medical issues that could impact your performance.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Apply-for-Survivor&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Filming Your Application Video")\]Filming Your Application Video

1.  Write a general sketch of your video. A Survivor application video must be no longer than 3 minutes, and should showcase your unique personality and features. Your video can take any format you choose, so long as you are showing off your life story and your experiences.
    
    [![Apply for Survivor Step 4 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/26/Apply-for-Survivor-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid11292837-v4-728px-Apply-for-Survivor-Step-4-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Apply-for-Survivor-Step-4-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   Successful videos are often filmed in a variety of scenic locations, mixed in with narration over videos and images that show off your past, your life experiences, and your day-to-day life.
2.  Tell good stories about yourself. Using specific examples will always be better than listing facts about yourself. The video is a narrative like any other, and it should have a clear structure grounded in the story you want to tell about yourself.[\[4\]](#_note-4)
    
    [![Apply for Survivor Step 5 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4c/Apply-for-Survivor-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid11292837-v4-728px-Apply-for-Survivor-Step-5-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Apply-for-Survivor-Step-5-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   Bring up your most interesting traits. If you are from an area of the country most people have never been to, talk up your attachment to your community. If you work a particularly uncommon or difficult job, highlight the skills you have learned.
    *   Relate yourself to the show. The casting crew wants to see your knowledge of the show along with your personality.
3.  Use a camera to film your video, not a phone. Even though most smartphones have high quality cameras, it is better to rent or borrow a nice camera that will film you in the way only real cameras can. If you must use your phone, be sure to keep it horizontal, or landscape, rather than vertical.[\[5\]](#_note-5)
    
    [![Apply for Survivor Step 6 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/bf/Apply-for-Survivor-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/aid11292837-v4-728px-Apply-for-Survivor-Step-6-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Apply-for-Survivor-Step-6-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   The casting team watches videos on a TV screen, so your video should have the right dimensions to comfortably be viewed on a TV.
4.  Film your video in a quiet, well-lit space. You can film outdoors or indoors, but always choose a spot that is quiet and away from busy areas. The lighting should always be facing toward you. If the sun is directly behind you, move so that it is not making it hard to see your face.[\[6\]](#_note-6)
    
    [![Apply for Survivor Step 7 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f4/Apply-for-Survivor-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/aid11292837-v4-728px-Apply-for-Survivor-Step-7-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Apply-for-Survivor-Step-7-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   Filming outdoors can create an image that is in line with Survivor’s premise, by suggesting that you are comfortable outside.
    *   Shoot outdoors during the day unless you have a good reason to film at night. Natural sunlight will be more flattering than no light or bright artificial ones.
    *   Wind can make it difficult to hear your voice. Shoot outdoors only if it is not windy.
5.  Give a good delivery. Speak in a clear voice that will be audible in the video. [Enunciate](https://www.wikihow.com/Enunciate "Enunciate") your words and use a voice that is audible to everyone in the room. You should speak in a tone that readily grabs attention, rather than a monotone or one that conveys an over-eager attitude.[\[7\]](#_note-7)
    
    [![Apply for Survivor Step 8 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d7/Apply-for-Survivor-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/aid11292837-v4-728px-Apply-for-Survivor-Step-8-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Apply-for-Survivor-Step-8-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   Avoid reading from a script. Memorize at least the general structure of what you wrote, or memorize your lines cold if you wrote exactly what you plan to say.
    *   You can also just improvise and try several different phrasings of each idea you plan to introduce. This will make sure your video has a natural, conversational flow.
6.  [Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/Edit-a-Video-Clip "Edit a Video Clip") your video using [editing software](https://www.wikihow.com/Learn-Video-Editing "Learn Video Editing"). There are many editing suites available to you. Apple computers come pre-installed with iMovie, while newer Windows computers have a simple editing tool in the Photos application.
    
    [![Apply for Survivor Step 9 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6f/Apply-for-Survivor-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/aid11292837-v4-728px-Apply-for-Survivor-Step-9-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Apply-for-Survivor-Step-9-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   There is also third party software available, like Lightworks, which is a free download, and Adobe Premiere, which is a more expensive and complicated option, with many more features.
    *   At a minimum, you will have to learn how to import your raw footage and splice the clips together, cutting or “trimming” unnecessary footage.
    *   Keep in mind that you are not being judged on your editing skills. The video can be a rough cut so long as it looks clean and your personality shines through.
7.  Add pictures and videos of your daily life. As you edit, you will likely want to include images or videos that depict what you spoke about on camera, or ones you wrote down in your outline and plan to record a voice-over for.[\[8\]](#_note-8)
    
    [![Apply for Survivor Step 10 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4f/Apply-for-Survivor-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/aid11292837-v4-728px-Apply-for-Survivor-Step-10-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Apply-for-Survivor-Step-10-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   Be sure to keep the audio layer in place as you cut out the video and replace it with a new photo or clip, or add each layer separately for a voice-over. Most editing tools have separate audio and visual layers that you can freely edit.
8.  Use a soundtrack under your narration to keep the pace up. While it is not necessary, adding a soundtrack with some of your favorite music that fits the image of yourself you are presenting can help your video feel more exciting.
    
    [![Apply for Survivor Step 11 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b0/Apply-for-Survivor-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/aid11292837-v4-728px-Apply-for-Survivor-Step-11-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Apply-for-Survivor-Step-11-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   Listening to someone talk for 3 minutes can be tiring, but with the right music you can liven up the casting crew’s experience.
    *   You can use select portions of a few songs to mark transitions. When you switch topics, a new song can make the change clearer.
9.  Attend a local casting call rather than film a video. At peak application times, usually in the months preceding a new season, CBS will host open casting calls in select US and Canadian cities. If you attend one of these, they will film your audition and there is no need to film a tape on your own. Be sure to bring your photo I.D. to an open call.[\[9\]](#_note-9)
    
    [![Apply for Survivor Step 12 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/28/Apply-for-Survivor-Step-12-Version-2.jpg/aid11292837-v4-728px-Apply-for-Survivor-Step-12-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Apply-for-Survivor-Step-12-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   An open call is a great opportunity for someone without the time or resources to write, film, and edit their own application video.
    *   You can attend an open call in addition to submitting a video to raise your chances.
    *   Check for open calls at [https://www.cbssurvivorcasting.com/opencalls](https://www.cbssurvivorcasting.com/opencalls).

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Apply-for-Survivor&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Filing Your Application Online")\]Filing Your Application Online

1.  Go to the Survivor application website. The URL is [https://www.cbssurvivorcasting.com/apply](https://www.cbssurvivorcasting.com/apply). There, you will find the online application for the show. Be prepared to fill out the entire application at once and upload both your application video and a recent photo of yourself in a standard file format.
    
    [![Apply for Survivor Step 13 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/ef/Apply-for-Survivor-Step-13-Version-2.jpg/aid11292837-v4-728px-Apply-for-Survivor-Step-13-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Apply-for-Survivor-Step-13-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   You must complete the application in one sitting.
2.  Enter your basic contact information. This includes your name, email, phone number, and address. This information will provide CBS with a way to reach out to you if you are accepted, as well as to narrow down candidates by location.[\[10\]](#_note-10)
    
    [![Apply for Survivor Step 14 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/04/Apply-for-Survivor-Step-14-Version-2.jpg/aid11292837-v4-728px-Apply-for-Survivor-Step-14-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Apply-for-Survivor-Step-14-Version-2.jpg)
    
3.  Provide your appearance information. You will be asked to share your date of birth and gender, as well as your height, weight, hair color, and ethnicity. CBS will use this information to sort the applications and choose applicants in a certain demographic or appearance range to fill slots for each season.[\[11\]](#_note-11)
    
    [![Apply for Survivor Step 15 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e6/Apply-for-Survivor-Step-15-Version-2.jpg/aid11292837-v4-728px-Apply-for-Survivor-Step-15-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Apply-for-Survivor-Step-15-Version-2.jpg)
    
4.  Describe your situation. The application asks for your current occupation and past education, your relationship status, and your familiarity with Survivor. You should be honest about your situation, and it should match the information you provided in your application video.[\[12\]](#_note-12)
    
    [![Apply for Survivor Step 16 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/52/Apply-for-Survivor-Step-16-Version-2.jpg/aid11292837-v4-728px-Apply-for-Survivor-Step-16-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Apply-for-Survivor-Step-16-Version-2.jpg)
    
5.  Write a 500 character biography. You should take time to write a thoughtful, exciting, and compelling biography that summarizes who you are. Don’t copy what you say in your video, but do try to capture your main selling points briefly. This is a sales pitch for yourself, so be sure to take it seriously.[\[13\]](#_note-13)
    
    [![Apply for Survivor Step 17 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/92/Apply-for-Survivor-Step-17-Version-2.jpg/aid11292837-v4-728px-Apply-for-Survivor-Step-17-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Apply-for-Survivor-Step-17-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   Have a friend proofread your biography. You won’t want typos in your application, as this can reflect badly on you.
6.  Share your social media accounts. CBS will want to know what your online presence is like, in order to confirm that you are a good fit for the show. The social media they request are Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.[\[14\]](#_note-14)
    
    [![Apply for Survivor Step 18 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f4/Apply-for-Survivor-Step-18-Version-2.jpg/aid11292837-v4-728px-Apply-for-Survivor-Step-18-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Apply-for-Survivor-Step-18-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   You may want to emphasize your worthy traits on social media in the months leading up to your application, but don’t cram them all in or make them seem forced.
7.  Upload your picture. The picture should be a high quality portrait of you. There should not be anyone else in the photo, and your face should be clearly visible. The file must be less than 5MB, and in one of the following formats: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, or .gif.[\[15\]](#_note-15)
    
    [![Apply for Survivor Step 19 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/bf/Apply-for-Survivor-Step-19-Version-2.jpg/aid11292837-v4-728px-Apply-for-Survivor-Step-19-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Apply-for-Survivor-Step-19-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   Your picture should be recent, and match the description you gave in the application.
8.  Submit your video. The file you submit must be less than 50MB and be in one of the following formats: .mpg, .mpeg, .avi, .mp4, .wmv, .mov, .3gp, or .mkv. Before uploading, watch the video one more time to check for any problems with the file.[\[16\]](#_note-16)
    
    [![Apply for Survivor Step 20 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3c/Apply-for-Survivor-Step-20-Version-2.jpg/aid11292837-v4-728px-Apply-for-Survivor-Step-20-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Apply-for-Survivor-Step-20-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   Give your file a helpful name, like one that includes your full name and the phrase “Survivor Application Video”.
9.  Wait for a response. Only those who CBS wishes to move forward are accepted as semi-finalists, so if you don’t hear back by the end of the September before the season you applied for, you most likely were not selected.
    
    [![Apply for Survivor Step 21 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/24/Apply-for-Survivor-Step-21-Version-2.jpg/aid11292837-v4-728px-Apply-for-Survivor-Step-21-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Apply-for-Survivor-Step-21-Version-2.jpg)
    
10.  Submit a new application or attend a casting call again if yours was not accepted. While you will have to create a whole new video and file the application again, the good news is that you can apply as many times as you want. Unless you were a finalist in the casting process, you still have another chance at being on Survivor.[\[17\]](#_note-17)
