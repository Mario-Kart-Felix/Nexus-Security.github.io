If your skin is looking a little dull or you want to mix up your skincare routine, add vitamin C serum. To get radiant looking skin, wash your face and then rub a few drops of the serum into your skin. The antioxidants in vitamin C can reduce inflammation and help your skin repair itself. Remember to apply a moisturizer next and enjoy your glowing skin!

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Apply-Vitamin-C-Serum-for-Facial-Skin-Care&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Using the Serum Effectively")\]Using the Serum Effectively

1.  Do a [patch test](https://www.wikihow.com/Patch-Test-Skin "Patch Test Skin") to check for an allergic reaction. Rub 1 drop of the vitamin C serum onto a small patch of your inner wrist. Since the skin is sensitive here, you're more likely to notice a reaction to the vitamin C. Wait 24 hours to see if your skin is irritated or breaks out in a rash. If it doesn't, you can use vitamin C on your face.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   If you do have a reaction to the vitamin C, don't use it as part of your daily skincare routine and mention it to your doctor or dermatologist.
    *   If you also use AHAs and BHAs, such as glycolic, salicylic, or lactic acids, wait a few minutes before applying the vitamin C serum or you'll risk irritating your skin.
2.  Plan on using the serum in the morning or before bed. Because your skin can only absorb so much vitamin C in a day, you only need to apply it once a day. Decide if you'd like to make it part of your morning skincare routine and remember to apply sunscreen after using the serum. If you prefer, apply the serum in the evening before you apply your nighttime moisturizer.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

3.  Wash your face with a gentle cleanser. Splash cool water over your face and rub a coin-sized amount of cleanser evenly across your [face](https://www.wikihow.com/Wash-Your-Face "Wash Your Face"). Use your fingertips to gently massage the cleanser into your skin for about 30 seconds. Then, use water to rinse the cleanser off of your face.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

    *   Use a cleanser that's designed for your skin type. For example, if you have sensitive skin, use a fragrance-free cleanser that doesn't contain alcohol.
4.  Dry your skin and pat [toner](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Toner "Use Toner") across your face. Blot your face dry with a clean cloth and then soak a cotton ball in facial toner. Brush the cotton ball evenly across your face, but avoid getting toner around your eyes. Then, let the toner dry before you apply the vitamin C serum.

    *   If you have oily skin and use a toner that contains benzoyl peroxide, wait at least 5 minutes before using the serum. Mixing the benzoyl peroxide with vitamin C could prevent the serum from working effectively.
5.  Rub 2 to 3 drops of serum onto your face. Use the dropper in the bottle of serum to squeeze 2 to 3 drops of vitamin C serum into an open palm. Then, rub the fingers of your other hand into the oil and dab some of it onto your cheeks and forehead. Massage the oil evenly across the rest of your face.[\[4\]](#_note-4)

6.  Wait 5 to 10 minutes before applying [moisturizer](https://www.wikihow.com/Apply-Moisturizer "Apply Moisturizer"). Give the vitamin C serum a chance to soak into your skin before you put another skincare product on. Once your skin feels like it's absorbed the serum, gently massage moisturizer across your face.[\[5\]](#_note-5)

    *   If you're doing the facial in the morning, consider using a daytime moisturizer that contains SPF to protect your skin.

    *   For severe facial acne, talk with your dermatologist about microneedling with vitamin C.
2.  Protect your skin from sun damage by applying vitamin C and E serum. If you'd like to [protect your skin](https://www.wikihow.com/Protect-Your-Skin "Protect Your Skin") from damaging UV rays, always put sunscreen on your face before going out.

    *   The vitamins help your skin repair itself from sun exposure, which is why you should apply it after being exposed to UV rays.
