Google now offers a tool that [automatically deletes](https://www.howtogeek.com/442676/google-announces-new-security-and-privacy-options/) your search and activity history from YouTube. By default, your data is stored forever, but it can be wiped from Google’s servers every 3 or 18 months.

Similar auto-delete settings are available for your location history as well as your “Web & app history.” These aren’t just privacy settings—choosing to wipe your history regularly means Google won’t use that wiped YouTube history to personalize your video recommendations.

Automatically Delete History from YouTube Mobile App
----------------------------------------------------

You can set up automatic history deletion directly from your smartphone or tablet. That’s convenient because [more than 50 percent](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/) of all YouTube viewership happens on the video service’s mobile apps.

To start, open the “YouTube” app on your device. If you can’t find it on your home screen or app drawer, iPhone and iPad owners can use [Apple’s Spotlight search](https://www.howtogeek.com/229060/how-to-use-spotlight-search-on-your-iphone-or-ipad/) to find the app, and Android users can use Google’s search bar.
