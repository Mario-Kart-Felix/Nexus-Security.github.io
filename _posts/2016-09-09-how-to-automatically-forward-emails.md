We’ll show you how to forward Outlook email to Gmail and vice-versa, whether you use Outlook on the web or desktop.

How to Automatically Forward Emails in Outlook Desktop
------------------------------------------------------

First, we’ll cover how to auto-forward emails to Gmail in Outlook’s desktop version. To do this, you need to create a rule using these steps:

1.  Open Outlook. On the **Home** tab, find the **Move** section. There, select **Rules** and choose **Manage Rules & Alerts** in the dropdown.  
    
2.  Click **New Rule**.
3.  Under **Start from a blank rule**, select **Apply rule on messages I receive**. Click **Next**.  
    
4.  Select the criteria for the kinds of messages you want to forward. If you want to forward every email that arrives, leave these selections blank. Click **Next** and confirm the prompt if you see a dialog box warning that this will apply to all messages.
5.  In Step 1 of the next window, select **Forward it to people or public group**. (If you prefer, **Forward it to people or public group as an attachment** works too.) Then in Step 2, click the link text for **people or public group**.  
    
6.  Enter the email address of the contact you want to forward the email to in the **To** box at the bottom. You can select from your contacts in the above box instead of entering them manually and can enter as many addresses as you like.  
    
7.  Next, you have the choice of certain criteria for emails you want to exclude from this rule. You don’t need to choose anything, but if you like, you can filter emails from certain senders or that contain specific words, for example.
8.  Enter a name for your rule so it’s easy to locate in the future. Then make sure **Turn on this rule** is checked and click **Finish**.
    

You’re all done forwarding your Outlook messages to Gmail. Every email you receive (that fits the criteria you set, if applicable) will forward to the address you specified.

To stop forwarding the emails, just go back to the **Home** tab, click **Rules** > **Manage Rules & Alerts**, and uncheck the box next to the rule you want to disable.

How to Automatically Forward Emails in Gmail
--------------------------------------------

Want to automatically forward emails in Gmail instead? It’s a similar process to forwarding in Outlook but has one main difference. When forwarding emails in Outlook, you don’t have to do anything on the forwarding address account. However, with Gmail, the receiving email address must grant you permission to forward emails.

The first step in automatically forwarding Gmail emails is to add those forwarding addresses. To do this:

1.  Go to your Gmail options by clicking the gear at the top-right corner and choosing **Settings**.
2.  Open the [Forwarding and POP/IMAP](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/fwdandpop) tab.
3.  At the top of the page under the **Forwarding** subheading, click **Add a forwarding address**.
4.  In the window that pops up, enter the email address you want to forward emails to. Note that you can only enter one email address at a time. Click **Next** when done.
5.  The chosen email address will receive an email. The owner must click the link inside to grant you permission to forward them emails.

Once you have approval, you can easily auto-forward all emails to the new address on the same page. Enable the **Forward a copy of incoming mail to** field and choose your forwarding address from the list. Using the second box, you can choose from four options for what happens to the original message in your inbox:

*   Keep the email in the inbox, untouched
*   Mark the message as read in your inbox
*   Archive the original message
*   Delete the original

### Filtering Forwarded Emails in Gmail

If you don’t want to forward all email, use the below steps to create a filter that only forwards certain messages from Gmail:

1.  Go to Gmail’s **Settings** and open the [Filters and Blocked Addresses](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/filters) tab. Use the link to jump right to it, if you’re logged in.
2.  At the bottom of your filter list, click **Create a new filter**.
3.  Enter the criteria for the emails you want to forward. If you want to forward all emails, just enter your email address in the **To** field and click **Create filter**.  
    
4.  Select **Forward it to**. From the dropdown menu, select the address you want to forward the emails to. Enable any other options if you’d like, and click **Create filter**.  
    

To stop forwarding emails, go back to **Settings** > **Filters and Blocked Addresses** and click **delete** next to the rule you want to get rid of.

How to Automatically Forward Emails in Outlook.com
--------------------------------------------------

Finally, let’s look at how to forward messages from the web version of Outlook.

To start, sign into [Outlook.com](https://outlook.live.com/) mail and click the **Settings** gear in the upper-right corner. Scroll down to the bottom of the sidebar that appears and select **View all Outlook settings**.

On the resulting screen, make sure you have **Mail** selected at the far left, then browse to the **Forwarding** tab. At this point, you may need to verify your account before moving on.

On the **Forwarding** page, tick the **Enable forwarding** option and enter the email address you want to forward to. If you check **Keep a copy of forwarded messages**, they’ll stay in your Outlook inbox as well.

Click **Save** at the bottom to complete the process. That’s all it takes to forward emails from Outlook’s web app to Gmail or another service. To disable forwarding, simply come back to this page, uncheck the **Enable forwarding** box, and hit **Save** again.

How to Import Outlook Mail and Contacts Into Gmail
--------------------------------------------------

Above, we looked at how to forward all new Outlook mail to your Gmail account. If you’d like, you can also bring over messages currently in your inbox, plus your contacts, in an easy step using Gmail’s import tool. This works for pretty much any email address, not just Outlook.

Open your Gmail account and click the **Gear** icon in the upper-right, then choose **Settings**. Choose **Accounts and Import** along the top. On this page, click **Import mail and contacts**.

This will open a new window. Enter the Outlook email address you want to import from. After confirming its credentials, you’ll see a list of permissions you must grant.

Click **Yes** to accept them. Finally, you’ll see an **Import Options** window.

Choose the boxes to **Import mail** and **Import contacts**, if you want to. You can also check **Import new mail for 30 days**, though this is unnecessary if you’ve done the forwarding above.

Depending on how much mail you have in Outlook, this could take some time. Your mail will appear in Gmail as it progresses.

How to Important Outlook Contacts to Google Contacts
----------------------------------------------------

If the above tool didn’t work for some reason, you can transfer your Outlook contacts to Gmail using the Google Contacts import tool. While logged into your Gmail account, open [Google Contacts](https://contacts.google.com/). On the left side of the screen, choose **Import**.

Gmail will ask you for a CSV file containing your contacts. To obtain this, take a look at [our guide to import and export email contacts](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/quick-guide-importing-exporting-email-contacts/).
