[Ear pain](https://www.wikihow.com/Relieve-Ear-Pain "Relieve Ear Pain") is a common and unpleasant experience for airplane travelers. You may experience pain, stuffiness, or discomfort in your ears during takeoff and landing, when rapid changes in altitude cause an imbalance between the air pressure in the cabin and the air pressure inside your ears. Fortunately, you can protect your ears during the flight by swallowing frequently and using special breathing techniques to clear your ears. Flying while congested can make pain due to pressure changes worse, but you can minimize this problem by taking a few simple precautions before your flight.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Avoid-Ear-Pain-During-a-Flight&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Equalizing the Pressure in Your Ears")\]Equalizing the Pressure in Your Ears

1.  Yawn and swallow to clear your ears during descent and ascent. The actions of yawning and swallowing can open up your eustachian tubes, helping to equalize the pressure in your ears. During takeoff and landing, yawn and swallow any time you feel pressure building up in your ears.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   Chewing gum, sucking on candy, or drinking through a straw can help you swallow.
2.  Get your child to drink or suck on a pacifier at takeoff and landing. This will help equalize the pressure in your child's ears and eustachian tubes. Let an older child sip on a bottle of water or a juice. If you're flying with a baby, give them a bottle or their pacifier.

    *   This is the easiest way to prevent ear pain in your child.
3.  Try the Valsalva maneuver to equalize the pressure in your ears. If your ears start to feel clogged or painful during takeoff or landing, pinch your nose shut and close your mouth. Blow gently through your nostrils, as if you were trying to blow your nose. You may need to do this several times. This technique will help equalize the pressure between your ears and the outside air.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

4.  Use filtered earplugs to balance the air pressure in your ears. Filtered earplugs can help regulate the pressure in your ears during takeoff and landing, preventing ear pain.[\[3\]](#_note-3) Look for earplugs specifically designed for use on planes, such as EarPlanes. For best results, put the earplugs in an hour before you take off and take them out right after you land.[\[4\]](#_note-4)
    
    [![Avoid Ear Pain During a Flight Step 4.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d9/Avoid-Ear-Pain-During-a-Flight-Step-4.jpg/aid10915555-v4-728px-Avoid-Ear-Pain-During-a-Flight-Step-4.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Avoid-Ear-Pain-During-a-Flight-Step-4.jpg)
    
    *   You can purchase filtered ear plugs in a pharmacy or at an airline gift shop. If you’re traveling with kids, look for child-sized earplugs.
    *   Before you put in the earplugs, pinch your nose shut and gently blow through your nostrils to clear your ears.
5.  Stay awake during takeoff and landing so you can monitor your ears. If you nod off during ascent or descent, you may not notice that your ears are becoming clogged until the problem becomes painfully severe. Try to do your sleeping while the plane is cruising so that you can be awake to protect your ears during takeoff and landing.[\[5\]](#_note-5)
    
    [![Avoid Ear Pain During a Flight Step 5.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2b/Avoid-Ear-Pain-During-a-Flight-Step-5.jpg/aid10915555-v4-728px-Avoid-Ear-Pain-During-a-Flight-Step-5.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Avoid-Ear-Pain-During-a-Flight-Step-5.jpg)
    
    *   If you’re travelling with a companion, ask them to wake you before the plane lands or if you fall asleep during takeoff.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Avoid-Ear-Pain-During-a-Flight&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Using Medication to Prevent Ear Pain")\]Using Medication to Prevent Ear Pain

1.  Use a nasal spray 30 minutes before flying if you’re congested. Nasal congestion can make it harder to equalize the pressure between your ears and the outside air. If you’re already congested or concerned about getting congested during the flight, get an over-the-counter nasal spray and use it 30 minutes to 1 hour before you take off. Use it again before you land.[\[6\]](#_note-6)
    
    [![Avoid Ear Pain During a Flight Step 6.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/04/Avoid-Ear-Pain-During-a-Flight-Step-6.jpg/aid10915555-v4-728px-Avoid-Ear-Pain-During-a-Flight-Step-6.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Avoid-Ear-Pain-During-a-Flight-Step-6.jpg)
    
    *   Before takeoff and right after landing, administer 1-2 drops of your nasal decongestant to each nostril.
    *   Try not to use your nasal spray often in the days leading up to the flight. Using a decongestant spray for several days in a row can actually make your congestion worse.
2.  Try oral decongestants if your doctor recommends it. If you have to fly while you’re congested, ask your doctor about using an oral decongestant medication. Take the medication 30 minutes to 1 hour before takeoff for maximum effectiveness.[\[7\]](#_note-7)
    
    [![Avoid Ear Pain During a Flight Step 7.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/ff/Avoid-Ear-Pain-During-a-Flight-Step-7.jpg/aid10915555-v4-728px-Avoid-Ear-Pain-During-a-Flight-Step-7.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Avoid-Ear-Pain-During-a-Flight-Step-7.jpg)
    
    *   Your doctor may recommend against taking oral decongestants if you have certain health conditions, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, pregnancy, or an enlarged prostate.
    *   Let your doctor know if you are taking any other medications that might interact with the decongestant.
3.  Take allergy medications an hour before flying if necessary. If you have allergies, managing them with medication before you fly can help prevent ear pain.[\[8\]](#_note-8) Keep in mind that some medications (such as Claritin) may take a little longer than others to start working, so try to time your dose accordingly.[\[9\]](#_note-9)
    
    [![Avoid Ear Pain During a Flight Step 8.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c1/Avoid-Ear-Pain-During-a-Flight-Step-8.jpg/aid10915555-v4-728px-Avoid-Ear-Pain-During-a-Flight-Step-8.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Avoid-Ear-Pain-During-a-Flight-Step-8.jpg)
    
    *   Antihistamine medications are a good option for preventing in-flight ear pain related to allergy congestion.[\[10\]](#_note-10)
4.  Look into rescheduling your flight if you’re really sick. Flying when you have a severe cold, sinus infection, or ear infection can be a miserable experience. It also puts you at increased risk of severe ear pain and other complications of airplane ear, such as vertigo, hearing loss, or ruptured eardrums. If you’re very sick or congested, consider postponing your flight until after you feel better.[\[11\]](#_note-11)
    
    [![Avoid Ear Pain During a Flight Step 9.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2b/Avoid-Ear-Pain-During-a-Flight-Step-9.jpg/aid10915555-v4-728px-Avoid-Ear-Pain-During-a-Flight-Step-9.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Avoid-Ear-Pain-During-a-Flight-Step-9.jpg)
    
    *   Some airlines may waive flight cancellation or rescheduling fees if you can provide a doctor’s note.[\[12\]](#_note-12)
    *   If you’re being treated for an ear infection or have recently had ear surgery, ask your doctor if it’s safe for you to fly.
5.  Ask a doctor about medicated eardrops to prevent ear pain in kids. If you’re flying with small children, talk to your pediatrician ahead of time. They may be able to prescribe eardrops containing numbing agents or pain relievers for your child.[\[13\]](#_note-13)
    
    [![Avoid Ear Pain During a Flight Step 10.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/56/Avoid-Ear-Pain-During-a-Flight-Step-10.jpg/aid10915555-v4-728px-Avoid-Ear-Pain-During-a-Flight-Step-10.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Avoid-Ear-Pain-During-a-Flight-Step-10.jpg)
    
    *   Because their eustachian tubes are smaller than those of adults, children are especially prone to ear pain on planes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   If you fly frequently and suffer from severe airplane ear, ask your doctor about getting tubes implanted in your ears. This surgical procedure can improve drainage in your ears and help balance the pressure between your outer and middle ear.[\[14\]](#_note-14)
*   Flight-related ear pain usually goes away on its own or with a little basic self-care. However, in rare cases, it can last for a long time or cause serious complications. See a doctor if your ear pain lasts longer than a few hours or if you experience severe symptoms, such as extreme ear pain, hearing loss, bleeding from your ears, vertigo, or ringing in your ears (tinnitus).[\[15\]](#_note-15)
