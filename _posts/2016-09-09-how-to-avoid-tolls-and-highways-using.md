Aside from showing accurate results, Apple’s [navigation app](https://beebom.com/best-gps-navigation-apps-iphone/) has added several notable features like [ETA sharing](https://beebom.com/how-share-your-live-route-eta-apple-maps-iphone/) and keeping tolls and motorways at bay. If you use the stock navigation app, you should know this helpful feature to not only reach your destination on time but also save money. All set? Follow along as I show you how you can avoid tolls and motorways in Apple Maps on iPhone and Mac!
