Ever since I got a hang of Apple ecosystem, one of the important lessons that I have learned is “Never fail to back up your device.” Unexpected things tend to happen when you expect them the least. When you are dealing with a ton of sensitive information and personal data, it’s always better to stay on the safer side so that even if something untoward happens, all of [your data remains untouched](https://beebom.com/how-recover-deleted-icloud-contacts-calendars-bookmarks/). That said, the process to back up iOS device on Mac running [macOS Catalina](https://beebom.com/macos-catalina-features/) has changed – courtesy the shutdown of iTunes. But don’t worry the substitute is doing an equally efficient job. Let me show you how to back up and restore the iPhone/iPad in macOS Catalina or later!  

How to Back Up Your iPhone/iPad Using Finder on Mac
---------------------------------------------------

  

After shutting down iTunes, Apple has introduced three new apps which are [Apple TV](https://beebom.com/best-tips-tricks-apple-tv-app/), Music, and [Apple Podcasts](https://beebom.com/best-tips-tricks-podcasts-app-mac/), to let users handle movies, shows, music, and podcasts a bit conveniently. Wondering which app has donned the role of an iOS device manager? Well, it’s none other than the powerful Finder that has now assumed the role of iPhone and iPad manager. From letting you back up your data, restore the device from backup to [sync the device](https://beebom.com/sync-iphone-ipad-with-mac-macos-catalina/), it does all the assigned tasks without any hiccups – at least so far. That all being said, let’s get started with the guide!  

1\. First off, connect your iPhone or iPad to your computer using a USB cable. Then, launch **Finder** on your Mac running macOS Catalina.

_**Note:** You may get a popup on your iOS device to trust the computer. Tap on “Trust” in the popup and then enter your device passcode to continue. _  

2\. In the sidebar, select your **iPhone** that is under the Locations section.

_**Note:**_  

*   _If you want to encrypt your iOS device backup to protect it from unauthorized access, make sure to check the box for **“Encrypt local backup.”** Then, you will need to create a password for your encrypted backup._
  
*   _Make sure to store the password safely as you won’t be able to use the backup without it._
  
*   _Once you have confirmed the password, your backup will begin immediately. _
  
*   _The encrypted backup includes your saved passwords, WiFi settings, health data, and website history._

That’s pretty much it! Now, allow your device to get backed up peacefully via Finder. The time it will take to finish backing up all the data entirely depends the amount of data you have stored on your iPhone. So, grab a hot coffee to wait patiently while the Finder is performing the task.

So, that’s the right way to back up and restore iOS and iPadOS devices using Finder on macOS Catalina. From what I can tell, the decision to eliminate iTunes seems to be a well-timed move as the erstwhile media library was struggling to survive against the cut-throat competition. Besides, Finder is doing a fairly good job of managing the devices.
