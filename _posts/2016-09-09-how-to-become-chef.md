You might decide to become a chef because you enjoy cooking and like to experiment in the kitchen. While it’s a demanding career, it can also be very satisfying if it’s something you love. Start building the cooking skills you need to become a chef by practicing at home, getting a restaurant job, and getting feedback from others. Then, pursue training to be a chef, either at school or under the guidance of a mentor. Finally, get a job at a restaurant and work your way up to the role of chef.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Become-a-Chef&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Developing Your Cooking Skills")\]Developing Your Cooking Skills

1.  Practice cooking at home to build your skills. Pick recipes that you find appealing, then make them yourself. As you get better at cooking, try recipes that include new skills that you haven’t yet tried. Don’t be afraid to experiment with recipes to make them your own.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   Play around with different types of cuisine to see what fits your style and taste. For example, you might make Italian food one night, Mexican food the next night, then your own twist on hamburgers.
2.  Experiment with food to create your own recipes. Part of the fun of being a chef is making your own special dishes. Once you’re familiar with common ingredients, start playing around with recipes to make them your own. Take risks so you can create something totally new![\[2\]](#_note-2)

    *   Start by making changes to an existing recipe to make something different. Then, try mixing ingredients without following a recipe.
    *   Some of your creations will be a success, while others might be inedible. This is normal, so don’t give up!
3.  Cook for other people to get feedback on your meals. While it’s scary to open yourself up to criticism, feedback can help you grow as a chef. Make food for people as often as you can, then ask them what they liked or didn’t like about your dishes. Incorporate the feedback that makes sense to you.[\[3\]](#_note-3)
    
    [![Become a Chef Step 3 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/09/Become-a-Chef-Step-3-Version-3.jpg/aid2446-v4-728px-Become-a-Chef-Step-3-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Become-a-Chef-Step-3-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   If you can, serve your food to people who enjoy the type of cuisine you like to make. They’ll be able to provide a better opinion. For instance, let’s say you enjoy making Indian food. You’ll get better feedback from someone who enjoys Indian food.
4.  Watch other chefs to learn their techniques. You can learn a lot from watching others. Watch cooking shows and online tutorials to see how other chefs work. Additionally, observe chefs or chefs-in-training who you know. Try to learn from the way they work.[\[4\]](#_note-4)
    
    [![Become a Chef Step 4 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/1e/Become-a-Chef-Step-4-Version-3.jpg/aid2446-v4-728px-Become-a-Chef-Step-4-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Become-a-Chef-Step-4-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   Don’t worry about copying the way someone does something. You want to have your own style! However, it helps to watch how they perform certain skills and how they get creative with ingredients.
5.  Get a job at a restaurant to build your skills and resume. While it would be awesome to start out as a chef, it takes time to work your way up the career ladder. Start with a low-level restaurant job that will help you learn the skills you need. Apply for any restaurant jobs that you see advertised locally.[\[5\]](#_note-5)
    
    [![Become a Chef Step 5 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8a/Become-a-Chef-Step-5-Version-3.jpg/aid2446-v4-728px-Become-a-Chef-Step-5-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Become-a-Chef-Step-5-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   Your first restaurant job probably won’t be prestigious, but everyone starts at the bottom. You’ll likely work as a line cook. This will help you learn the skills you need to move up the career ladder and eventually become a chef.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Become-a-Chef&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Training to Be a Chef")\]Training to Be a Chef

1.  Enroll in a culinary arts program for a comprehensive education. While attending a culinary school isn’t required for chefs, it may help you get a job. Most culinary programs offer a broad education in nutrition, sanitary food preparation techniques, butchery, pastry making, and other basic cooking knowledge. Research culinary programs, then apply to your top 3-5 choices.[\[6\]](#_note-6)
    
    [![Become a Chef Step 6 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4c/Become-a-Chef-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/aid2446-v4-728px-Become-a-Chef-Step-6-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Become-a-Chef-Step-6-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   Programs are offered at trade or vocational schools, colleges, and culinary institutes. You may be able to earn a certificate in culinary arts from a trade or vocational school in 6-9 months. If you want an associate's degree in culinary arts from a community college, expect your program to take about 2 years. Additionally, you can earn a 4-year bachelor's degree in culinary arts from a college, university, or culinary institute.
    *   Look for a program that offers classes in business, management, and human resources if you think you might open up your own restaurant someday.
2.  Train at home if you plan to be a self-taught chef. While going to a culinary school helps you learn the skills you need, you might choose to teach yourself what you need to know. Practice cooking in your own kitchen every day. Cook meals for your family or host events in your home to get more practice. Push yourself out of your comfort zone to help you learn the skills you need.[\[7\]](#_note-7)
    
    [![Become a Chef Step 7 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a1/Become-a-Chef-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/aid2446-v4-728px-Become-a-Chef-Step-7-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Become-a-Chef-Step-7-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   Volunteer to cook for parties and events if people buy the ingredients for your recipes.
    *   Use online tutorials and cookbooks to learn new skills.
3.  Find an internship at a restaurant to build your resume. While an internship isn’t very glamorous, it can open up doors to the job you want. Contact local restaurants to ask about available internships. If you can’t find one, ask a local chef or restaurant owner if they’d consider taking you on as a short-term intern. During this time, watch the chef, sous chef, and line cooks to learn new skills. Additionally, follow all of the instructions they give you exactly.[\[8\]](#_note-8)
    
    [![Become a Chef Step 8 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/51/Become-a-Chef-Step-8-Version-3.jpg/aid2446-v4-728px-Become-a-Chef-Step-8-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Become-a-Chef-Step-8-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   Some culinary arts schools have relationships with local restaurants that offer internships for students.
    *   Your internship will likely be unpaid. However, treat it like a regular job so you can get a good reference when you apply for jobs.
4.  Get a certification if you focus on a particular area. Typically, you don’t need any certifications to be a chef. However, you might choose to get one if you have a specialization that you plan to pursue. If you’ve trained in a particular area, take a certification test to help you strengthen your resume.[\[9\]](#_note-9)
    
    [![Become a Chef Step 9 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/dc/Become-a-Chef-Step-9-Version-3.jpg/aid2446-v4-728px-Become-a-Chef-Step-9-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Become-a-Chef-Step-9-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   For instance, you might get certified as a master pastry chef, a decorator, or a sous chef.
    *   If you have the required education and experience, you can take a certification test through the Research Chefs Association, the American Culinary Federation, the Culinary Institute of America, and the United States Personal Chef Association.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Become-a-Chef&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Working Your Way up to Chef")\]Working Your Way up to Chef

1.  Apply for entry-level kitchen positions at local restaurants. When you’re starting your restaurant career, be open to any position that comes your way. Look for jobs in local restaurants, then send them your application, cover letter, and resume. Send out several applications at once to increase your chances of getting a job.[\[10\]](#_note-10)
    
    [![Become a Chef Step 10.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b9/Become-a-Chef-Step-10.jpg/aid2446-v4-728px-Become-a-Chef-Step-10.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Become-a-Chef-Step-10.jpg)
    
    *   You might start as a kitchen assistant or garde manger, which is the person who prepares appetizers, soups, and cold dishes. The next step up is line cook, then sous chef, which is the position directly under the head chef. Finally, you might become the head chef of a restaurant.
    *   If you've previously worked in a kitchen, you'll likely be able to get a better job than someone who's just starting out.
2.  Network with other chefs and restaurant owners to build connections. Connections might help you move up the career ladder faster. Talk to other chefs, meet restaurant owners, and attend industry events to interact with others in your field. This will help you build relationships with people who might help your career.[\[11\]](#_note-11)
    
    [![Become a Chef Step 11.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/03/Become-a-Chef-Step-11.jpg/aid2446-v4-728px-Become-a-Chef-Step-11.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Become-a-Chef-Step-11.jpg)
    
    *   When you’re at an event with served food, ask to talk to the chef.
    *   Talk to the people you meet during trainings.
3.  Move restaurants to build your skills and get better positions. Don’t expect to spend your entire career at the same restaurant. Instead, you’ll probably have to switch restaurants to continue your rise up the career ladder. Be on the constant lookout for new positions, and apply for jobs that will help you reach your goal of becoming a chef.[\[12\]](#_note-12)
    
    [![Become a Chef Step 12.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3a/Become-a-Chef-Step-12.jpg/aid2446-v4-728px-Become-a-Chef-Step-12.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Become-a-Chef-Step-12.jpg)
    
    *   For instance, if you’re currently working as a line cook, apply for sous chef jobs at other local restaurants.
4.  Take a job as a sous chef to learn the skills to be a head chef. A sous chef works directly under a head chef, which helps you build your skills and your resume. Look for a job as a sous chef after you become a line cook. Plan to work in this position for at least 1-3 years before you rise up to a head chef position.[\[13\]](#_note-13)
    
    [![Become a Chef Step 13.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/ad/Become-a-Chef-Step-13.jpg/aid2446-v4-728px-Become-a-Chef-Step-13.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Become-a-Chef-Step-13.jpg)
    
    *   Typically, you’ll already have the knowledge and skills necessary to be a chef when you take a sous chef position. However, you might not have the kitchen experience and level of expertise to be a head chef yet, which you’ll get as a sous chef.
5.  Rise to the position of head chef when a position is available. After you've reached the position of sous chef, look for opportunities to become head chef. Keep track of restaurant openings and the career paths of the head chefs in your area. Network to meet potential job contacts who might help you get your own kitchen. When a job opens up, reach out to the restaurant owner or hiring manager and offer to show them your skills.[\[14\]](#_note-14)
    
    [![Become a Chef Step 14.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/ff/Become-a-Chef-Step-14.jpg/aid2446-v4-728px-Become-a-Chef-Step-14.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Become-a-Chef-Step-14.jpg)
    
    *   It might take several years for you to become a head chef.
    *   Making friends in the restaurant industry is the best way to get your work noticed. Be nice to everyone you meet because you never know who could help you get to your ultimate goal of being a chef.

*   Check out culinary programs at the community colleges in your area. More and more schools are offering night classes, certificate programs, and full culinary degrees.

*   Have multiple people sample your dishes. What tastes right to you may be too spicy or salty for some.
