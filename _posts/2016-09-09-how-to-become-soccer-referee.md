In order to become a soccer referee in the United States, you must first get certified by the United States Soccer Federation (USSF) so you can start refereeing youth soccer matches. After you complete the entry-level certification requirements, you’ll need to get all the necessary referee gear so that you can start officiating games. Once you have everything ready to go, it’s time to start building up experience so you can ref at progressively higher levels. Becoming a capable referee will also require some general skills such as prior knowledge of the game, a high level of fitness, and patience.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Become-a-Soccer-Referee&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Getting Certified")\]Getting Certified

1.  Contact your state’s referee association to find a USSF training course. The types of courses available vary from state to state, so look up your local referee association's website on the Internet and call or email them to get the exact details about how to enroll. Courses typically consist of either 100% either in-person clinics or a mixture of online coursework and in-person training.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   Note that this applies to becoming a certified referee in the USA. If you live in Canada or Australia, look up the specific guidelines for becoming a certified referee in your country. The processes are similar, but the associations and courses are different.
2.  Enroll in a grade 8 referee training course to become an entry-level referee. Sign up for the next available course according to the information your state’s referee association gave you. Grade 8-certified referees are qualified to referee competitive youth soccer games of all sizes and ages.[\[2\]](#_note-2)
    
    [![Become a Soccer Referee Step 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/08/Become-a-Soccer-Referee-Step-2.jpg/aid11411666-v4-728px-Become-a-Soccer-Referee-Step-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Become-a-Soccer-Referee-Step-2.jpg)
    
    *   New grade 8 referees typically start out refereeing younger games and advance in age and competitive level as they gain more experience. You will be able to upgrade your referee certification as you gain experience so you can eventually referee adult games.
    *   There is a referee registration fee of $50 USD and a clinic fee of $30 that you will have to pay when you enroll in the course.
3.  Complete the USSF referee training course to become certified. Complete any online portions of the course and attend all the in-person clinics that are required of you. You will learn all the skills needed to manage and conduct youth matches. You will have to pass a written test at the end of the course to get your certification.[\[3\]](#_note-3)
    
    [![Become a Soccer Referee Step 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c9/Become-a-Soccer-Referee-Step-3.jpg/aid11411666-v4-728px-Become-a-Soccer-Referee-Step-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Become-a-Soccer-Referee-Step-3.jpg)
    
    *   An example of a totally in-person training clinic would be 16 hours of in-person training held over the weekend for 8 hours on Saturday and 8 hours on Sunday. In a hybrid course, you would have to complete online lessons and assignments before attending a shorter 8-hour in-person clinic.
    *   In addition to learning all the rules of soccer, the course will teach you about other important things like the history of the game, the history of refereeing, and the structure of FIFA soccer.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Become-a-Soccer-Referee&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Acquiring Official Referee Equipment")\]Acquiring Official Referee Equipment

1.  Buy a gold USSF-approved referee jersey and black shoes, shorts, and socks. There are 5 approved colors of jerseys: gold, black, blue, green, and red. Gold is considered the standard color, so buy this one first. Refs always wear black shorts, socks, and turf shoes or cleats.[\[4\]](#_note-4)
    
    [![Become a Soccer Referee Step 4.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/bd/Become-a-Soccer-Referee-Step-4.jpg/aid11411666-v4-728px-Become-a-Soccer-Referee-Step-4.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Become-a-Soccer-Referee-Step-4.jpg)
    
    *   It’s a good idea to get at least 1 other color of jersey in case a team you are refereeing has gold uniforms too. Ideally, you will eventually buy 1 of each color so you have all the options available.
    *   A single referee jersey costs $25 USD and a pair of black referee shorts costs $25 USD as well. If you buy a pack of 5 jerseys at once it ends up being cheaper than buying them individually.
2.  Choose assistant soccer referee flags based on your personal taste. Checkered flags, solid flags, and diamond-pattern flags are the different options. There are no rules about which ones you can use, so pick whatever pattern and color you like.[\[5\]](#_note-5)

    *   A soccer whistle costs as little as $7 USD and up to about $50 USD for a really high-end one.
4.  Purchase a set of soccer referee cards. There are referee wallets with full sets of cards, write-on cards, and individual replacement cards. You need at least 1 red card and 1 yellow card so that you can use them to give out penalties.[\[7\]](#_note-7)

    *   A quality set of 2 cards that are weather resistant, reflective, and have good grip costs about $12 USD. Cheaper sets go for as little as $2.
    *   Yellow cards are used to indicate that you are cautioning a player and red cards are used to indicate that you are sending them off the field.
5.  Buy 2 referee watches with a timer and a start/stop function. You need 2 watches in case 1 malfunctions. Purchase 2 watches that are in your budget and that suit your style.[\[8\]](#_note-8)
    
    [![Become a Soccer Referee Step 8.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/93/Become-a-Soccer-Referee-Step-8.jpg/aid11411666-v4-728px-Become-a-Soccer-Referee-Step-8.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Become-a-Soccer-Referee-Step-8.jpg)
