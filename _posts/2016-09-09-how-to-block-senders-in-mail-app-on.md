Keep getting added to annoying email threads that spam filters just won’t catch? Use the new Block Sender feature in iOS 13 and iPadOS 13 to automatically archive new email from a particular sender in the Apple Mail app.

How to Block a Sender from Mail
-------------------------------

[iOS 13](https://www.howtogeek.com/440039/the-best-new-features-in-ios-13/) and iPadOS 13 extend the blocked contacts functionality from the [Phone](https://www.howtogeek.com/232377/how-to-manage-blocked-numbers-on-iphone/) and Messages app to the Mail app.

To get started, open the “Mail” app and find an email from the sender that you want to block. Then, tap on their Profile Picture to reveal sender details.
