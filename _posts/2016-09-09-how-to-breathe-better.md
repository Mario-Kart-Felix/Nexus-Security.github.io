Feeling like you can’t breathe well can be frightening and stressful. To help you breathe better, do breathing exercises to help you breathe deeply, calm down, and restore your natural breathing. Additionally, make lifestyle changes to improve your breathing. If you’re experiencing shortness of breath, try re-positioning your body to help you breathe easily. However, see your doctor if you’re struggling to breathe, you have breathing issues often, or you’re dealing with anxiety or panic attacks.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Breathe-Better&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Doing Breathing Exercises")\]Doing Breathing Exercises

1.  Perform abdominal breathing to take deep breaths. Lie down in a comfortable position, then place one hand on your chest and the other on your abdomen. Slowly inhale through your nose to draw air into your abdomen. Feel your abdomen rise under your hand. Then, slowly exhale through puckered lips. Repeat for 5-10 minutes.[\[1\]](#_note-1)
    
    [![Breathe Better Step 1.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4d/Breathe-Better-Step-1.jpg/aid7087689-v4-728px-Breathe-Better-Step-1.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Breathe-Better-Step-1.jpg)
    
    *   The hand on your chest shouldn’t rise during this exercise. Only your abdomen should rise.
    *   Repeat this exercise 2-3 times a day to improve your breathing.
    *   As you get used to the exercise, you can do it sitting up. Eventually, you’ll be able to do it while standing.
2.  Do rhythmic breathing to calm yourself down. Focus on slowing down your breathing by counting as you inhale, hold your breath, and exhale. Inhale as you slowly count to 5, then hold your breath for a 5 count. Next, exhale as you slowly count to 5. Repeat 5 times to help you return your breathing to its natural rhythm.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

    *   It’s okay to vary your count. For instance, you might prefer to use a 3 count instead of a 5 count. Do what feels right to you.
3.  Use alternate nostril breathing to deal with stress. Place your finger over 1 nostril to close it off. Then, slowly inhale through your open nostril until your lungs are full. Hold the breath for 1 second, then close that nostril and slowly exhale through your other nostril. Inhale through that nostril, then close it off and exhale through the first nostril.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

    *   Continue to alternate nostrils for 3-5 minutes to help restore natural breathing.
4.  Perform the 4-7-8 breathing technique to help you relax. Sit with your back straight, then place your tongue behind your teeth. Exhale through your mouth without moving your tongue to empty your lungs. Close your mouth, then inhale through your nose for a 4 count. Then, hold your breath for a 7 count. Exhale with a whoosh as you count to 8.[\[4\]](#_note-4)
    
    [![Breathe Better Step 4.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a1/Breathe-Better-Step-4.jpg/aid7087689-v4-728px-Breathe-Better-Step-4.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Breathe-Better-Step-4.jpg)
    
    *   Take a total 4 of 4-7-8 breaths to help you feel calm and relaxed.
5.  Breathe in slowly then hum on your exhale to slow your breathing. Slowly inhale through your nose until your lungs feel full. Then, make a low humming sound as you exhale through your mouth. Continue to hum until your lungs are empty. This can help you slow down your breath, which relaxes you.[\[5\]](#_note-5)
    
    [![Breathe Better Step 5.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/84/Breathe-Better-Step-5.jpg/aid7087689-v4-728px-Breathe-Better-Step-5.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Breathe-Better-Step-5.jpg)
    
    *   Repeat this for several breaths to help you slow down your breathing.
    *   If you like, say a mantra like “Om” as you exhale.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Breathe-Better&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Making Lifestyle Changes")\]Making Lifestyle Changes

1.  [Use good posture](https://www.wikihow.com/Improve-Your-Posture "Improve Your Posture") so it’s easier to breathe. Poor posture compresses your lungs and airways, making it harder for you to breathe. Improve your posture by straightening your spine when you’re sitting or standing. Additionally, roll your shoulders back and tilt your chin up. This may help you breathe better.[\[6\]](#_note-6)
    
    [![Breathe Better Step 6.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/46/Breathe-Better-Step-6.jpg/aid7087689-v4-728px-Breathe-Better-Step-6.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Breathe-Better-Step-6.jpg)
    
    *   Look in the mirror to check out your posture. Practice standing or sitting up straight until it feels natural to you.
2.  Prop yourself up if you have trouble breathing while you're sleeping. You may struggle to breathe while you're lying down, especially at night. If this happens, use pillows or a wedge to prop up your upper body. This will take some of the pressure off your lungs so you can breathe better while you sleep.[\[7\]](#_note-7)
    
    [![Breathe Better Step 7.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/51/Breathe-Better-Step-7.jpg/aid7087689-v4-728px-Breathe-Better-Step-7.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Breathe-Better-Step-7.jpg)
    
    *   You might also try putting a folded blanket under your pillow.
3.  Limit your exposure to air pollutants and irritants. Air pollution can affect your lungs and airways, making it harder for you to breathe. While you might not be able to avoid all air pollution, you can reduce your exposure to it. Here are some ways to avoid exposure to common air pollutants:[\[8\]](#_note-8)
    
    [![Breathe Better Step 8.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8b/Breathe-Better-Step-8.jpg/aid7087689-v4-728px-Breathe-Better-Step-8.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Breathe-Better-Step-8.jpg)
    
    *   Avoid spending time outdoors around pollutants.
    *   Stay away from allergens.
    *   Don’t use perfumes and colognes.
    *   Stop using air fresheners.
    *   Pick fragrance-free personal care products and cleaners.
    *   Avoid burning candles or incense.
    *   Clean your home often to prevent dust and mold.
    *   Step away when someone is smoking to avoid second-hand smoke.
4.  Do an elimination diet to help heal a leaky gut. If you're sensitive to a food you're eating, it may cause holes in your intestines that allow bacteria and food particles to escape into your body. This triggers inflammation and illness in your body as it tries to fight off the invaders. The inflammation can cause breathing issues and allergies. To help you heal, do an elimination diet to improve your gut health.[\[9\]](#_note-9)
    
    [![Breathe Better Step 9.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/26/Breathe-Better-Step-9.jpg/aid7087689-v4-728px-Breathe-Better-Step-9.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Breathe-Better-Step-9.jpg)
    
    *   Eliminate common food allergies like milk, gluten, eggs, soy, sugar, nuts, and caffeine for 3-4 weeks. Once you start to feel better, add the foods back 1 at a time to see if they affect you. Stop eating any foods that make your symptoms return.
5.  Use an air filter to improve your indoor air quality. Unfortunately, the air inside your home may be full of indoor air pollutants. This can irritate your lungs and make it harder for you to breathe well. Luckily, indoor air filters might help filter out these pollutants so you breathe easier. Use HEPA filters to improve the air quality in your home.[\[10\]](#_note-10)
    
    [![Breathe Better Step 10.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c0/Breathe-Better-Step-10.jpg/aid7087689-v4-728px-Breathe-Better-Step-10.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Breathe-Better-Step-10.jpg)
    
    *   Install HEPA filters in your air conditioning system. Additionally, you might get an air filter fan to improve the air quality.
6.  [Exercise](https://www.wikihow.com/Exercise "Exercise") for 30 minutes daily to improve your respiratory health. You might struggle to breathe after being active. Regular exercise can help you improve your physical fitness so you can breathe easier. Do 30 minutes of moderate cardio exercise at least 5-6 days a week to help you get fit. Here are some exercises you might try:[\[11\]](#_note-11)

    *   Take a dance class.
    *   Join a recreational sports team.
7.  [Stop smoking](https://www.wikihow.com/Quit-Smoking "Quit Smoking") if you do. You probably know that smoking affects your breathing, but quitting is extremely difficult. Talk to your doctor about using quitting aids to help you stop smoking. This can help you take charge of your respiratory health.[\[12\]](#_note-12)
    
    [![Breathe Better Step 12.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/01/Breathe-Better-Step-12.jpg/aid7087689-v4-728px-Breathe-Better-Step-12.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Breathe-Better-Step-12.jpg)
    
    *   For instance, your doctor might be able to give you patches, gum, or prescription medicine to help you deal with cravings. Additionally, they might help you find a support group that can help you stay strong.

    [![Breathe Better Step 14.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/52/Breathe-Better-Step-14.jpg/aid7087689-v4-728px-Breathe-Better-Step-14.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Breathe-Better-Step-14.jpg)
    
    *   For instance, you might drink warm tea or sip on warm water.
3.  Lean your hips against the wall, lean slightly forward, and relax. Stand with your back to the wall and your feet about hip-width apart. Lean slightly forward and place your hands on your thighs.

    [![Breathe Better Step 15.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8c/Breathe-Better-Step-15.jpg/aid7087689-v4-728px-Breathe-Better-Step-15.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Breathe-Better-Step-15.jpg)
    
    *   You should breathe easier in 2-3 minutes.
4.  Do pursed lip breathing if you’ve been active or anxious. Pursed lip breathing can help you ease shortness of breath caused by strenuous activity or anxiety.[\[16\]](#_note-16) Start by closing your mouth and slowly inhaling through your nose for a 2 count. Pucker your lips like you’re about to whistle, then slowly blow out the air to a count of 4. Repeat until your breathing returns to normal.[\[17\]](#_note-17)
    
    [![Breathe Better Step 16.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8f/Breathe-Better-Step-16.jpg/aid7087689-v4-728px-Breathe-Better-Step-16.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Breathe-Better-Step-16.jpg)
    
    *   You should feel better after 2-3 minutes of pursed lip breathing. If you don’t, you may need to try a different breathing exercise or you might need medical care.
    *   Incorporate pursed lip breathing into your daily routine to help control chronic breathing issues. Do it 4-5 times a day for 1-2 minutes to help you breathe better.
5.  Sleep on your side with a pillow between your knees. You might experience shortness of breath while you’re sleeping, especially if you’re sick or snore. To help yourself breathe better, turn onto your side to sleep. Place pillows under your head to prop up your upper body and put a pillow between your legs to align your spine.[\[18\]](#_note-18)
    
    [![Breathe Better Step 17.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e4/Breathe-Better-Step-17.jpg/aid7087689-v4-728px-Breathe-Better-Step-17.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Breathe-Better-Step-17.jpg)
    
    *   If you have a tendency to roll into a different position, use blankets or pillows to prevent you from rolling over.
