Anyone whoâ€™s tried to use a small, cheap wet/dry shop vac to suck up significant amounts of water quickly discovers how ill-suited such vacuums are to the task. I have the Harbor Freight 5-gallon wet/dry vac, and I would never think to use it to suck up more than the most minor of spills.

To address this deficiency, [Chris Notap](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrnCSQJB4c1_rOKJRzSZemg) has come up with a simple buck buddy container for collecting water using a 5-gallon Home Depot bucket and some basic ABS plumbing parts. No more needing to convert your vac over to wet mode or having to carry your precariously full vacuum to the sink or outdoors.
