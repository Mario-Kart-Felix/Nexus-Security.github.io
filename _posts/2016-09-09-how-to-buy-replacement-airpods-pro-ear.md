There are multiple ways to obtain replacement AirPods Pro ear tips, including ordering them online, contacting Apple by phone or online chat, or booking an appointment with a Genius Bar at an Apple Store:  
  
  

1.  Navigate to **[getsupport.apple.com](http://getsupport.apple.com)**.  
      
      
    
2.  Select **AirPods**.  
      
      
    
3.  Select **Lost or Missing AirPods**.  
      
      
    
4.  Select **Replace your AirPods Pro ear tips**.  
      
      
    
5.  Choose from one of four options: **Order Replacements** for online ordering, **Chat** for online chat, **Talk to Apple Support Now** for a phone call, or **Make an Appointment at a Store** for a Genius Bar appointment.

If you choose the **Order Replacements** option, you will be prompted to enter your Apple ID email address and password and complete two-factor authentication if necessary. Then you will be presented with a list of your Apple products. If your AirPods Pro are not shown, enter their serial number at the bottom of the page and select Continue.

If you choose the **Make an Appointment at a Store** option, you will be prompted to enter your Apple ID email address and password and complete two-factor authentication if necessary. After entering your location, select an Apple Store from the list and confirm an appointment time. Apple requests bringing a valid government-issued photo ID to your appointment for verification.  
  
  
  
  
  
Apple says replacement AirPods Pro ear tips take 3-5 business days to arrive. If you need them sooner, opt for a Genius Bar appointment. The replacement tips only come in the one size you select, so choose carefully.
