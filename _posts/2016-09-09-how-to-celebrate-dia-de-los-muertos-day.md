Día de los Muertos, also known as the _Day of the Dead_ is a holiday celebrated in Latin American countries and is especially popular in Mexico. This special holiday, celebrated on November 1st and 2nd each year, honors the lives of people who have died. It is believed that the souls of the dead come back to visit their loved ones at this time. Contrary to popular belief, Día de los Muertos is not a sad or depressing time, but a time of happiness and celebration of life!

1.  [Make an altar](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-an-Altar "Create an Altar") for the deceased. You can create an altar for just one person or an altar for many people. Fill the altar with favorite foods and trinkets that the people enjoyed in their lifetime. Decorate it with candles, flowers, and a framed photo of the person or people you are remembering. Spend time at the altar, telling fond and humorous stories about the deceased.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   Many people choose to pray, and add a Christian cross and statues or pictures of the Blessed Virgin Mary to the altar.
    *   Catrina figures (a costumed female with a skeleton face) are popular decorations for altars.
2.  Visit the graves of your loved ones. Clean and decorate the grave with ofrendas (offerings) like "cempasúchitl" (orange marigolds) or "Flor de Muerto" ("Flower of the Dead"), which are thought to attract souls of the dead. You can even make a path from flower petals from the grave to your home to help your loved ones find their way. Lay down trinkets and the deceased's favorite candies.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

    *   Usually, deceased children are honored on November 1, while deceased adults are honored on November 2.
    *   For children (_los angelitos_ or little angels) bring toys and sugar skulls; for adults, bring bottles of their favorite alcoholic beverage (tequila, mezcal, pulque).
    *   You can visit the graves of your loved ones any time during the holiday, or even spend all night in the cemetery eating, drinking, talking, playing cards, and listening to music.
3.  Set out pillows and blankets in your home. Traditionally, people celebrating Día de los Muertos arrange a pillow and blanket for each of their deceased loved ones in their home. This is so that the spirits of the dead can rest after their journey, as they are believed to visit their loved ones during this time.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

4.  Play music. Listen to live mariachi music or play your loved one’s favorite songs or recordings. Enjoy the music and celebrate the life of the deceased. Some people even have parades through the graveyard, and play music, dance, and celebrate while stopping at the gravestones of each of their loved ones.[\[4\]](#_note-4)

5.  Write calaveras literarias. Calaveras literarias (“literary skulls”), also known as panteones, are short poems written in the form of epitaphs. These poems are satirical or funny, and often poke fun at your loved ones’ quirks or embarrassing moments. You can even illustrate your poem with pictures of your loved one or of Dapper Death and his Dame.[\[5\]](#_note-5)
    
    [![Celebrate Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) Step 5 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c7/Celebrate-D%C3%ADa-de-los-Muertos-%28Day-of-the-Dead%29-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid75603-v4-728px-Celebrate-D%C3%ADa-de-los-Muertos-%28Day-of-the-Dead%29-Step-5-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Celebrate-D%C3%ADa-de-los-Muertos-(Day-of-the-Dead)-Step-5-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   Traditionally, calaveras literarias were written in four-line stanzas in which the second line rhymes with the last line, or five-line stanzas in which the third line rhymes with the last line. In modern times, many of these poems are written in blank verse and are no longer than one page.[\[6\]](#_note-6)
    *   For instance, if your loved one was a poor bullfighter, you could write a short poem in which they struggle or fail during a bullfight. Humor often plays a large role in the calaveras literarias.
6.  Make [Day of the Dead masks](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Day-of-the-Dead-Mask "Make a Day of the Dead Mask"). This is a great activity for children on Día de los Muertos. Draw a skull or trace a template you find online. Decorate the mask in a traditional style, or create your own designs. Cut out the mask, punch a hole on either side, and attach a string to each hole. Tie the mask around your head and head out to celebrate.[\[7\]](#_note-7)

    *   Masks can be either half- or full-face. Traditional designs include skulls and flowers.
    *   You can use crayons, markers, puffy paint, glitter glue, etc., to decorate your mask as you wish.
7.  Wear [Day of the Dead makeup](https://www.wikihow.com/Apply-Day-of-the-Dead-Makeup "Apply Day of the Dead Makeup"). Many people like to wear makeup that is reminiscent of a sugar skull on the Day of the Dead. Paint your face white, then add large colored circles around your eyes. You can draw “stitches” on your lips and extending out from your mouth. Paint on a nose, and add decorations like flowers or spiderwebs to your face.[\[8\]](#_note-8)

8.  Dress in costume for the holiday. Nowadays, many people wear items of clothing decorated with sugar skulls or skeleton prints, such as shirts, dresses, or leggings on Día de los Muertos. You can also wear shells and dance so that the noisiness "wakes up" the dead, or even dress up as the deceased.[\[9\]](#_note-9)

    *   Some women also dress as Calavera Catrina in long, flowing, brightly-colored lace dresses paired with flower crowns and sugar skull makeup.
    *   Sometimes, children dress in costume and ask people on the street for a _calaverita_ (a small gift of money). Unlike Halloween, though, they don't knock on doors.

2.  Create [calaveras](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Calaveras-for-D%C3%ADa-de-los-Muertos "Make Calaveras for Día de los Muertos"). Calaveras are Mexican sugar skulls. This is a fun activity for the whole family, and especially fun to eat, as calaveras are offered to both the living and the dead. To make your own, mix 1 teaspoon (4.93 mL) of meringue powder with 1 cup (237 mL) of granulated sugar, then add 1 teaspoon (4.93 mL) of water, and mix well. Pack the mixture into a mold and let dry overnight.[\[11\]](#_note-11)

    *   You can also buy the sugar skulls "ready made" and then decorate them.
3.  Make calabaza en tacha. Calabaza en tacha (candied pumpkin) is a popular and traditional dish for Día de los Muertos. In a large saucepan, bring 2 pounds (0.907 kg) piloncillo, 4 cinnamon sticks, 4 cups (1 liter) of water, and the juice and zest from 1 orange to a boil. Add the flesh of one 5-pound (2.25 kg) pumpkin, cut into strips. Simmer an hour or two until tender, then serve.[\[12\]](#_note-12)

    *   Piloncillo is Mexican unrefined brown sugar; to substitute, you can mix 2 teaspoons (9.86 mL) molasses with every 1/4 cup (59 mL) of brown sugar.
    *   This recipe yields 6-8 servings of calabaza en tacha.
4.  Serve atole. Atole is a warm porridge-like drink made from masa. To make it, blend 1/2 cup (118 mL) fresh masa with 1/4 cup (59 mL) hot water. Transfer it to saucepan, add a cinnamon stick and the seeds from one vanilla bean, and stir until it thickens. Mix in 3-4 tablespoons (44-59 mL) piloncillo until it dissolves, then remove from heat. Remove the cinnamon stick and vanilla bean seeds.[\[13\]](#_note-13)

    *   This recipe yields 5-6 servings of atole.
5.  Mix the dough for pan de muerto. Pan de muerto ("bread of the dead") is a sweet egg bread made in various shapes. This is a traditional Día de Los Muertos dish and is a fun activity for the family to do together. To make it:[\[14\]](#_note-14)

    *   Add 2 large eggs and 1 cup (237 mL) flour and mix well with a wooden spoon.
    *   Add 1 ¼ cups (296 mL) flour, in small increments, stirring well until the dough comes together.

    *   To make a skull, remove 3 tablespoons (44.36 mL) of dough and form each into a ball. Shape the larger dough into a loaf.
    *   Roll 2 of the balls into long worm shapes to form the bones on top of the bread. Drape the 2 worms-shaped dough pieces on top of the loaf to form an “X.”
    *   Form the remaining ball into a skeleton head and gently place it on top of the “X.”
8.  Bake your pan de muerto. Place the loaf on the prepared baking sheet and allow it to rise in warm place for about 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176.6 degrees C).

    *   Brush the top of the loaf with egg wash made from 1 egg yolk beaten with 2 teaspoons (9.86 mL) water.
    *   Bake for 20 minutes; then remove the loaf from the oven and brush again with egg wash. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon (14.79 mL) granulated sugar.
    *   Return it to the oven and bake for about 20 minutes or until loaf is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped. Serve warm or cool completely.
