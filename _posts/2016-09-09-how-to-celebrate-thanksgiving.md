*   Choose simple Thanksgiving recipes if this is your first time preparing the Thanksgiving holiday meal.
*   If you are hosting guests, ensure that all health and dietary needs are met for the meal. Take into consideration guests with certain food allergies or dietary restrictions. For example, provide a tofu turkey for your [vegetarian](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Vegetarian-Thanksgiving-Dinner "Make a Vegetarian Thanksgiving Dinner") guests.
*   If you have little kids, make sure you can see them at all times. Be sure that they didn't wander into the kitchen, as that could be dangerous.
*   You can bake the traditional pumpkin pie, or you can use cherry pie, french silk... Any kind will do!
