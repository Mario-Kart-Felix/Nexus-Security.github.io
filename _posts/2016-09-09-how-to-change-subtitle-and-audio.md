Recently, I have been playing around Apple TV+, exploring everything that [Apple’s streaming service has got](https://beebom.com/apple-tv-plus-complete-show-movies-list/). While I have already jotted down the [best tips and tricks for Apple TV+](https://beebom.com/best-tips-tricks-apple-tv-app/), one nifty hack failed to catch my eyes. It is about changing subtitle or audio language. Considering how user-friendly this feature is, I thought it would be better to cover it separately. So, if you prefer to have subtitles or wish to change the language in the Apple TV app or Apple TV+, this quick hands-on guide is for you.  

Change Subtitle & Audio Language in Apple TV App/Apple TV+ on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Smart TVs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

There are a couple of ways to select the desired subtitle or audio language. You can get it done right from inside the app. Just in case, you want to set it for all other video-streaming apps, you can do so by navigating to the Settings of your specific device. In what could play a vital role in amping up your binge-watching, there is also a way to bring some customization into the play. That said, let’s find out how it’s done the right way!  

### Change Subtitle & Audio Language in Apple TV On iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch

  

1\. Open the **Apple TV app** and play your favorite content. While playing the movie, **tap on the screen** to access the **playback controls.**

So, that’s the quick way to select your preferred subtitle or audio language in the Apple TV app. As the feature is quite user-friendly, it’s good that Apple has offered a straightforward way to change it – rather than forcing users to do it from the settings app of the specific device.
