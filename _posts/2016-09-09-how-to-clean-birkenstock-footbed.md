It is easy to avoid stains in your Birkenstock footbeds, and there are a number of steps you can take to remove dirt, grime, and smell to get your sandals back in shape.

1.  Combine baking soda and water into a smooth paste. Mixing 2 tablespoons of water with 1 tablespoon of baking soda will create a smooth paste. To remove heavy stains, spread the mixture onto the footbed, then gently scrub it using a soft brush.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   An old toothbrush works great as a soft and gentle alternative to a true suede brush.
2.  Let the cleaning solution work overnight. For tough, persistent stains, it may be helpful to allow a small amount of the baking soda and water paste to sit in the footbed overnight. When you wake up, rinse the footbed out and wipe it down fully with a soft cloth before allowing it to dry. [\[2\]](#_note-2)

3.  Dry the Birkenstocks in a cool place. It is important to keep them away from direct sunlight at all times, keeping in mind that high heat can cause damage the cork sole, footbed, and straps. Let the shoes dry for 24 hours after cleaning to avoid the possibility of dry rot or cracking.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

    *   A good choice for mild soap would be dish soap, which is gentle enough to be used on food surfaces.
2.  Brush the footbed gently. Use a soft brush or cloth to remove the stains. Reapply the soap and water anywhere that there are stains and carefully wash them away. If stains remain, they may be too tough for soap.[\[6\]](#_note-6)

1.  Brush the footbed out regularly. By using a soft brush or a slightly damp cloth to remove debris, you can avoid dirty footbeds. Doing this once every few weeks will keep the footbed from getting grimy sole imprints and scuff marks.[\[8\]](#_note-8)

    *   Dirt and grass are especially likely to stain and discolor the footbed.
2.  Remove mud promptly. If an unexpected downpour leads to mud in the footbeds, be sure to wipe them down with a dampened cloth before putting them away for the night. Letting them dry overnight is enough for simple cleanings. [\[9\]](#_note-9)
