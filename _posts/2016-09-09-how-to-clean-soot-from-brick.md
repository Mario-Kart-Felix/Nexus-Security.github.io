A fireplace can be a cozy addition to any home, but one of the inevitable byproducts is soot on the surrounding bricks. Soot can leave lasting stains on the material it comes in contact with, so it’s important to clean this buildup at least once a year. To clean soot from your brick, stick with using baking soda or white vinegar for a natural solution, or use a chemical cleaner like TSP to make your bricks clean again.

    *   If you use your fireplace for heat, consider cleaning it during the summer months when you won’t need to use it as much.
2.  Remove the ashes and loose soot. Use a brush and dustpan to [clean your fireplace](https://www.wikihow.com/Clean-a-Fireplace "Clean a Fireplace") out before you start scrubbing it. Throw away any ashes or large pieces of charred wood that may be in the fireplace. This will make your cleaning process much easier.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

    *   You can set aside wood that has not been burned to use later.
3.  Lay a drop cloth or towels down to protect your floors. As you clean, you may drip water or chemicals on the floor around your fireplace. Lay down a protective covering on your floors surrounding your fireplace to make sure you don’t damage your carpet or hardwood.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Clean-Soot-from-Brick&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Using Baking Soda")\]Using Baking Soda

1.  Make a paste of a 1:1 ratio of water and baking soda. Combine 4 tbsp (56 g) of baking soda with of warm water. Stir the ingredients together until they form a thick paste. If your mixture is too runny, add more baking soda.[\[5\]](#_note-5)

2.  Rub the mixture into the bricks with your hands. Scoop large amounts of your baking soda paste and spread it onto your fireplace. Work from the top down to create a thin layer all over the brick face. Spread extra paste on the inside of the fireplace, since that is where the soot will be the thickest. Pay special attention to the crevices and grooves in between bricks. Focus on any areas of the fireplace are particularly dirty.[\[6\]](#_note-6)

    *   Put on rubber kitchen gloves to protect your hands, or use a clean rag to spread the paste instead.
3.  Let the paste sit for 10 minutes. The baking soda will work to break down grease and grime on your bricks. Allow the paste to sit for about 10 minutes to loosen up the soot. Do not let the paste dry or harden all the way, or it could damage your bricks.[\[7\]](#_note-7)

    *   If your paste does get too dry, spray it with water to loosen it up again.
4.  Scrub the mixture away with an abrasive scrub brush. Use a scrub brush with hard bristles to scrub away the mixture. Dip your brush in water occasionally to wash away the baking soda residue. The mildly abrasive baking soda will work with your brush to scrub away tough soot.[\[8\]](#_note-8)

    *   Do not brush so hard that you damage the bricks themselves.
5.  Wipe down your bricks with warm water and remove the drop cloths. Use a soft sponge dipped in warm water to completely remove any baking soda left on your bricks. Let the fireplace dry completely before you use it again. Remove any drop cloths or towels you put down to catch spills.[\[9\]](#_note-9)

    *   You can buy empty spray bottles at most home goods and hardware stores.
2.  Spray the inside and outside of the fireplace with the vinegar solution. Working from the top down, spray your vinegar solution all over the bricks. Pay special attention to areas that have a lot of soot, which could be right around the opening of the fireplace. Make sure you have a drop cloth down to catch any drips.[\[11\]](#_note-11)
    
    [![Clean Soot from Brick Step 11 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/dc/Clean-Soot-from-Brick-Step-11-Version-3.jpg/aid1409347-v4-728px-Clean-Soot-from-Brick-Step-11-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Clean-Soot-from-Brick-Step-11-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   If you have leftover vinegar solution, you can use it as a natural cleaner for bathrooms and countertops.
3.  Let the mixture sit for 10 minutes. Vinegar is mildly acidic, so it will work to break down the soot and grime stuck onto your bricks. Let the vinegar and water sit on your bricks, but do not let it dry. Don’t let it sit for longer than 10 minutes, or the acidity could start to damage your bricks.[\[12\]](#_note-12)

4.  Scrub the bricks from the top down with a scrub brush. Dip your scrub brush in warm water and scrub your bricks. Pay special attention to the grooves in between bricks and any areas that have a lot of soot. Scrub at the bricks until the vinegar smell is no longer there.[\[13\]](#_note-13)

    *   You can sprinkle baking soda over your bricks to remove the vinegar faster. However, this will cause a foaming reaction on your bricks and could create a mess.
5.  Clean your bricks with warm water and remove the drop cloths. Use a soft sponge to quickly spread warm water over all your bricks. Take away any drop cloths or towels you used on the floor around your fireplace. Let your fireplace dry completely before you burn anything in it again.[\[14\]](#_note-14)
