Whether you don't have access to a sink or shower or you just need a quick clean, there are several ways to help clean your hair without using water. Sprinkle baby powder on your hair to absorb the oil, or dab your hair with rubbing alcohol to dry out greasy locks. Dry shampoo is always a great alternative to washing your hair when you're in a pinch, too. If you don't have access to any of these fixes, try hiding your dirty hair by styling it with something like a headband, ponytail, or braids.

1.  Sprinkle your hair with baby powder to absorb oil on your roots. If you happen to have baby powder at home, this is a great way to mask extra oil and grime in your hair without washing it. Either sprinkle the baby powder right onto your roots, or use a clean makeup brush to swipe it over your roots instead. Wait a couple minutes before massaging it into your hair.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   Apply the baby powder using 2-3 shakes to avoid sprinkling too much on your hair. If your hair is longer or super thick, you may need 3-5 shakes of the container to cover your hair.
2.  [Spray dry shampoo](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Dry-Shampoo "Use Dry Shampoo") on your hair for a quick fix. Dry shampoo is great for absorbing oil when you don’t have time to wash your hair thoroughly. Spray the dry shampoo at least away from your head and let it sit for a few minutes before massaging it into your hair.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

    *   Brush through your hair after you’ve let the dry shampoo sit to help distribute it evenly throughout your hair.
    *   Look for dry shampoo in your favorite brand or scent at your local grocery or big box store.
3.  Apply rubbing alcohol to your roots to fix greasy hair. Soak a cotton ball in rubbing alcohol and dab it onto your roots gently. The rubbing alcohol will help soak up any oil and grease so that your hair looks cleaner.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

    *   Alcohol dries out your hair, so use a leave-in conditioner on your hair after using this method to add moisture back to your hair.
4.  Try out a foam shampoo for a more thorough cleaning. Foam shampoos are known for helping clean dirty hair instead of just absorbing excess oil. Apply the foam shampoo to dry hair and watch it foam up, using as much as is recommended on the bottle. Use a clean towel to wipe the foam off of your hair to reveal cleaner locks without using water.[\[4\]](#_note-4)
    
    [![Clean Your Hair Without Water Step 4.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/db/Clean-Your-Hair-Without-Water-Step-4.jpg/aid11570812-v4-728px-Clean-Your-Hair-Without-Water-Step-4.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Clean-Your-Hair-Without-Water-Step-4.jpg)
    
    *   Foam shampoos are great for people with curly hair because it enhances your natural texture.
    *   Look for a foam shampoo at your local big box store or online.
5.  Dab blotting paper over your hair to absorb oil quickly. The same blotting papers you might use to absorb oil on your face can be used to absorb the oil in your hair as well. Take a blotting paper and dab it on your hair starting at your roots to absorb the oil, using multiple papers if necessary.[\[5\]](#_note-5)

    *   Blotting papers can be found at your local drugstore, grocery store, or big box store.
6.  Mix cornstarch with cocoa powder together as a dry shampoo alternative. The cornstarch will absorb oils and unwanted scents from your hair, while the cocoa powder can be mixed in if you have darker hair so the starch doesn't stand out as much. Combine of cornstarch with of cocoa powder. Mix them together thoroughly before sprinkling it over your roots.[\[6\]](#_note-6)

    *   For an easy sprinkling process, mix the two ingredients in a jar and poke holes in the top for the mixture to come out.
7.  Massage arrowroot into your hair for a natural oil absorbent. Start with of powder or a little less, sprinkling it into your palm. Massage the arrowroot powder into your hair starting at your roots and working your way down the length of your hair to absorb the oil.[\[7\]](#_note-7)

    *   You can find arrowroot at some local grocery stores, in big box stores, or online.
    *   It's best to use a damp washcloth to remove the excess powder by swiping the washcloth or towel over your hair.
8.  Swipe a dryer sheet over your hair to clean it while adding freshness. You might have used a dryer sheet to get rid of static in your hair before, but it can also be used to revive your hair if it hasn't been washed in a while. Rub a new dryer sheet over your hair gently, or press it down into a brush and brush over your hair to ensure each strand is swiped by the dryer sheet.[\[8\]](#_note-8)

    *   The dryer sheet will leave your hair smelling fresher.

1.  [Tie your hair up in a ponytail](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-High-Ponytail "Make a High Ponytail") to get dirty hair out of your face. If you’re tired of your oily hair hanging down around your face, brush through it a couple times before pulling it into a ponytail. Since your hair is greasy, it’ll be easier to get a smooth ponytail, and you can even add a colorful scrunchie to finish off the look.[\[9\]](#_note-9)
    
    [![Clean Your Hair Without Water Step 9.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6c/Clean-Your-Hair-Without-Water-Step-9.jpg/aid11570812-v4-728px-Clean-Your-Hair-Without-Water-Step-9.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Clean-Your-Hair-Without-Water-Step-9.jpg)
    
    *   Pull your hair into a high ponytail or one right at the back of your head.
2.  [Use a headband](https://www.wikihow.com/Wear-a-Headband "Wear a Headband") to hide your dirty roots. If you’re pressed for time and need a quick fix, throw on a headband that matches your outfit. This will make your hair look styled while keeping your dirty hair out of your face.[\[10\]](#_note-10)
    
    [![Clean Your Hair Without Water Step 10.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9c/Clean-Your-Hair-Without-Water-Step-10.jpg/aid11570812-v4-728px-Clean-Your-Hair-Without-Water-Step-10.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Clean-Your-Hair-Without-Water-Step-10.jpg)
    
    *   Pick out a plastic headband with teeth to keep your hair pulled back, or opt for a fabric headband to hide more of your hair.
3.  Clip back your hair into a twist to hide stringy hair. If you have dirty strands of hair near your face and want them out of the way, create a twist with the front section of each side. Use a barrette or bobby pin to clip back each of these two sections, keeping stringy, oily hair out of your face.[\[11\]](#_note-11)
    
    [![Clean Your Hair Without Water Step 11.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0f/Clean-Your-Hair-Without-Water-Step-11.jpg/aid11570812-v4-728px-Clean-Your-Hair-Without-Water-Step-11.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Clean-Your-Hair-Without-Water-Step-11.jpg)
    
    *   Create the twist as long or as short as you’d like, making sure it’s secured by a pin so it doesn’t come loose.
4.  Put your hair up in a half bun for a stylish fix. Pull back the top layer of your hair into a bun on top of your head, securing it with an elastic or hair tie. This will help hide dirty roots and keep your hair out of your face so it doesn’t get even dirtier.[\[12\]](#_note-12)
    
    [![Clean Your Hair Without Water Step 12.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/cd/Clean-Your-Hair-Without-Water-Step-12.jpg/aid11570812-v4-728px-Clean-Your-Hair-Without-Water-Step-12.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Clean-Your-Hair-Without-Water-Step-12.jpg)
    
    *   If your hair still looks stringy after putting half of it up in a bun, consider throwing all of your hair into a simple bun on top of your head.
5.  Braid your hair to disguise dirty hair completely. Create two [Dutch braids](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Dutch-Braid "Make a Dutch Braid") in your hair, [French braid](https://www.wikihow.com/French-Braid "French Braid") your hair, or even make one simple [braid](https://www.wikihow.com/Braid-Hair "Braid Hair") going down the back of your head. The tighter the braid you create, the better you’ll hide any greasy or oily locks of hair.[\[13\]](#_note-13)
    
    [![Clean Your Hair Without Water Step 13.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e1/Clean-Your-Hair-Without-Water-Step-13.jpg/aid11570812-v4-728px-Clean-Your-Hair-Without-Water-Step-13.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Clean-Your-Hair-Without-Water-Step-13.jpg)
    
    *   Brush through your hair before braiding it to ensure your braids are sleek and unknotted.
    *   Secure your braids with small hair ties so they don’t come undone.
6.  Wear a hat to cover up your hair if it's too short to be styled. If you don't have time to style your hair or your hair is super short, throw on your favorite hat to cover up greasy roots. This could be a baseball cap, beret, beanie, or even a bandana to cover the top of your head.[\[14\]](#_note-14)
