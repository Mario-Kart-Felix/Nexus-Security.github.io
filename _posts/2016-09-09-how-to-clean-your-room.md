Cleaning your room can feel like an overwhelming task, but it is likely a quicker and easier process than you imagine! Play music, write a list, give yourself rewards, and make it into a game to keep yourself motivated. Tackle the big tasks first and then move onto deep-cleaning your room by dusting, wiping and vacuuming all of the surfaces. Before you know it, your room will be sparkling clean.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Clean-Your-Room&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Keeping Motivated")\]Keeping Motivated

1.  Play upbeat music to keep your spirits high. Before you start, put on an album or playlist that makes you feel energetic. Music with a faster beat will help to get you motivated for your cleaning project. Stay away from more slow, dreary music, as this can make you feel tired and bored.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

2.  Create a reward for yourself to give you an incentive to get the job done. This extra motivation can help you to get the job done faster. Decide what you will do to treat yourself once you have finished cleaning. Maybe you will go hang out with your friends, watch a movie with your family, eat a big bowl of ice cream, or read your favorite book.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

    *   Make sure not to rush your cleaning in order to get your reward!
3.  Make cleaning your room into a game if you need extra motivation. If you're having trouble motivating yourself to clean your room, make the process interesting by playing a game. See how many things you can put away during 10 minutes and then try to beat your high score. Alternatively, pretend that you are a robot while you are cleaning and only make robot movements and noises. Another option is to set a timer and see how fast you can clean your room.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

    *   Be creative and create your own games!
4.  Create a checklist of all the different tasks to keep your cleaning on track. Checklists are a great way to give yourself a sense of achievement and progress when you are cleaning up a big mess. Decide what you want to organize and clean, and then prioritize them from the highest priority to the lowest priority. Try to be as detailed as you can so that nothing gets forgotten.[\[4\]](#_note-4)

    *   Tick off each task once you have done it so that you can easily keep track of what you still need to do.
5.  Schedule the tasks throughout the week to make it more manageable. This is a great option if there is a lot to clean. Write down when you will complete each task so that you can stay on track with your cleaning schedule. Try to be as disciplined as possible and stick to the schedule.[\[5\]](#_note-5)

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Clean-Your-Room&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Tackling the Major Tasks")\]Tackling the Major Tasks

1.  Move everything off your bed and [make it](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Your-Bed "Make Your Bed"). Making your bed helps to make your room look much cleaner and will give you a feeling of achievement to kickstart your cleaning. Move anything from on your bed into a pile in one section of your room. Pull up your sheets and blankets, tuck them in, straighten your comforter, and place your pillows at the top of your bed.[\[6\]](#_note-6)
    
    [![Clean Your Room Step 6 Version 4.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/10/Clean-Your-Room-Step-6-Version-4.jpg/aid40273-v4-728px-Clean-Your-Room-Step-6-Version-4.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Clean-Your-Room-Step-6-Version-4.jpg)
    
    *   If you haven’t changed your sheets recently, place them in the washing basket and put new ones on your bed. This will help your bed to feel and smell extra fresh.
2.  Organize all of the clothes that are on your floor. Pick up each piece of clothing and decide whether it is dirty or not. If in doubt, treat it as if it is dirty! If the item is clean, fold it and place it in your dresser or hang it up in your wardrobe. If the item is dirty, place it in the washing basket.[\[7\]](#_note-7)
    
    [![Clean Your Room Step 7 Version 4.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/11/Clean-Your-Room-Step-7-Version-4.jpg/aid40273-v4-728px-Clean-Your-Room-Step-7-Version-4.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Clean-Your-Room-Step-7-Version-4.jpg)
    
3.  Take any dirty dishes to the kitchen. This helps to prevent bad smells from forming and helps to stop ants and other pests from gathering in your room. Take all the cups, plates, cutlery, and mugs back to the kitchen. Also, throw away any takeout packages that are still in your room.[\[8\]](#_note-8)
    
    [![Clean Your Room Step 8 Version 4.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/58/Clean-Your-Room-Step-8-Version-4.jpg/aid40273-v4-728px-Clean-Your-Room-Step-8-Version-4.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Clean-Your-Room-Step-8-Version-4.jpg)
    
    *   Check under your bed, on your dresser and desk, and in your bedside drawers for dirty dishes and takeout packages.
4.  Throw any rubbish into a garbage bag. This is a great way to clear space in your room and get rid of clutter. Sort through all the objects on the surfaces in your room and on your floor and decide if anything needs to be thrown away. Look out for food wrappers, apple cores, random bits of paper, and broken items.[\[9\]](#_note-9)
    
    [![Clean Your Room Step 9 Version 4.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a3/Clean-Your-Room-Step-9-Version-4.jpg/aid40273-v4-728px-Clean-Your-Room-Step-9-Version-4.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Clean-Your-Room-Step-9-Version-4.jpg)
    
    *   Donate any quality items that you don’t want anymore to a second-hand charity store.
    *   Put unwanted paper and cardboard into a separate bag for recycling.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Clean-Your-Room&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Organizing the Items in Your Room")\]Organizing the Items in Your Room

1.  Place objects back in their rightful places if they already have a home. Put everything that's on the floor away first. That way, you'll be able to move around your room without tripping over anything. Start with the bigger things, like books and pillows, then move onto smaller things, like pencils and other stationery. Find a home for all the items on your dresser, desk, floor, and bedside tables.[\[10\]](#_note-10)
    
    [![Clean Your Room Step 10 Version 4.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/16/Clean-Your-Room-Step-10-Version-4.jpg/aid40273-v4-728px-Clean-Your-Room-Step-10-Version-4.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Clean-Your-Room-Step-10-Version-4.jpg)
    
    *   Try not to get distracted by the items you are putting away, as this can make your cleaning process take a lot longer.
2.  Store similar items that don’t have a home in boxes. This is a simple way to organize your room and make it easier to find things. Place all your stationary in 1 box, your photos in another box, your beauty products in another box, craft supplies in another box, and so on. Make sure to label the boxes and store them in an accessible place so that they are easy to find and access.[\[11\]](#_note-11)
    
    [![Clean Your Room Step 11 Version 4.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2b/Clean-Your-Room-Step-11-Version-4.jpg/aid40273-v4-728px-Clean-Your-Room-Step-11-Version-4.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Clean-Your-Room-Step-11-Version-4.jpg)
    
    *   Place the boxes on your shelves, under your bed, in your wardrobe, or on your desk.
3.  Display a few items that are special to you. This is a great way to personalize your room. If you find a pretty ornament or cool toy while you are cleaning, consider placing it on your desk, dresser, or bedside table as a feature. Try to only place a few items on each surface so that the space doesn't look cluttered.[\[12\]](#_note-12)
    
    [![Clean Your Room Step 12 Version 4.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8d/Clean-Your-Room-Step-12-Version-4.jpg/aid40273-v4-728px-Clean-Your-Room-Step-12-Version-4.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Clean-Your-Room-Step-12-Version-4.jpg)
    
    *   Using your space as a display area will help you keep the room tidier, since objects that don’t belong will look out of place and you’ll be encouraged to put them away. Additionally, when surfaces have less clutter on them, they’re easier to clean and dust.
4.  Give away any books, clothes, or toys that you don’t want anymore. This is a great way to declutter your room and will give you more space for the items that you treasure. Look at each object and consider whether you have used it in the last year. If you haven’t used it recently and it doesn’t have sentimental value, think about giving it away to a second-hand charity shop.[\[13\]](#_note-13)

    *   Make sure to check with your parents first.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Clean-Your-Room&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Cleaning the Surfaces")\]Cleaning the Surfaces

1.  [Dust](https://www.wikihow.com/Dust-Your-Entire-House "Dust Your Entire House") all of the surfaces in your room. Use a duster to remove all the dust from your desk, dresser, bookshelf, slatted blinds, fans, light fixtures, lamps, and any other surfaces you may have in your room. Always start high and work your way down, so that you don’t knock dust and dirt onto surfaces you’ve already cleaned. Dust before you vacuum or sweep, because often dust will become displaced and then settle back on your floor.[\[14\]](#_note-14)
    
    [![Clean Your Room Step 14 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/37/Clean-Your-Room-Step-14-Version-3.jpg/aid40273-v4-728px-Clean-Your-Room-Step-14-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Clean-Your-Room-Step-14-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   If you don’t have a duster, use a microfiber cloth to remove the dust.
    *   Make sure to dust objects on your desk, dresser, etc. Picture-frames, travel souvenirs, and trophies will look much nicer when they are dust-free.
    *   Ensure that your fan and lights are turned off before you dust them.
2.  Wipe the surfaces to remove marks, dust, and stickiness. Stickiness can attract ants and can damage your furniture. Spray a little surface cleaner onto the surfaces and wipe them with a cloth. Microfiber cloths are a great option, as they easily remove a variety of different marks. Wipe your desk, dresser, bedside table, window sills, baseboards, trims, and any other surfaces in your room at least once a week.[\[15\]](#_note-15)
    
    [![Clean Your Room Step 15 Version 4.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d7/Clean-Your-Room-Step-15-Version-4.jpg/aid40273-v4-728px-Clean-Your-Room-Step-15-Version-4.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Clean-Your-Room-Step-15-Version-4.jpg)
    
    *   Disinfectant wipes also work well, as they help to kill any bacteria that may have grown on your room’s surfaces.
3.  [Vacuum](https://www.wikihow.com/Vacuum-a-Room "Vacuum a Room") the floor, especially under your bed and desk. These areas are often missed during quick cleans, so make sure to vacuum them thoroughly. If necessary, move furniture so that you can vacuum under it more easily. Push your vacuum back and forth over the entire floor until the carpet looks sparkling clean.[\[16\]](#_note-16)
    
    [![Clean Your Room Step 16 Version 5.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/37/Clean-Your-Room-Step-16-Version-5.jpg/aid40273-v4-728px-Clean-Your-Room-Step-16-Version-5.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Clean-Your-Room-Step-16-Version-5.jpg)
    
    *   If the vacuum isn’t sucking well, check if the vacuum bag or canister is full and change it if necessary.
    *   Vacuum your floor at least once a week. If you wear shoes inside, consider vacuuming more often.
4.  Sweep and mop the floors if applicable. Use the broom to push all the dirt and dust into 1 pile and then use a dustpan and brush to scoop it up. After this, dip your [mop](https://www.wikihow.com/Mop-a-Floor "Mop a Floor") into a bucket of soapy water and wipe it over the floors to remove any marks and dust. Rinse the mop every few minutes to ensure that it doesn’t spread dirt around the floors.[\[17\]](#_note-17)
    
    [![Clean Your Room Step 17 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4c/Clean-Your-Room-Step-17-Version-3.jpg/aid40273-v4-728px-Clean-Your-Room-Step-17-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Clean-Your-Room-Step-17-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   This will leave your floors feeling and looking nice and clean.
    *   Sweep and mop your floors at least once a week.
5.  Use glass cleaner to wipe the mirrors and windows. Liberally spray the glass cleaner over all your mirrors and windows and then use a cloth to wipe them clean. Continue to rub until there are no marks or streaks left on the glass. This will leave your windows and mirrors looking sparkly clean.[\[18\]](#_note-18)
    
    [![Clean Your Room Step 18 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6f/Clean-Your-Room-Step-18-Version-3.jpg/aid40273-v4-728px-Clean-Your-Room-Step-18-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Clean-Your-Room-Step-18-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   Clean your windows and mirrors each time that they get marked to make the job as quick and easy as possible.
    *   Microfiber cloths work well for cleaning glass.
    *   Don’t forget to clean the window tracks as well. Vacuum up loose debris in the tracks with a crevice attachment or a handheld vacuum cleaner. You can use an old toothbrush and some all-purpose cleaning solution to scrub away caked-on dirt and dust.
6.  Wipe the light switches and door handles with a disinfectant spray. These points are some of the most touched spots in your room. This means that over time they collect a lot of bacteria. Spray the switches and handles with a household disinfectant spray and then use a cloth or paper towel to wipe it off.[\[19\]](#_note-19)
    
    [![Clean Your Room Step 19 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/08/Clean-Your-Room-Step-19-Version-3.jpg/aid40273-v4-728px-Clean-Your-Room-Step-19-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Clean-Your-Room-Step-19-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   Disinfect your handles and switches once a week to keep them fresh and clean.
    *   Wipe off any outlet covers, too. Since they’re not as frequently touched, they don’t build up grime as fast as light switches, but keeping them clean and bright can help the overall look of the room.
