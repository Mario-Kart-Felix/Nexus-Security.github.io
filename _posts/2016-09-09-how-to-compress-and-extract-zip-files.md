With iOS 13 and iPadOS 13, you can natively extract ZIP files on your device and that is simply amazing. And that is not all, you can also create ZIP files right from the Files app. So, in this article, we bring you a straightforward guide on how to compress and extract ZIP files on iPhone and iPad. We have also mentioned another method that lets you deal with other archive formats as well as use it on iOS 12. With that said, let’s go ahead and learn about the steps.

-----------------------------------------------------

  

As mentioned above, you can manage archive files natively through the Files app on iOS 13 and iPadOS 13. However, it only supports two archive file formats (ZIP and RAR) and there are a few limitations for compressing files. So, if you want to uncompress other file formats such as TAR or 7z and without any restriction then you can use use the Shortcuts app method which we have discussed below. Further, if you are on iOS 12, you can also use the Shortcuts app to zip and unzip files seamlessly.
