iPhone and [Chromebook](https://beebom.com/what-is-a-chromebook/) are products from two tech giants who are distinct in their approach and often at crossroads on software compatibility. And since American students are increasingly using Chromebooks as their laptop and iPhones as their smartphone, the compatibility issue is getting even more vital. We did try [installing iTunes on Chromebook](https://beebom.com/how-install-itunes-on-chromebook/), but it didn’t work as intended. So, in this article, we take a look at ways we can connect iPhone to Chromebook to transfer photos and files. We have mentioned both USB and wireless methods to sync iPhone and Chromebook. So on that note, let’s go ahead and learn about the steps in detail.  

Connect iPhone to Chromebook and Transfer Photos via USB
--------------------------------------------------------

  

1\. Similar to Mac or Windows PC, **connect your iPhone to Chromebook with a USB lightning cable**. Instantly, you will get a pop-up on your iPhone to allow media access. Tap on “Allow” and you are almost done.

2\. Now open the native File Manager on your Chromebook and **you will find “Apple iPhone” in the left pane**. Open it further and there you have it. All your photos and videos from the iPhone will be available on Chromebook. Now, you can easily transfer the iPhone media and [edit photos on Chromebook](https://beebom.com/best-photo-editors-for-chromebook/) easily.

Connect iPhone to Chromebook and Transfer Files Wirelessly
----------------------------------------------------------

  

1\. Since AirDrop is not available on Chromebook, you can use an [alternative like AirDroid](https://beebom.com/airdrop-alternatives-windows-share-files-easily/) to transfer photos, videos and just about anything from your iPhone to Chromebook wirelessly. So, **install the AirDroid app** ([Free](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/airdroid-file-transfer-share/id1194539178)) on your iPhone first and create an AirDroid account.  

2\. Next, move to the “My Device” section and **tap on “AirDroid Web”**. Now, tap on “Scan QR code” and scan the QR code that I have mentioned in the next step.

3\. Click on this [link to open AirDroid Web](https://web.airdroid.com/) on your Chromebook. After that, **scan the QR code on the homepage** and it will connect to your iPhone. Now, log in to your AirDroid account on Chromebook as well.

  
  

  

_**Note:** Both your iPhone and Chromebook should be connected to a common WiFi network._

4\. Finally, you will find all your photos, videos, and files from the iPhone on your Chromebook. **All this is being done locally** so no data is sent to cloud servers.  

_**Note:** Bear in mind, the connection is using the HTTP protocol which means the data transfer is not encrypted and it’s not that secure. If you are using a public or a common WiFi network for work, I would recommend you to use a USB cable instead._
