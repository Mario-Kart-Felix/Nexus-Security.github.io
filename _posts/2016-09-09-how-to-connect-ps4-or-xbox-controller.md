[iOS 13](https://www.howtogeek.com/440039/the-best-new-features-in-ios-13/) and [iPadOS 13](https://www.howtogeek.com/423446/ipados-will-almost-make-your-ipad-a-real-computer/) open up the world of iPhone and iPad gaming to the two most popular game controllers. You can now connect a PS4 or Xbox One S controller directly to your device and instantly start playing any game that supports controllers.

Supported Models
----------------

iPhone and iPad previously supported game controllers, but they had to be certified using the [MFi (Made for iPhone) program](https://www.howtogeek.com/426208/what-does-apple-mfi-certified-mean/). The options were severely limited, expensive, and not that great.

iOS 13 and iPadOS 13 are adding support for more wireless controllers, but the system is not open for all Bluetooth-based wireless controllers. Only PS4 Dualshock 4 and Xbox One controllers are currently supported. The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller doesn’t work.

There are a couple of Xbox One controllers in the wild. Apple currently supports only model 1708, which is the Xbox One S controller (the original Xbox One controller doesn’t work). Most PS4 Dualshock controllers are supported (except for the CUH-ZCT1U model that shipped with the original PS4 back in 2013).

The easiest way to check if your controller is supported is by, well, connecting it to your iPhone or iPad.

How to Connect PS4 and Xbox Controller to iPhone and iPad
---------------------------------------------------------

You can pair a controller to your iPhone or iPad using the Bluetooth section in the Settings app. Open the “Settings” app on your iPhone or iPad and then tap on the “Bluetooth” option.

Here, make sure the Bluetooth feature is enabled and in discovery mode.

Now, let’s put your controller in pairing mode. If you’re using a PS4 Dualshock 4 controller, press and hold the “PS” and “Share” button together until the light at the back of the controller turns white and starts blinking rapidly.
