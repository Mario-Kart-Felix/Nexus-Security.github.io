If you’re moving between rooms in your office or home, you might need to switch between Wi-Fi networks or Bluetooth devices manually. Here’s how you can speed up the process of selecting the network using the [Control Center](https://www.howtogeek.com/325973/how-to-customize-your-iphone-or-ipads-control-center/) on the iPhone and iPad.

This is a new feature introduced in [iOS 13](https://www.howtogeek.com/440039/the-best-new-features-in-ios-13/) and [iPadOS 13](https://www.howtogeek.com/423446/ipados-will-almost-make-your-ipad-a-real-computer/). Like many other small features in this update, it solves a small annoyance in the everyday lives of iPhone and iPad users. With it, you no longer need to go to the Settings app to select Wi-Fi networks or Bluetooth devices.

To access this new feature, we’ll need to open the Control Center. If you’re using an iPhone X-style device with a notch at the top or an iPad, swipe down from the top-right edge of the screen. If you’re using an iPhone with a Home button, swipe up from the bottom of the screen to reveal the Control Center.

Now, press and hold on the “Toggles” section (the one in the top-left).

This will expand the panel. Here, you’ll see the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth button. You can tap on the toggles to quickly turn Wi-Fi or Bluetooth off.
