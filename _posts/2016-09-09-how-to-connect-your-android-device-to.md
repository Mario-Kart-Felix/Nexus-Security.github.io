Android devices are great, but their small size can sometimes be limiting. When you connect your device to a projector, you can share your screen with others for business or pleasure. Here are a few ways to do it.

If you don’t have a projector, you can also [connect Android to a TV](https://www.howtogeek.com/201822/how-to-connect-your-android-phone-to-your-tv/). Projectors are the better option, though, as they normally project a much bigger screen size than a TV, making them ideal for media playback or data presentations.

Connect Wirelessly via Chromecast
---------------------------------

The easiest method to connect an Android device to a projector is to use Google Chromecast. To do this, your projector must support HDMI connections.

Once you plug your Chromecast into the HDMI port, you can then wirelessly stream your Android device screen to it. Your Chromecast will then display the contents through the projector.

Make sure you’ve disabled any power-save mode on your Android device, as this can reduce the quality of the stream.

If you don’t already have the Google Home app, [download and install it from the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.chromecast.app).

Open the “Home” app, and then tap the Accounts tab in the bottom-right corner.
