With [Windows 10](https://beebom.com/windows-10-updates/) version 1903 (May 2019 Update), Microsoft is forcing users to opt for an online-only account during the setup process. Many users have reported that the option for a local account is no longer available. After the forced [Windows update fiasco](https://beebom.com/stop-windows-10-updates/), this is Microsoft’s latest push to bring more Windows users online. Microsoft suggests that having an online account brings additional features like OneDrive storage, password sharing, files and setting syncing, and more. However, there have been several [controversies](https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-privacy-microsoft-faces-new-probe-over-how-it-uses-your-data/) around its background [telemetry](https://beebom.com/how-improve-privacy-windows-10/) services so I would always prefer a local account. Thankfully, there is a way out and I am going to show you how to create a local account on Windows 10 during setup. The steps are quite easy so no worries on that front. Now let’s jump right in without any delay.  

Create a Local Account on Windows 10 During Setup
-------------------------------------------------

  

The key is to not provide internet access to the PC so that it will be forced to offer an option for a local account. Here is how you can circumvent Microsoft’s online setup process.  

1\. **If you are using an Ethernet connection**, make sure to unplug it from your computer before setting up Windows 10.  

2\. **If you are using [WiFi](https://beebom.com/how-create-wifi-hotspot-windows-10-without-third-party-apps/)** and have already connected your PC to an access point then either turn off your router for a while or restart your PC and click on “Skip” in the Network window.  

3\. Now comes the crucial part. After you have disabled internet access, **click on “Create Account”.**

Switch to a Local Account on Windows 10 After Setup
---------------------------------------------------

  

In case, **you have already signed in with a Microsoft account,** you can easily switch back to a local account. This will ensure your data remains on your computer locally and is not used for user tracking or ad targeting. Here is how to go about it.  

1\. Press the Windows key once and **type “account”**. After that, click on the first result: “Manage your account”.

2\. Here, **click on “Sign in with a local account instead”**. It will seek your confirmation again, just press on “Yes” and the online Microsoft account will be removed. After that, it will prompt you to set a password for your local account.
