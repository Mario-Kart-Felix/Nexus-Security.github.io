Being extremely fond of customization, I’m always on the lookout to find some cool ways to add personal touches to my Mac. Personalization sort of keeps mundane feeling at bay, doesn’t it? And for those who have a liking for personalization, macOS offers a nice way to customize file and folder icons on Mac. Aside from giving a unique look to the files, it also makes it a tad easier to recognize a specific item. If this sounds interesting to you, let me show you how you can create custom icons for your favorite folders on macOS.  

Create Custom Icons for Files and Folders on Your Mac
-----------------------------------------------------

  

Probably the best part about this hack is that you can make a custom icon for any file using your own photos and even the icons downloaded from the web. As it works even on older macOS versions like [macOS Mojave](https://beebom.com/best-new-macos-mojave-features/), compatibility shouldn’t be a barrier either. What’s more, you also get the option to choose the icon from another file. With that said, let’s get started!  

1\. To get started, **double-click on a photo or icon** to open it in the Preview app.

_**Note:** It’s worth noting that if any icon (downloaded from online) is in the .icns format, you will be able to directly drag it on the icon in a file’s Info panel. _  

2\. Now, click on the **Edit** menu and choose **Select All.** Alternately, you can also use the **Command-A** [keyboard shortcut.](https://beebom.com/cool-mac-keyboard-shortcuts/)  

![Choose Select All in Edit menu](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Choose-Select-All-in-Edit-menu.jpg)

3\. Next, select **Edit > Copy** in the Preview’s menu. Alternately, use the **Command-C** keyboard shortcut.

4\. Next up, **right-click on the file or folder** which icon you wish to change and choose the **Get Info** option in the menu.

7\. Finally, **close the Info panel**. Voila! The change would come into effect instantly. Take a look at the screenshot below.
