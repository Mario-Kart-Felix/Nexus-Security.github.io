The new Share Sheet in iOS 13 and [iPadOS 13](https://www.howtogeek.com/423446/ipados-will-almost-make-your-ipad-a-real-computer/) is smarter and expansive. Keep scrolling up to reveal all available actions and shortcuts. At first glance, this can seem a bit complex. Here’s how you can simplify it by customizing and adding your favorite actions.

How to Use the New Share Sheet
------------------------------

Let’s start with the part of Share Sheet which will be the most familiar—the Apps panel. You can still swipe horizontally to find apps you can share the data with.

For instance, if you’re used to sharing photos or links to WhatsApp, you don’t need to adopt a new method. We’ll talk about customizing this section below.

On top of the new Share Sheet, you’ll find a quick-share panel. This section lists nearby AirDrop devices and your recent iMessage conversations. Using this new panel, you can quickly share the selected data in a Messages thread without searching for the contact (like you had to in iOS 12).

Below the Apps panel, you’ll now find a newly designed, vertically scrolling list. This list is broken down into a couple of parts, depending on which app you’re using.

First, you’ll see Favorites. By default, this will highlight one or two most frequent actions for an app. So for an app [like Safari](https://www.howtogeek.com/408322/how-to-open-links-in-the-background-on-safari-on-iphone-and-ipad/), it would be Copy. For Photos, it would be Copy Photo, and so on. This section is customizable, but we’ll come to that in the next section.

Below Favorites, you’ll see all actions available to the related app. This is also customizable.
