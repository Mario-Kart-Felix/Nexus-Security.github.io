When I’m engrossed in work on Mac, the thing that peeves me the most is the ping-pong of unnecessary website notifications. They kind of play spoilsport for attention. Luckily, I’m not alone to dislike those unsolicited alerts, am I? As is usually the case with most things, macOS offers the needed flexibility to handle Safari notifications and even keep useless ones at bay. So, if you think that it’s high time to control website alerts to have [some peace of mind](https://beebom.com/best-mind-mapping-apps-mac/) while browsing the web or reading articles, here is the quick rundown to customize website notifications in Safari on Mac.  

Manage Website Notifications in Safari on macOS
-----------------------------------------------

  

With customization, I mean taking control of most aspects: appearance, the order in which they show up in the Notification Center, and even putting a no-entry on the redundant alerts. Aside from keeping the noise away and helping you concentrate on your task, it can also play a decent role in [improving the battery of your MacBook](https://beebom.com/how-disable-turbo-boost-prevent-mac-heating/). As you may have already guessed, it’s like killing two birds with one stone. Now that the talk is over, let’s get started with steps!  

### Customize How Safari Notifications Appear

  

Depending on your preference, you can fine-tune how Safari notifications appear on your Mac. For instance, you can choose between banners and alerts style. While banners show up in the top right corner of the screen and go away automatically, alerts will remain on the screen until you dismiss them.  

You also have the option to hide notifications on the lock screen, make them appear always or allow them to show up only when the computer is unlocked. Besides, you can also sort alerts based on recents, recents by app, and manually by app.  

Click on the **Apple menu -> System Preferences -> Notifications.** Now, select **Safari** in the sidebar and then customize the notification alert style and other settings.

Just in case, you don’t want to see alerts from Safari completely, turn off the toggle for **Allow Notifications from Safari**.  

_**Note:** You can follow these same steps to ideally customize notifications for specific apps on your Mac. If you want to have more control, fine-tune the alerts of each app in line with your needs. _  

### Disallow Websites to Ask for Permission to Send Push Notifications

  

Do you find the website popups asking you to allow them to send you notifications annoying? If yes, you can choose to disallow them to prevent those popups from showing up repeatedly.

### Stop Receiving Push Notifications from a Website in Safari

  

Is there a website that keeps on sending you notifications way too frequently? Then, why not stop it right now. Safari lets you prevent individual sites from sending you alerts, which could be helpful if you want to impose restrictions selectively to keep the unwanted notifications away.  

Launch **Safari** app on your Mac -> **Safari menu -> Preferences -> Websites -> Notifications**. Find the **specific website** from which you don’t want to receive alerts anymore. Then, click on the **drop-down menu** next to the site and choose **Deny.**

Siri keeps a close watch on your browsing history and offers helpful suggestions to enhance your user experience. if you no longer want to see those suggestions or find them useless, you can stop the virtual assistant from doing so. To do it, click on the **Apple menu -> System Preferences -> Siri ->** **Siri Suggestions & Privacy.**
