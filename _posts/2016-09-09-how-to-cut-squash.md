There are many kinds of squash, such as [butternut](https://www.wikihow.com/Cut-Butternut-Squash "Cut Butternut Squash") and [acorn](https://www.wikihow.com/Cut-Acorn-Squash "Cut Acorn Squash"), that have tough, starchy interiors that are hard to cut. If you're making a recipe with squash, you'll have to cut it into strips or cubes so it can cook quickly and evenly. Although squashes might be differently shaped, they can all be cut the same way. Just make sure to practice safe knife skills while you're making your cuts!

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Cut-Squash&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Peeling and Halving the Squash")\]Peeling and Halving the Squash

1.  Cut off the top and bottom of the squash. Lay the squash on its side on top of a cutting board. Use a large chef's knife that's about long so it can cut through the squash completely. Hold the squash steady with your nondominant hand and use the knife to slice the top and bottom areas so they're flat.[\[1\]](#_note-1)  
      
    *   Make sure to remove the stem completely since you won't be able to cut through it.
2.  [Peel the squash](https://www.wikihow.com/Peel-Squash "Peel Squash") if you want to remove the skin. Keep the squash in place with your nondominant hand and hold a vegetable peeler in your dominant hand so it's at a 45-degree angle to the squash. Press the peeler into the squash, then pull it down along the length of the squash to remove the skin. Rotate the squash when you're finished peeling one side so you can peel the rest of the skin.[\[2\]](#_note-2)  
      
    *   You don't have to peel the squash if you don't want to.
    *   Try microwaving the squash for 30 seconds to heat up the skin and make it easier to peel.
3.  Set the squash upright so the widest side is on the bottom. Put the squash on your cutting board so one of the flat edges you cut is on the bottom. Make sure the widest part of the squash is closer to the cutting board so it doesn't tip over or move as much while you're cutting it.[\[3\]](#_note-3)  
      
    
    [![Cut Squash Step 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/76/Cut-Squash-Step-3.jpg/aid11033677-v4-728px-Cut-Squash-Step-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Cut-Squash-Step-3.jpg)
    
    *   Put your cutting board on a level surface so it doesn't wobble while you're using it.
4.  Use a rocking motion to cut through the middle of the squash. Use the same chef's knife as before and set the blade in the middle of the top flat side. Press the blade into the squash and put your hand on top so the squash can't move around. Rock your knife up and down to work through the squash until you cut through the bottom.[\[4\]](#_note-4)  
      
    *   If you have trouble cutting through the squash right away, try putting it in the microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute to make it easier. Be careful since the inside of the squash will be hot.
    *   Don't keep your fingers below the knife blade since the blade could slip and you could cut yourself.
5.  Scoop out the seeds with a metal spoon. Look for the area inside your squash that contains the seeds and scrape them out. Use the edge of a metal spoon to remove all of the seeds so they don't get in the way while you're cutting the squash. Be sure to remove any of the stringy pieces of the squash that are hanging near the seeds as well.[\[5\]](#_note-5)  
      
    *   You can throw away or [roast the seeds](https://www.wikihow.com/Roast-Squash-Seeds "Roast Squash Seeds") when you're finished.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Cut-Squash&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Cutting the Squash into Strips or Cubes")\]Cutting the Squash into Strips or Cubes

1.  Cut the squash into strips that are thick. Turn the halves of squash over so the flat sides are against the cutting board and the longest side faces you. Start on one end of the squash and use your knife to cut strips. Start with the tip of your knife on the board and rock it forward to cut through the squash.[\[6\]](#_note-6)  
      
    *   Keep your fingers curled on your nondominant hand so you don't cut yourself.
    *   The size of the strips depends on the recipe you're following. Check it before you start cutting your squash to make sure it's the right size.
2.  Stack the slices and cut them in half lengthwise. Take 3-4 strips you just cut and stack them on top of one another so they line up along an edge. Squeeze the long sides of your stack to hold them in place while you cut them in half lengthwise. When you're finished with your cut, you should have 6-8 pieces that are all uniform in size.[\[7\]](#_note-7)  
      
    *   You can cook the squash in strips if you want to.
3.  Rotate the strips and cut them into cubes if you want. Turn the strips 90-degrees so the longer edges are facing toward you. Use your knife to cut then strips into cubes so they are all the same size. Keep cutting your squash until it's all cubed.[\[8\]](#_note-8)  
      
    *   A squash that's will give you about 4 ½ cups (0.92 kg) of cubed squash
4.  Store squash in your fridge for up to 4 days. If you don't plan on cooking the squash right away, then put the cubes or strips into an airtight container or plastic bag. Press all the air out if you can and then put it in your fridge. You can use the squash for up to 4 days before it starts to go bad.[\[9\]](#_note-9)

    *   You can freeze squash as well, but it stays preserved better if you cook it first.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Cut-Squash&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Staying Safe While Cutting")\]Staying Safe While Cutting

1.  [Sharpen your knives](https://www.wikihow.com/Sharpen-a-Knife "Sharpen a Knife") before you start cutting. Squash is tough when it's raw and can be difficult to cut through with a dull knife. Drag the blade of your knife at a 20-degree angle across a whetstone or a honing rod to keep the blade sharp. Make sure to sharpen each side of the knife so it cuts evenly.[\[10\]](#_note-10)  
      
    
    [![Cut Squash Step 10.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0d/Cut-Squash-Step-10.jpg/aid11033677-v4-728px-Cut-Squash-Step-10.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Cut-Squash-Step-10.jpg)
    
    *   Sharpen your knives every 2-4 times you use them to maintain their edge.
2.  Make sure your cutting surface is stable. Use a flat surface, like a counter or table top, when you cut your squash, or else it could fall. Set your cutting board down and press down on each side to make sure it doesn't wobble. If it does, find a new spot to cut the squash.[\[11\]](#_note-11)  
      
    
    [![Cut Squash Step 11.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/64/Cut-Squash-Step-11.jpg/aid11033677-v4-728px-Cut-Squash-Step-11.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Cut-Squash-Step-11.jpg)
    
    *   If a plastic cutting board wobbles, check the bottoms to see if any of the rubber grips have fallen off on the bottom. If they have, then set something underneath the cutting board to prevent it from moving.
3.  Hit the knife lightly with a rubber mallet if it gets stuck. Sometimes, your knife may get stuck while you're cutting a large squash. Hold the handle of the knife from the bottom and tap the top of the handle with a rubber mallet. Keep tapping the knife until it gets through the tough spot, and then cut the rest of the squash as usual.[\[12\]](#_note-12)  
      
    *   Don't hit the squash too hard or the knife may make a crooked cut.
