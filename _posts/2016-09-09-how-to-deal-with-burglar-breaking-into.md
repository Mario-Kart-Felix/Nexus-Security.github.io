Your home is your castle, so you want to feel safe and secure inside of it. Unfortunately, your home might be entered by a burglar who’s after your money or valuables. Typically, burglars want to take things without harming a home’s occupants, but that doesn’t make them any less scary! If you hear a burglar in your home, hide from them if you can. Otherwise, tell them you called the police and use your household objects to fight them off. In the meantime, secure your home to make it less vulnerable to would-be burglars.

1.  Escape from your home if that’s possible. Generally, it’s better to leave your home if an intruder is inside. Go to the closest door or window and flee to safety. Once you’re secure, call the police for help.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   If neighbors live nearby, run to their house for safety. Otherwise, look for somewhere you can hide, such as inside a grove of trees or behind a fence.
2.  Hide inside the closest room or closet with a locking door. Look around you and pick out the most secure hiding spot. If you can, move to a room or closet that has a locking door. Get inside and secure the lock.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

    *   You might also look for a hiding spot inside the room. For instance, you might get under the bed or inside a cabinet to further conceal yourself.
3.  Barricade the door to keep the burglar out. Push heavy pieces of furniture in front of the door to keep it closed if you can. Alternatively, lean a chair under the door knob so it’s hard to push open the door. If the door opens outward, loop a belt around the door handle and the leg on a heavy piece of furniture.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

    *   For instance, you might push your dresser in front of your bedroom door. Then, sit in front of the dresser.
4.  Be as quiet as possible so you aren’t found. Once you’re hidden, try not to make any noise. Don’t talk accept to tell emergency services that you have a burglar. Additionally, don’t shift around or play with something.[\[4\]](#_note-4)

    *   Make sure your phone is on silent or vibrate.
    *   Don’t try to move hiding spots. This will make noise and might draw attention to you.
5.  Listen carefully so you won’t be surprised by the attacker. While it’s scary to think about, it’s likely that the burglar is going to go through your home looking for valuables. They might reach the room where you’re hiding before the police arrive. Listen so that you can hear what they’re doing. Pay attention to the following:[\[5\]](#_note-5)

    *   Do you hear footsteps or other noises coming your way? If so, prepare to run or fight.
    *   Does it sound like the burglar is talking to someone else? If so, there could be more than 1 burglar.
    *   Can you hear your property being picked up and packed? This can give you an idea of where the burglar might be located.
6.  [Call the police](https://www.wikihow.com/Call-Emergency-Services "Call Emergency Services") once you’re in a secure hiding place. After you find a hiding spot, use your cell phone to call for help. Tell the dispatcher your name, your address, and that you have a burglar. Then, explain that you’re hiding and need to be quiet. Stay on the line until they say it’s safe to hang up.[\[6\]](#_note-6)

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Confronting the Intruder")\]Confronting the Intruder

1.  Confront the intruder only if hiding isn’t an option. Generally, it’s safer to avoid contact with an intruder rather than confronting them. You don’t know their motives for entering your home, and they may panic and hurt you if they find out you’re there. Do your best to escape or stay hidden.[\[7\]](#_note-7)
    
    [![Deal With a Burglar Breaking Into Your Home Step 7 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a2/Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/aid1549383-v4-728px-Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-7-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-7-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   Your personal safety is most important. Don’t risk your life to save your stuff!
    *   Keep in mind that the intruder may be more likely to get caught if you hide and call the police. If they think you’re not home, they might still be in your home when the police arrive.
2.  Shout “I’ve just called the police” to possibly scare them away. If you’re discovered or can’t find a hiding spot, yell that you’ve called the police already. Shout it out several times so you know that they’ve heard you. This might scare the burglar and get them to leave voluntarily.[\[8\]](#_note-8)

    *   You might shout, “I’ve called the police! The police are on their way! I called 911! The police will be here any minute!”
3.  Get your firearm for protection if you have one. You might choose to protect your home with a gun. If so, retrieve your gun from it’s secure spot as soon as you hear the burglar. Then, prepare to use your gun for protection.[\[9\]](#_note-9)
    
    [![Deal With a Burglar Breaking Into Your Home Step 9 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/15/Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-9-Version-3.jpg/aid1549383-v4-728px-Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-9-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-9-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   You may choose to shout to the burglar that you have a gun. You could yell, "I have a gun!" However, it’s possible that the burglar could also have one.
    *   It’s legal in some areas for you to shoot a burglar. However, there may be restrictions on what’s legal, so research the laws in your area. For instance, you might not be able to fire on an intruder who is leaving.
4.  Pick up a knife if you’re near your kitchen. Don’t try to go to the kitchen to retrieve a knife. However, grab a knife if you’re close to the kitchen when you hear the burglar. Keep the knife in your hand so that you can surprise the attacker with it if they get close to you.[\[10\]](#_note-10)

    *   While a knife is a great weapon, it might be hard to use and could get taken from you. Don’t approach the burglar with the knife. Use it to scare them off.
5.  Grab a heavy object that you can use as a weapon. You don’t need a conventional weapon to fight someone off. Use a household item as a makeshift weapon to give you an advantage against the burglar. Strike the burglar with your weapon if they get close to you. Here are some great options for weapons:[\[11\]](#_note-11)

    *   A pot or pan
    *   A wine bottle
    *   A lamp
    *   A statue or bust
    *   A belt
    *   Perfume
    *   Hairspray
    *   Bug spray
6.  Strike the burglar’s weak points to help incapacitate them. If you’re close to the intruder, hit them where it hurts. Aim your weapon or a kick at their groin first if they’re a man. Then, attack their eyes, nose, neck, knees, and stomach. Hit them as hard as you can, then run away.[\[12\]](#_note-12)

    *   Your goal isn’t to fight, injure, or detain the burglar. Just try to incapacitate them long enough for you to run away.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Securing Your Home")\]Securing Your Home

1.  Practice your plan for a home invasion in advance. Try not to worry too much about potential burglars because you’re probably safe. However, it’s helpful to practice how you’ll handle a burglary so you’re prepared. Make a plan with your family and practice it so you feel ready to carry it out. Here are some things to consider:[\[13\]](#_note-13)
    
    [![Deal With a Burglar Breaking Into Your Home Step 13 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/fb/Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-13-Version-3.jpg/aid1549383-v4-728px-Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-13-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-13-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   Plan an escape route from your bedroom and the common areas.
    *   Create a danger word that warns other household members of an intruder.
    *   Designate an area for all household members to meet up.
    *   Create a safe room by installing a heavy, locking door on one room.
2.  Keep your doors and windows locked at all times. Don’t give a burglar easy access to your home. Close and secure all exterior doors and windows, even if you’re home. This prevents crimes of opportunity.[\[14\]](#_note-14)
    
    [![Deal With a Burglar Breaking Into Your Home Step 4 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/52/Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid1549383-v4-728px-Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-4-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-4-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   Check your doors and windows before you go to bed every night to make sure they’re locked.
    *   Add deadbolts to your exterior doors.
3.  Store expensive items in your garage out-of-sight. Burglars are hoping for an easy score, so they’ll be tempted to grab things like bicycles or expensive tools. Keep these items in your garage when they’re not in use, and make sure you or your children don’t leave them laying in your yard.[\[15\]](#_note-15)
    
    [![Deal With a Burglar Breaking Into Your Home Step 15.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9c/Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-15.jpg/aid1549383-v4-728px-Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-15.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-15.jpg)
    
    *   Burglars might see these items laying in your yard while they’re casing homes and come back later to steal them.
4.  Trim the vegetation around your home so a burglar can’t sneak around. You might think that shrubs and bushes hide your home, but they actually hide would-be intruders. Burglars can easily creep around your home if they’re shrouded in leafy vegetation. Eliminate these hiding spots by keeping your bushes, shrubs, and grass trimmed.[\[16\]](#_note-16)
    
    [![Deal With a Burglar Breaking Into Your Home Step 16.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c4/Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-16.jpg/aid1549383-v4-728px-Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-16.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-16.jpg)
    
    *   If you have a multi-story home, trim any tree branches that would allow a burglar easy access to a window or balcony.
5.  Install outdoor lighting so would-be burglars feel exposed. Burglars want to stay hidden in the dark, so they might avoid your home if it’s well-lit. Put lights above your exterior doors and keep them on while it’s dark outside. Additionally, install motion-activated flood lights over your garage and the side of your home.[\[17\]](#_note-17)
    
    [![Deal With a Burglar Breaking Into Your Home Step 3 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/87/Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid1549383-v4-728px-Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-3-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-3-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   Check around your home for areas that might need more lighting to be secure.
6.  Use curtains to prevent potential burglars from spotting your goods. While casing your home, would-be burglars will look through your windows to see if you have valuables. Make it harder for them to see inside by installing curtains or blinds over your windows. This makes it less tempting for a burglar to enter your home.[\[18\]](#_note-18)
    
    [![Deal With a Burglar Breaking Into Your Home Step 18.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9b/Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-18.jpg/aid1549383-v4-728px-Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-18.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-18.jpg)
    
    *   It’s especially important to cover your windows at night. If you have a light on, the contents of your rooms will be very visible from outside.
7.  Install a security camera over your front door or garage as a deterrence. Burglars don’t want to get caught, so they might avoid your home if they see a visible camera. Plus, you’ll have evidence to give the police if they do break into your home. Put your camera above your door or above your garage to scare off potential burglars.[\[19\]](#_note-19)
    
    [![Deal With a Burglar Breaking Into Your Home Step 19.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/91/Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-19.jpg/aid1549383-v4-728px-Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-19.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-19.jpg)
    
    *   A camera will be a better deterrent if it’s easily visible to intruders.
8.  Get a home alarm to scare off burglars and call for help. Investing in a home alarm system may scare off any burglars who do try to enter your home. Plus, it’ll call the police on your behalf so help arrives faster. Research home alarm companies to find one that fits your needs and preferences. Then, get an alarm installed.[\[20\]](#_note-20)
    
    [![Deal With a Burglar Breaking Into Your Home Step 20.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/af/Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-20.jpg/aid1549383-v4-728px-Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-20.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home-Step-20.jpg)
    
    *   Be sure to display you home alarm company’s sign outside your home so potential burglars know you’re protected.

\[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Deal-With-a-Burglar-Breaking-Into-Your-Home&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Tips")\]Tips
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Burglars usually target empty homes, so they may run away if they know you’re there. However, don’t count on that! It’s best to stay hidden if you can.
*   If you manage to see the burglar, try to memorize as many details about them as you can. If they get away, you can provide them to the police as they attempt to catch them.
*   If you want a pet, consider getting a big dog to deter potential burglars.
*   If you’re particularly worried about a break-in, consider learning self-defense. It will make you more prepared to fight off an attacker and more confident in a crisis.
*   If you use your cellphone to call emergency services, keep it on vibrate. Otherwise, there will be a loud ringtone if they need to call you back, which will alert the burglar to your location.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Learn your jurisdiction’s laws on self-defense. While some allow the use of lethal force when an individual breaks into your home, others have varying definitions of “reasonable force”.
*   Call the police if you have been robbed so they can open an investigation.
