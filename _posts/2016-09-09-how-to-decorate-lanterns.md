### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Decorate-Lanterns&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Decorating a Lantern for Different Seasons")\]Decorating a Lantern for Different Seasons

1.  Tie an ornament to the handle of your lantern in winter. Purchase a relatively flat holiday ornament, such as a sparkly snowflake, from a local craft store or a local holiday store. Since there should already be a string attached to the top, it should be easy to tie the string to the center of the handle on your lantern to give it some wintry flair.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

2.  Wrap a pine garland around the base of your lantern in winter. Purchase a fake pine garland from your local craft store or holiday store. Wrap the garland around the outside of the base of your lantern. To add a holiday feel to the garland, string some cranberries onto a strand of dental floss and weave it throughout the garland.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

    *   You may need to wrap the garland around more than once, depending on how long it is.
3.  Surround the base of a candle with fake fall plants. Get orange and purple fake plants, such as fall leaves, gourds, and berries, from a craft store. Place a container underneath a candle inside of your lantern to act as a base and elevate the candle. Then, spread the fake plants all around the container to hide it.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

    *   When the candle is lit, keep a close eye on it to prevent any fire-related incidents from occurring.
4.  Attach a makeshift bouquet of fake fall plants to the lantern’s handle. Gather the stems of several different fake fall plants, such as grass bush and berries. Hold them together by the stem and then wrap the stems together tightly with floral wire. Then, use some more floral wire to attach the bouquet to the handle of the lantern so that the bouquet hangs upside down and over the corner of the lantern.[\[4\]](#_note-4)  
      
    
5.  Wrap a green summer garland around a battery-powered candle. Place a battery-powered cylindrical candle inside of your lantern. Purchase a green leafy garland from a craft store and wrap it tightly around the candle inside of the lantern several times to give your lantern a summery feel.[\[5\]](#_note-5)  
      
    
6.  Glue a sheer bow and silk daisies to a corner of the lantern in the summer. Cut a long piece of wired sheer ribbon and tie it in a bow. Then, glue three silk gerbera daisies to the center of the bow with a hot glue gun. Attach the back of the bow to the corner of the lantern with hot glue as well.[\[6\]](#_note-6)  
      
    
7.  Make a resin bird the focal point of your spring lantern. Line the bottom of your lantern with fake or [real moss](https://www.wikihow.com/Dry-Moss "Dry Moss"). Place a fake bird’s nest in the front center of the lantern’s interior. Place a resin bird in the nest and fill in extra space around the nest with pastel-colored silk flowers.[\[7\]](#_note-7)

    *   You can get fake moss, silk flowers, resin birds, and fake bird’s nests from most craft stores.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Decorate-Lanterns&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Decorating a Paper Lantern")\]Decorating a Paper Lantern

1.  Glue fake flower petals to the outside of the lantern. Purchase some white silk flowers from a craft store and carefully pull the petals apart. Attach a single layer of petals to the lantern with a hot glue gun until the entire surface is covered. Then, use the hot glue gun to glue a single sequin to the center of every petal.[\[8\]](#_note-8)  
      
    
2.  Color-block your paper lantern with markers. There should be multiple vertical seams along the inside of your paper lanterns. Decide which 2 colors you’d like your lantern to be. Then, use a marker to trace each seam with one of the colors. Use this marker to color in every other section. Then, use your second marker to color in the remaining alternating sections.[\[9\]](#_note-9)  
      
    
    [![Decorate Lanterns Step 9.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/fb/Decorate-Lanterns-Step-9.jpg/aid9637011-v4-728px-Decorate-Lanterns-Step-9.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Decorate-Lanterns-Step-9.jpg)
    
3.  Put fake flowers inside your paper lantern. Buy some matching silk flowers and ribbon that you like from a local craft store. Flip your lantern upside down and tie your ribbon into a bow around the base of the opening. Then, fill the lantern with your silk flowers and display the lantern on a flat surface.[\[10\]](#_note-10)
    
    [![Decorate Lanterns Step 10.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/da/Decorate-Lanterns-Step-10.jpg/aid9637011-v4-728px-Decorate-Lanterns-Step-10.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Decorate-Lanterns-Step-10.jpg)
    
4.  Dye your paper lantern. Pour 34 oz (1 liter) of cold water into a big bowl. Separately, stir together of a dye of your choice and 17 oz (½ liter) of tepid water. Pour the mixture into the bowl of cold water. Place your lantern into the bowl on top of the surface of the water and tip it slightly so that the water gets inside of the lantern. Rotate the lantern all the way around so that it gets completely coated in dye, and then hang the lantern up to dry.[\[11\]](#_note-11)  
      
    

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Decorate-Lanterns&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Decorating a Lantern for a Wedding")\]Decorating a Lantern for a Wedding

1.  Fill the base with [fresh flower petals](https://www.wikihow.com/Keep-Rose-Petals-Fresh "Keep Rose Petals Fresh"). Hold a wedding flower of your choosing, such as a rose, by the stem and gently pick all of its petals off. When you’re done, repeat this process on several different flowers. Then, sprinkle the petals all over the interior floor of your lantern to achieve soft, simple, prettiness. These can be used as additions to centerpieces or you can hang them on small poles along the ceremonial aisle.[\[12\]](#_note-12)  
      
    *   This may be a great option if you have some flower pieces leftover after you’ve made the bouquets, [boutonnieres](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Boutonniere "Make a Boutonniere"), and all other wedding decorations that your flowers were intended for.
2.  Surround the base of the lantern with flowers and/or candles. If you’re using lanterns in your centerpieces, embellish them on the outside with 2-3 small candles that match the rest of your decor. Then, put a few flowers into 2 or 3 identical small vases around the outside of your lanterns or wrap them around garland-style. This should help to tie the lanterns into the rest of the decorations effectively.[\[13\]](#_note-13)
    
    [![Decorate Lanterns Step 13.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9f/Decorate-Lanterns-Step-13.jpg/aid9637011-v4-728px-Decorate-Lanterns-Step-13.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Decorate-Lanterns-Step-13.jpg)
    
3.  Tie a ribbon to the handle of the lantern. This is a quick, simple way to add some personal flair to your lantern. If you’re going for a vintage and/or feminine look, tie simple white lace ribbon around the handle. If your decor is centered more around a color than a style, tie a silk ribbon that’s one of your wedding colors into a bow around the handle instead.[\[14\]](#_note-14)  
      
    
4.  Place the lantern inside a wooden box. This works especially well for rustic-themed centerpieces. Center the lantern inside of a short, topless wooden decorative box and fill in the extra space in the box with flowers and/or greenery of your choice.[\[15\]](#_note-15)
