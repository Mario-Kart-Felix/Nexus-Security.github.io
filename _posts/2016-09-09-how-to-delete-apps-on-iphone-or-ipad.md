Apple changed the way your iPhone and iPad’s home screen works in [iOS 13](https://www.howtogeek.com/440039/the-best-new-features-in-ios-13/). Now, when you long-press an app’s icon, you’ll first see a contextual menu rather than the usual jiggling icons with “x” buttons.

This is all because Apple is getting rid of [3D Touch](https://www.howtogeek.com/366074/no-one-knew-3d-touch-existed-and-now-its-going-away/). Rather than pressing the screen extra hard to open that contextual menu, you just have to long-press an icon, and the menu will appear. There’s now an extra step before those app icons start shaking around.

Delete Apps From the Home Screen
--------------------------------

To use the new context menu, long-press an app icon until the menu appears and tap “Rearrange apps.” App icons will start jiggling, and you can move them around or delete them.

You can also long-press the app icon and continue long-pressing without lifting your finger, even after the contextual menu appears. If you wait another moment, the menu will vanish, and app icons will start jiggling.

Tap the “x” button for an app icon and tap “Delete” to confirm. Tap “Done” in the top right corner of your screen when you’re done.

Uninstall Apps From Settings
----------------------------

You can also uninstall apps from Settings. Head to Settings > General > iPhone Storage or iPad Storage. This screen shows you a list of your installed apps along with how much local storage they’re using. Tap an app in this list and tap “Delete App” to delete it.
