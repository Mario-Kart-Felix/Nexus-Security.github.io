Putting health and fitness at the forefront, Apple has vastly improved the stock health app. Features like exercise tracking, [cycle tracking](https://beebom.com/set-up-cycle-tracking-ios-13-watchos-6/), [hearing health](https://beebom.com/set-up-noise-app-measure-decibel-levels-apple-watch/), and sleep tracking have made it a great tool for fitness freaks and health-conscious people alike. The app keeps a record of all of your data including heart rate, walking/running steps, and more so that you can track your progress and even share your data. While many prefer to keep the health data forever, I like to wipe them out after a certain time – especially when those piles of data are no longer needed. It not only prevents the Health app from hogging plenty of storage but also helps it remain clutter-free. In this tutorial, I’m going to show you how you can delete entire Health data from iPhone on iOS 13 or later.   

Delete All Health Data from iPhone
----------------------------------

  

Depending on your needs, you can eliminate all the saved health records at one go or clear out individual data from specific categories like heart rate and active energy. What about the health data synced with other apps? Well, the Health app also lets you clean up the records synced with other apps like Clock, Messages and more. So, you get the desired control over your health data and can manage it based on your convenience. So, let’s jump right in to it and get started with the steps!  

### Deleting App Health Data from iPhone

  

1\. Open the **Health app** on your iPhone and tap on the **profile photo** at the top right corner.
