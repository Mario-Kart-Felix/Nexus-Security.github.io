If you frequently [back up your iPhone on Mac](https://beebom.com/how-back-up-ios-devices-mac-running-macos-catalina/) but forget to remove the old backups after the new ones are made, chances are a large chunk of storage might already be hogged by the redundant files on your macOS device. Considering the large size of each backup, I wouldn’t be surprised if your Mac is cluttered for space and often starts [overheating](https://beebom.com/how-disable-turbo-boost-prevent-mac-heating/) and becomes slow. Whether you want to prevent your computer from falling prey to useless files or stop unnecessary data from piling up over time, let me tell you that you can delete your iPhone or iPad backups on macOS Catalina, even without iTunes which is now officially dead. Here is the step-by-step rundown to get you started!  

Delete iPhone/iPad Backups on Mac Running macOS Catalina
--------------------------------------------------------

  

As Finder has always been a versatile app, it’s a good [alternative to iTunes](https://beebom.com/best-itunes-alternatives/) especially for [syncing iOS devices](https://beebom.com/sync-iphone-ipad-with-mac-macos-catalina/) and managing their backups. So, at any time you want to remove the previous files, you can head into the file manager, check out the pile-ups, and remove the unnecessary ones at your own will. In more ways than one, the process is quite similar to the one involving iTunes.  

1\. First off, **connect your iPhone or iPad** to your Mac using a cable.
