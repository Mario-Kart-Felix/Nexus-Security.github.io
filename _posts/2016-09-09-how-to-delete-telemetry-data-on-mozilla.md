Earlier this week, Mozilla [announced](https://beebom.com/firefox-lets-you-delete-collected-data/) that it will let Firefox users delete all the telemetry data collected to date in order to comply with the new California Consumer Privacy Act. The feature got rolled out with Firefox 72 version update and today, we will be taking a look at how we can delete them.  

What is Telemetry Data?
-----------------------

  

For the uninitiated, telemetry data refers to the interaction data and technical data collected by the browser. Interaction data includes information like the number of tabs and windows you open, the number of webpages you visit, browsing session length, and the type of Firefox add-ons you install.  

On the other hand, technical data refers to information about your browser’s version, language, the operating system you use, and your PC’s hardware specifications, and error logs.  

_Note: Before we get started, make sure you update your Firefox browser to the latest version. The method works for Firefox version 72 and above. If you’re not sure of your Firefox version, you may check it from Help -> About Firefox accessible through the hamburger menu present in the top right corner of your Firefox browser._  

Delete Telemetry Data on Firefox
--------------------------------

  

1\. Open Firefox and click on the hamburger menu (horizontal three lines) present in the top right corner of your browser and find “Options” from the list. Alternatively, you can enter “about:preferences” in your address bar to access Options.

3\. Scroll down until you find a section titled “Firefox Data Collection and Use”. Here, you will see a checkbox that reads “Allow Firefox to send technical and interaction data to Mozilla”. Uncheck it and Firefox will delete all the telemetry data associated with your browser in 30 days.
