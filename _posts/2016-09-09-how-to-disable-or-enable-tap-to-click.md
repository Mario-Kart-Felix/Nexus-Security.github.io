Windows laptops often let you tap one or more fingers on the touchpad or trackpad to click. If this gets in your way, you can disable it—or enable it if it’s not working.

Different Laptops Have the Option in Different Places
-----------------------------------------------------

Generally, you can tap with one finger to left-click and tap with two fingers to right-click. This option is relatively easy to enable and disable, although it’s in different places depending on the touchpad hardware your laptop manufacturer included and how they configured it. If you disable tap-to-click, you can still click by depressing the trackpad or pressing the buttons on it.

Many modern Windows laptops have [Precision Touchpads](https://www.howtogeek.com/286905/what-is-a-precision-touchpad-on-windows-pcs/). If your laptop does, you can configure tap-to-click and other touchpad settings directly in Windows 10’s Settings app.

How to Disable or Enable Tap to Click
-------------------------------------

To check whether these features are available on your PC, head to Settings > Devices > Touchpad. (You can quickly open the Settings app by pressing Windows+i on your keyboard.)

Under Taps, enable or disable the “Tap with a single finger to single-click,” “Tap with two fingers to right-click,” and “Tap twice and drag to multi-select” options. The exact options available will depend on your PC. But, if you don’t see them, your PC doesn’t have a Precision Touchpad, and these options must be configured elsewhere.

If you don’t see the options here, you can likely click “Additional settings” under Related Settings on the Touchpad settings pane.

This will generally open your touchpad’s settings panel in the old Mouse Properties window.
