If you enjoy snowboarding, then you likely want to learn some tricks and jumps! A frontside 360 is when you leave the slope and rotate in the air 360 degrees before hitting the ground again. The "frontside" part of the jump refers to the fact that you turn your chest toward the bottom of the slope first rather than your back. If you snowboard with your left side in front, then you turn counterclockwise; if you snowboard in the "goofy" position with your right side to the front, you turn clockwise. To land the jump, pop off the heel edge of your board into the air and use your arms, head, and torso to gain the momentum you need to rotate in the air. This jump can be difficult to master, so you may want to start with basic jumps, then 180s and 270s.

1.  Gather some speed to land the jump properly. This jump is actually easier to do if you're going a bit faster. That's because the speed gives you more air time, meaning you have longer to make the turn. Don't try to do this going very slowly.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   However, don't go fast that you feel out of control!
2.  Tip on your heel edge as you go down the slope. This prepares you to start turning back up the hill. Place your weight on your heels rather than the balls of your feet and tilt the board toward your heels, called the "heel edge" of the board.[\[2\]](#_note-2)
    
    [![Do a Frontside 360 on a Snowboard Step 2 Version 5.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/cc/Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-2-Version-5.jpg/aid22966-v4-728px-Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-2-Version-5.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-2-Version-5.jpg)
    
    *   It's important to use the edge of the board when doing a jump because it gives you something to push off of in the snow. It digs in, providing leverage.[\[3\]](#_note-3)
3.  Twist your arms towards the back of the board. Turn your upper body toward your back leg and move your arms around that direction. This movement is a way to "wind up" your body for the spin.[\[4\]](#_note-4)
    
    [![Do a Frontside 360 on a Snowboard Step 3 Version 5.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f0/Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-3-Version-5.jpg/aid22966-v4-728px-Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-3-Version-5.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-3-Version-5.jpg)
    
    *   So if your left side is facing front, twist your arms back to the right.
4.  Bend at the knees as you come into the turn. Bending down will help you get ready to make the jump into the air. You can also lean your torso over a bit. Basically, you're just getting ready to spring up as your board movement and arms propel you into the rotation.[\[5\]](#_note-5)
    
    [![Do a Frontside 360 on a Snowboard Step 4 Version 5.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b7/Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-4-Version-5.jpg/aid22966-v4-728px-Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-4-Version-5.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-4-Version-5.jpg)
    
    *   You don't need to crouch down too low. Just bend enough to make the jump.
5.  Turn back up the hill and swing your arms around. With the leg in front, begin turning the board to your backside, like you're about to go back up the hill. At the same time or just before, swing your arms around in the direction you want to go, which will help begin your rotation.[\[6\]](#_note-6)
    
    [![Do a Frontside 360 on a Snowboard Step 5 Version 5.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6e/Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-5-Version-5.jpg/aid22966-v4-728px-Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-5-Version-5.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-5-Version-5.jpg)
    
    *   So if your left side is in front, you'll turn back to the left.
    *   This is called a "frontside" 360 because you're turning the front of your body toward the downhill side of the slope first, rather than the back of your body. A backside would be if you had your left side in front and turned to the right first because you'd be flipping your back to the downhill side of the slope first.
6.  Pop up into the air as you make the turn. Use your legs to propel you upward just as you begin the rotation. Spring into the air, extending your body and locking your core as your torso lines up with the board below.[\[7\]](#_note-7) Try to jump as high as you can so you don't come down too quickly.[\[8\]](#_note-8)
    
    [![Do a Frontside 360 on a Snowboard Step 6 Version 5.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/58/Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-6-Version-5.jpg/aid22966-v4-728px-Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-6-Version-5.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-6-Version-5.jpg)
    
    *   Keep in mind, the slope will help you with your lift. As you pop off the edge of the board, you'll keep going straight out for a second while the ground slopes down.
7.  Continue looking over your shoulder through the whole move. As you start the rotation, look over your leading shoulder. This movement will also help get the rotation going, but you must keep doing it through the whole turn. Otherwise, you might not make it all the way around.[\[9\]](#_note-9)
    
    [![Do a Frontside 360 on a Snowboard Step 7 Version 5.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b7/Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-7-Version-5.jpg/aid22966-v4-728px-Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-7-Version-5.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-7-Version-5.jpg)
    
    *   You want to lead with your head and shoulders the whole time.
8.  Land on your toe edge. As you come around the rotation, you'll have a blind landing. Tip the board forward and extend your legs down to catch the ground. Bend your knees to absorb some of the impact as you hit the ground.[\[10\]](#_note-10)
    
    [![Do a Frontside 360 on a Snowboard Step 8 Version 5.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4d/Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-8-Version-5.jpg/aid22966-v4-728px-Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-8-Version-5.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-8-Version-5.jpg)
    
    *   If you've jumped high enough and used enough rotating force, you should be going down the slope when you land again.

  

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Working on Problem Areas")\]Working on Problem Areas

1.  Practice popping off the ground on the trampoline. One part of the move is lifting your snowboard off the ground so you have enough space to rotate in the air. If you're having trouble getting enough lift, take your snowboard on a trampoline. Work on jumping off the trampoline on your snowboard, and it will help you get a feel for the motion.[\[11\]](#_note-11)
    
    [![Do a Frontside 360 on a Snowboard Step 9 Version 5.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/17/Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-9-Version-5.jpg/aid22966-v4-728px-Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-9-Version-5.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-9-Version-5.jpg)
    
    *   Work on a large trampoline to make sure you have enough space, like the kind you see in tumbling gyms or trampoline parks.
    *   You can also practice this move on flat ground in the snow. Bend your knees and use that motion to push yourself off the ground. Lift your knees under you to give yourself more air.
2.  Use the trampoline to work on the twisting motion. With your snowboard on, start bouncing, gaining some air. As you come down on a jump, twist your arms around your body to the right. When you hit the trampoline, start moving your arms and your shoulders around to the left, which will help your whole body turn.[\[12\]](#_note-12)
    
    [![Do a Frontside 360 on a Snowboard Step 10 Version 5.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3d/Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-10-Version-5.jpg/aid22966-v4-728px-Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-10-Version-5.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-10-Version-5.jpg)
    
    *   Work on the trampoline until you can go all the way around.
3.  Try flatland frontside 360s to help you understand the movement. That is, instead of popping off the ground as you go into your rotation, simply spin around on the ground as you go down the slope. To make the spin, come in with your knees bent like you would for one in the air, but then extend your legs and straighten up your body for the rotation. On the way out of the rotation, bend your knees and torso back down slightly. That will help you get the feel for how you need to rotate once you get in the air.[\[13\]](#_note-13)
    
    [![Do a Frontside 360 on a Snowboard Step 11 Version 5.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/de/Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-11-Version-5.jpg/aid22966-v4-728px-Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-11-Version-5.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-11-Version-5.jpg)
    
    *   Once this rotation is smooth, you can try it in the air again.
    *   Don't forget the rotation movements with your arms and upper body! You won't turn if you don't start the rotation.
4.  Avoid rotating too early if you're not spinning all the way around. If you start rotating too much before you get off the ground, the friction of the board will slow your turn down. To make sure you get all the way around, try to time the rotation at about the same time as you lift off the ground.[\[14\]](#_note-14)
    
    [![Do a Frontside 360 on a Snowboard Step 12 Version 5.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d9/Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-12-Version-5.jpg/aid22966-v4-728px-Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-12-Version-5.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-12-Version-5.jpg)
    
5.  Keep the board level to not land on your butt. If you pop up and you're not level, you typically end up sliding into the ground as you finish the rotation. Try to tilt just a little bit forward with your torso as you go into the rotation and keep the board even with the horizon as it leaves the ground.[\[15\]](#_note-15)
    
    [![Do a Frontside 360 on a Snowboard Step 13 Version 5.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/47/Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-13-Version-5.jpg/aid22966-v4-728px-Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-13-Version-5.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-13-Version-5.jpg)
    
6.  Keep from over-rotating by waiting to spot the landing. This jump includes a blind landing. If you're trying to see it before the end of the rotation, you could spin too fast, resulting in a crash. Instead, keep your eyes in the direction of the toe edge of the board. Then you can see the landing point on the slope as you come around the rotation.[\[16\]](#_note-16)

1.  Do the move off a jump on the course. You definitely want to practice straight jumps first before trying a 360. However, once you get the hang of regular jumps, try adding the rotation. Aim to start your rotation right as you hit the takeoff of the jump, twisting your arms and board around to get your momentum going. Extend your legs at the takeoff to get the "pop" effect.[\[17\]](#_note-17)
    
    [![Do a Frontside 360 on a Snowboard Step 15 Version 5.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e1/Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-15-Version-5.jpg/aid22966-v4-728px-Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-15-Version-5.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-15-Version-5.jpg)
    
    *   Start with smaller course jumps and work your way up to bigger ones.
2.  Practice grabs on a trampoline with your snowboard. A grab is where you hold on to the edge of the board while you're in the air. Get on a trampoline with your snowboard on. Gain some air by jumping a few times, then work on bringing your board up for a front grab. Lift the toe edge of the board and grab it with your hand. Release it quickly and land on the bottom of the snowboard.[\[18\]](#_note-18)
    
    [![Do a Frontside 360 on a Snowboard Step 16 Version 5.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2d/Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-16-Version-5.jpg/aid22966-v4-728px-Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-16-Version-5.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-16-Version-5.jpg)
    
    *   You can also lean back and grab the heel edge of the board or tip the leading edge of the board up (usually your left side) and grab it with your left hand, which is a nose grab. Try the back end for a tail grab.
    *   You can use either end to grab the toe side or heel side of the board, but it will take different movements.
    *   Try combining this with the 360 rotation on the trampoline.
3.  Lift your knees in your frontside rotations to work on adding a grab. To start adding a grab on the slopes, work on lifting your knees while you are rotating. Tighten your body up so that you're almost in the fetal position.[\[19\]](#_note-19)
    
    [![Do a Frontside 360 on a Snowboard Step 17 Version 4.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/60/Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-17-Version-4.jpg/aid22966-v4-728px-Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-17-Version-4.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Do-a-Frontside-360-on-a-Snowboard-Step-17-Version-4.jpg)
    
    *   This movement brings the board closer to your hands, making it easier to perform a grab.
    *   To help make yourself compact, use a lot of force when you pop off the takeoff point of the jump. The hard pop will push your legs up toward your chest.
4.  Incorporate a grab on the slopes. After you get the feel for the movement, try it out while you make a rotation. Try starting with a straightforward jump, then try it with a 180 or a 270 before moving on to the 360. That way, you get a feel for it while lowering your chances of wiping out on the jump.[\[20\]](#_note-20)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Watch others hit the feature on the course to gauge the speed you need to clear the landing.
*   A common mistake is to start spinning while still on the feature, which causes you to lose stability in the air. Make sure that you take off of the lip straight.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Don't try this trick before you learn the basics. You can get seriously hurt on some of those big jumps, so take it easy if you're new to the sport.
*   Make sure to wear the proper safety gear, including headgear, to help lower the risk of injury.
