The Surya Namaskar (sun salutation) is a series of 12 yoga poses meant to give praise to the sun. Traditionally, you do these poses in the morning to greet the rising sun and celebrate the start of a new day. After you move through the poses, go back through the same poses in the opposite direction until you return to your beginning pose. The Surya Namaskar A is just one of many variants on this sequence.

1.  Start with the [mountain pose](https://www.wikihow.com/Do-a-Mountain-Pose-in-Yoga "Do a Mountain Pose in Yoga"). This pose is also known as the Tadasana Namaskar. Stand up straight and tall with your feet planted firmly on the floor, hip-distance apart. Balance your weight evenly on both feet. Let your hands hang at your sides with the palms facing forward and the fingers open, in a receiving position.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   Alternatively, you can bring your hands together in front of your chest in a prayer position. Press the tips of your thumbs against your sternum, over your heart chakra.[\[2\]](#_note-2)
    *   Once you are in the mountain pose, breathe slowly and steadily, and focus on finding your center.[\[3\]](#_note-3)
2.  Raise your arms in an upward salute (Urdhva Hastasana). Inhale deeply and look upward. Slowly raise your arms above your head with the palms together and your fingers pointing straight upward. Push your hips forward a little so that you enter a slight backbend.[\[4\]](#_note-4)

Place your hands flat on the floor, or rest them on a block if you cannot reach the floor.[\[5\]](#_note-5)

Raise your head so that you are looking slightly forward and unbend slightly at the hips so that your chest is no longer resting against your thighs. Keep your back flat and straight. Create a triangle between your feet, head, and hips.[\[6\]](#_note-6)
