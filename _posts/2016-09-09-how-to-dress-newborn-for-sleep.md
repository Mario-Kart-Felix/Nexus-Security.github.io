When it comes to dressing your newborn for bed, comfort is only a part of your considerations. The main concern is safety and reducing the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Even though you may have put a lot of time (and money) into your baby’s wardrobe, the truth is they don’t need a ton of different outfits for their first weeks of life. Selecting the right amount and type of clothing, ensuring your newborn’s safety, and establishing a healthy sleeping environment will give you peace of mind and allow your newborn to sleep comfortably and safely.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Dress-a-Newborn-for-Sleep&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Choosing a Base Layer")\]Choosing a Base Layer

1.  Choose a onesie and light pants during warm weather and a long-sleeved onesie and pants when it’s cold out. A base layer should be just that, a layer of clothes you put on your newborn before adding any additional garments. In warmer rooms, a short-sleeved onesie and light pants will provide enough warmth for your newborn. In cooler rooms, your newborn may need a long-sleeved onesie as a base layer.

2.  Select a fitted onesie or a wrap shirt as a base layer of clothing. Your newborn baby is not used to wearing clothes, and a onesie or a wrap shirt will stay in place and keep their tummy and back from being exposed. Plus, with the snaps at the bottom, you don’t have to completely undress your newborn when the inevitable diaper change comes around! [\[2\]](#_note-2)

    *   A kimono, or wrap-style shirt opens across the front, so you don’t have to pull the garment over your newborn’s head when changing, which can cause many newborns to fuss.
    *   Depending on the temperature, one layer may be all you need. You can use a long-sleeved onesie and add pants to create a warm base layer.
    *   In temperatures or above a short-sleeved base layer is best.
3.  Check your newborn’s skin to feel how warm or cold they are. You can get a good indication of how warm or cold your newborn is by feeling their skin in a few different places. Check your newborn’s hairline and back of the neck, as well as their extremities like hands and feet. Their skin shouldn’t feel too warm or too cold. Signs that your newborn may be too hot include flushed cheeks, fussiness, or a sweaty back.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

    *   As long as the newborn’s head and chest are warm, they should be warm. Newborns naturally have poor circulation and may have feet and hands that are cool to the touch, but this does not always mean they are cold!
    *   If your newborn’s feet feel too cold, you can put on socks or switch the onesie or wrap to one that has footies.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Dress-a-Newborn-for-Sleep&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Selecting a Covering and Accessories")\]Selecting a Covering and Accessories

1.  Add one additional layer than what you’re comfortable wearing in the room. This is a good rule of thumb when it comes to dressing your newborn. Layers make it easy to adjust your newborn’s sleepwear if you need to. People tend to overbundle their babies, so it’s important that you don’t overdo the layers and run the risk of your newborn overheating. [\[4\]](#_note-4)
    
    [![Dress a Newborn for Sleep Step 4.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/1f/Dress-a-Newborn-for-Sleep-Step-4.jpg/aid10980607-v4-728px-Dress-a-Newborn-for-Sleep-Step-4.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Dress-a-Newborn-for-Sleep-Step-4.jpg)
    
    *   If you are comfortable wearing a short-sleeved shirt, then choose a long-sleeved shirt and pants for your newborn.
    *   If you are wearing a sweater to be comfortable, then dress your newborn in a soft sweater over the shirt and onesie or wrap shirt.
    *   Cardigans with snaps rather than crew or V-necks with buttons or zippers make it easier to access and remove layers if needed.
    *   Note: mom’s temperature may fluctuate due to hormones and could affect how she senses temperature.
2.  Use a swaddle or a sleep sack instead of a blanket to wrap your newborn. Swaddling can help calm your newborn and allow them to sleep better by mimicking the feel of the womb.[\[5\]](#_note-5) It’s important to avoid clothing or material that can ride up over the newborn’s face and cause a choking hazard or increase the risk of SIDS. That’s where sleep sacks and swaddles can really help, keeping your baby feeling warm and secure! [\[6\]](#_note-6)
    
    [![Dress a Newborn for Sleep Step 5.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b6/Dress-a-Newborn-for-Sleep-Step-5.jpg/aid10980607-v4-728px-Dress-a-Newborn-for-Sleep-Step-5.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Dress-a-Newborn-for-Sleep-Step-5.jpg)
    
    *   Do not cover your newborn with a separate, loose blanket as that can cover their faces and pose a potential choking hazard as well.
    *   If you do use a sleep sack or wearable sleep blanket, be sure it doesn’t have a hood!
    *   Never use an electric blanket for your newborn baby.
    *   Check with your doctor for the proper and safe swaddling technique.
3.  Avoid putting hats or beanies on your newborn’s head. Newborn babies cool themselves down by releasing heat from their heads. Your newborn can quickly overheat if they fall asleep wearing a hat or beanie, so it’s important to keep their head uncovered while they sleep. Additionally, the headwear is a potential choking hazard in the crib.[\[7\]](#_note-7)

4.  Put mittens on your newborn to prevent them from scratching their face. Newborns can be very active while they sleep and may wriggle an arm or two free from their swaddle or sleep sack. They also can have sharp fingernails and can accidentally scratch their faces while they sleep. A pair of nice, soft mittens can remove the danger if it is a cause for concern![\[8\]](#_note-8)

1.  Set the room temperature to . This is the ideal room temperature range for your newborn baby. However, be sure to keep your newborn away from a direct fan, open window, or air conditioning vent.[\[9\]](#_note-9)
    
    [![Dress a Newborn for Sleep Step 9.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/23/Dress-a-Newborn-for-Sleep-Step-9.jpg/aid10980607-v4-728px-Dress-a-Newborn-for-Sleep-Step-9.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Dress-a-Newborn-for-Sleep-Step-9.jpg)
    
    *   If you do not have a thermostat, consider getting a thermometer to monitor the temperature of your newborn’s room.
2.  Use a fan or white noise machine to help your newborn sleep undisturbed. If your home is full of noise, it can hard for a newborn to fall asleep and stay asleep. An easy solution is to use a fan or a white noise machine to drown out any unwanted noises. This can also be helpful if you are traveling or sleeping somewhere other than your newborn’s home environment. While studies have shown that fans do not reduce the risk of SIDS, they can still help your newborn sleep peacefully.[\[10\]](#_note-10)
    
    [![Dress a Newborn for Sleep Step 10.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/33/Dress-a-Newborn-for-Sleep-Step-10.jpg/aid10980607-v4-728px-Dress-a-Newborn-for-Sleep-Step-10.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Dress-a-Newborn-for-Sleep-Step-10.jpg)
    
    *   If you do use a fan, do not place it right next to your newborn’s sensitive ears.
3.  Create a safe sleeping environment. Safety is the most important factor for your sleeping newborn. A safe sleeping environment is one that is free of any potential health and safety risks. Suffocation, choking and SIDS are all concerns that you should consider when designating your child’s sleeping space. [\[11\]](#_note-11)

    *   Choose a new crib or bassinet that meets the current safety standards.
    *   Choose a firm mattress and avoid soft mattress pads or memory foam.
    *   Only use tight-fitting sheets specifically designed for your mattress.
    *   Make sure there are no gaps between the mattress and the wall of the crib or bassinet.
    *   Make sure there are no extra blankets or accessories such as crib bumpers, pillows, wedges, or stuffed animals.
    *   Check for hazards such as curtain cords or baby monitor wires.
    *   Avoid letting pets, especially cats, near the sleeping space.
    *   While it is usually safe to use a pacifier for bed, never allow your newborn to fall asleep with a bottle.
    *   Newborns should always be placed on their back to sleep, even during nap times!
