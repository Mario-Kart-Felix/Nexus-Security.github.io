    *   If you don’t own a bike, look into bike-share programs in your community.[\[2\]](#_note-2)
    *   Get a rack, backpack, or a trailer if you need to carry things.
    *   If it's been a while since you've been on a bicycle, start by doing short, easy trips to gain confidence before you ride a long distance.
2.  Walk to your destination if it’s close enough. If you're traveling less than , enjoy some fresh air and walk to your destination. It's great exercise, and it offers a nice break from other fast-paced activities.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

    *   For example, if you live within of your place of work or school, then you could walk there.
    *   Make sure to use sidewalks, crosswalks, and other safe walking areas if you decide to walk to your destination.
3.  Take public transportation 1 or more days per week. Find out what the public transportation options are in your community and take advantage of them. You can use your bus or train time for things you couldn't do while driving. Read a book or magazine, sleep, catch up on your email, plan your day, learn a language, or do a portable craft, such as knitting or crocheting.[\[4\]](#_note-4)

    *   You can walk or bike to the bus stop, or drive to a park-and-ride lot
4.  [Carpool](https://www.wikihow.com/Carpool "Carpool") to work or school to reduce the environmental impact of driving. If you must drive to school or work every day, try taking along a few passengers. This is a great way to help other people cut back on their driving and reduce your impact on the environment. You can share the cost of gas, get some company on your commute, and you may be able to use a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane to save additional time.[\[5\]](#_note-5)

    *   Use apps to connect with neighbors with similar commute patterns.
    *   Check rideshare boards to identify people going your way if you are taking a longer drive or road trip.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Drive-Less&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Staying Closer to Home")\]Staying Closer to Home

1.  Choose destinations that are close to home whenever possible. Reducing the length of your trip to work, school, shopping, and wherever else you need to go is a painless, easy way to cut down on the time you spend in the car. It also makes it easier to use transportation other than driving when you don’t have far to go.[\[6\]](#_note-6)
    
    [![Drive Less Step 1.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/bb/Drive-Less-Step-1.jpg/aid8648383-v4-728px-Drive-Less-Step-1.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Drive-Less-Step-1.jpg)
    
    *   Try shopping for your groceries at a local supermarket rather than driving 20 miles to a major shopping center.
    *   Walk to a café in your neighborhood rather than driving through at a fast food restaurant to get coffee.
    *   You could even bike or walk to school or work if you live close enough.
2.  Do what you can online or by phone to avoid going out. Take advantage of websites where you can order items that you use frequently to cut down on your trips to the store. Comparison shop online rather than hunting all over town, or call merchants to ask about prices and availability before you go.[\[7\]](#_note-7)
    
    [![Drive Less Step 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/42/Drive-Less-Step-2.jpg/aid8648383-v4-728px-Drive-Less-Step-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Drive-Less-Step-2.jpg)
    
    *   For example, you could try ordering your groceries online and have them delivered to eliminate a trip to the store.
    *   Pay bills online or by phone rather than paying in person.
    *   Make check deposits using a banking app instead of driving to the bank.
3.  Ask your employer if you can [work from home](https://www.wikihow.com/Ask-to-Work-from-Home "Ask to Work from Home") 1 day per week. If you can perform your work remotely, then you might ask your employer about telecommuting. Not all jobs are suited to it, and not all managers and workplaces are willing to consider it, but if you can save on even 1 day's commute per week, it will add up.[\[8\]](#_note-8)
    
    [![Drive Less Step 5.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a1/Drive-Less-Step-5.jpg/aid8648383-v4-728px-Drive-Less-Step-5.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Drive-Less-Step-5.jpg)
    
    *   Try pointing out the perks of allowing you to work from home for 1 day of the week, such as increased productivity, higher morale, and reducing environmental impact by cutting back on your commute.
    *   Some people even find that they are more productive without all the distractions of a busy office.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Drive-Less&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Finding Little Ways to Reduce Driving Time")\]Finding Little Ways to Reduce Driving Time

1.  Combine errands and trips when you need to drive somewhere. If you need to drive somewhere, do your best to minimize the number of individual trips you need to make. Make a list of the places you need to go and what you need to get before you head out.[\[9\]](#_note-9)
    
    [![Drive Less Step 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c4/Drive-Less-Step-3.jpg/aid8648383-v4-728px-Drive-Less-Step-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Drive-Less-Step-3.jpg)
    
    *   Try to avoid driving back and forth across town as well. Stop at places on the way to and from your other destinations. For example, you could visit the post office or doctor while you're in that part of town, or stop by the store on your way home from work or school.
2.  Park in the first space that you find when you arrive at your destination. Instead of circling the parking lot looking for the perfect space, pull into the first available one even if it’s far from the entrance. You may reduce your time spent in the car by as much as 10 minutes by not circling for a closer spot, and you will get some extra steps in by parking further from the entrance. Parking further away even counts as part of your daily exercise![\[10\]](#_note-10)
    
    [![Drive Less Step 4.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/29/Drive-Less-Step-4.jpg/aid8648383-v4-728px-Drive-Less-Step-4.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Drive-Less-Step-4.jpg)
    
    *   If valet parking is an option at a crowded venue, then you might also try this option for parking. You usually have to pay for valet parking, but it might be worth it for the time and energy you could spend looking for a place to park.
3.  Use map and transit applications to plan your trips. Maps and apps can help you to shorten your route and avoid traffic slowdowns. Some map applications can also tell you where the roads are congested so you can avoid getting stuck in traffic. By following the app’s suggestions for alternative routes, you can cut back on the amount of time that you will spend behind the wheel.[\[11\]](#_note-11)
