Innovation and automation are everywhere in the many industries of the world. It's a wonder watching it but, with it stems some problems with more and more people being replaced with robots and having to re-train or enter another field. In order for people to do those things, most people often turn to go back to school rather than considering other options. While going back to school could be helpful, you can always consider learning how to educate yourself instead. Maybe a long time ago that option wasn't a reality, but with good quality information and other factors, educating yourself now is well worth considering. Even if you're not in the market for a new job.

What Does It Mean to Educate Yourself?
--------------------------------------

What it means to educate yourself is a matter of having a series of habits that promote how to educate yourself. Going into finer details, these habits comprise of a system to help you stay up on relevant topics that you are passionate about. As I mentioned earlier, this method has only sprung up in recent years as a valid option. The reason that's the case was that information wasn't readily available. Several decades ago, our information came from newspapers, radio, and television. But now, information is being created every single day by the thousands through blog posts run by professionals or large businesses. The quality of the information and the quantity of it has increased thanks to the Internet and further expansion of it. It's to the point what it means to educate yourself is leveraging the information on the Internet.

Can You Self-Educate without Going to College?
----------------------------------------------

Since the internet is the best way to gather information, it's totally possible to self-educate ourselves without going to college. Here are some ways to start off:

### 1\. Stay Current on Industry News

Not just the news of the industry you're in, but also in other areas you have an interest in. As I said, the industries are changing because there is always something happening. One way on how to educate yourself is being aware of what's going on in the industry. The only thing to keep in mind with this is there are many ways to stay caught up in the industry. You don't need to pay for subscriptions to several papers or magazines to stay caught up. Turn to social media and search for relevant hashtags or keywords, or sign up to news outlets mailing lists. There are plenty of free options.

### 2\. Sign Up for Online Courses

Information has become so abundant that there are all kinds of courses available. [Online learning](https://www.lifehack.org/856820/online-learning-effective) is also a really effective way to learn these days. Some options you can turn to are sites like [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) or [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/) which have thousands of courses available. Here're more sites for self-learning: [25 Killer Sites For Online Education](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/money/25-killer-sites-for-free-online-education.html) Some universities have even opened up courses online for free. One example of a site providing that is [edX](https://www.edx.org/) which has courses from MIT, Harvard, Berkeley University and others. And at Lifehack, we offer some [free classes](https://www.lifehack.org/free-classes) too.

### 3\. Get a Mentor

Every industry has skilled individuals who are willing to teach others. Backed by years of experience in the field, they can pass down valuable lessons that no other classroom could teach you. This is another strong method because a mentor is likely to stay ahead of the curve. Their years of experience and understanding of the industry can lead to more specific advice. After all, traditional colleges and universities tend to focus on widespread information rather than what you really need to know. A mentor is another way to get a personalized experience.

### 4\. Take Up an Arts Class

While some people think that arts of any sort are a waste of time or a joke, it's worth considering it seriously these days. Recall that innovation stems from people's ability to look at a problem and create creative solutions. Don't you think that requires some creative thinking? While you might not want to be an industry trendsetter, being artsy or creative can provide other benefits. Benefits that come to mind are:

*   **You can do this solo.** Done by yourself and taught by yourself has perks to it.
*   **It is cheap to do.** Want to be a better writer? Open up a document on your computer and start typing. You can do the same with any other device as well. Even if you're looking to draw or paint art supplies aren't that costly and you can pace yourself as much as you'd like.
*   **You could meet other people.** There are other writers, artists, singers and more in your town. It's a matter of looking around for them.
*   **You will learn new skills.** All of these mediums provide various skills when you look at them. Not only that but you can also learn about yourself through this medium too.

### 5\. Start Journalling

Even if the art stuff isn't something you're keen on, I'd at least suggest taking up journaling. Specifically journalling for the sake of reflecting. This doesn't mean you have to journal about your day, but rather focus on the information that you learned that day -- personal or otherwise. This is important because information only stays as relevant to us as long as we recall it and retain that information. With this in mind, you can use the journal to jot down big lessons that day, quotes, or other little tidbits of information you want to remember. After that, be sure to check that journal once a week to go over what you've learned.

### 6\. Always Be Looking Stuff Up

Google and Wikipedia are powerful sources of information. Make a point of using it every day at some capacity, especially if you've got a smartphone or you're around a computer. One other alternative to look at is bringing a dictionary or encyclopedia with you. The idea with this is to look up a new word and try to make a reference of it over the course of the day.

How to Learn Effectively as a Self-Learner
------------------------------------------

It's one thing to know how to educate yourself but it's another to be effective at it. Some strategies can be focusing on one of the activities above and spending only 15 minutes a day on that. However, there are other methods to consider to be an effective self-learner.

### Use the Sandbox Method

The first method I'll suggest is the Sandbox Method.((Nat Eliason: [Self-Education: Teach Yourself Anything with the Sandbox Method](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/self-education))) It's an ongoing process for self-education and is based on how we learn and process information. This method recognizes that we don't always need to memorize facts, formulas, or other specific bits of information. Instead, the method helps us to develop a deep understanding of the skills we're using and expose ourselves to a lot of information around that topic. We can then use that information to improve ourselves and to encourage further learning. Here is a breakdown of the method:

1.  **Build the sandbox.** What this means is determining where you're getting the information, and what the information is about. Your sandbox by the end should be cheap or free to do, have low-stakes, and have some public element to it.
2.  **Do the research**. Start off with how-to's and general information about the area you are learning. These get you to practicing your skills which give us a better grasp of the topic.
3.  **Implement and practice.** Once you've done the skill on your own, the next thing is to make it more public. For example, if you are wanting to learn how to bake, start baking goods for guests or for a party.
4.  **Get feedback.** Once you've done something, go back and do some more research. Keep filling in gaps of knowledge. Create your [feedback loop](https://www.lifehack.org/810913/how-to-learn). Maybe there is a better method to baking a pie? Or perhaps your form was off when lifting weights? Whatever the case is, you want to be certain you're doing it right or finding ways to improve your current performance.

Take Up These Learning Habits
-----------------------------

While the sandbox method is a great method, there are other alternatives. Namely strong habits that while alone may do little, but with many can give you a well-rounded learning experience. Here are some ideas that come to mind:

*   **Having a studying environment.** You don't have a classroom, so the next best thing is making a place you frequently go a place of study. It could be a library, a room in your home, or a cafe. Regardless, have a place where you can study and learn with purpose.
*   **Highlight information.** If you're the type to buy books or e-books, make use of highlighters. You can also consider other note-taking apps where you can store specific bits of information. Apps like Evernote or OneNote are great for that.
*   **Learning from various mediums.** There are 7 styles of learning we can use though we prefer only one or two of these methods most. [Figure out which ones you like](https://www.lifehack.org/850450/learning-process) and challenge yourself to learn in a different way.
*   **Set goals.** To get into learning as a lifestyle, it's important to keep up the habit. Goals are a good way of staying on track of the habits you want to have.
*   **Consider tutoring.** Not only can you get paid to tutor people, but this also reinforces things you learn as well. Tutoring is also a way to validate and reassure what you are learning is sticking with you too.

Final Thoughts
--------------

Being a self-learner is all about adopting and embracing various methods on how to educate yourself. While going to university are still valid options, the sheer amount of information available allows any person to learn about anything. So save yourself the massive time and money sink to go to university and consider these habits. These habits can pay off in big ways over time.
