Apple is proud of its various fonts. Sometimes, though, the default text size is hard to read on iPhone and iPad displays. However, you can enable a system-wide bold font and make text easier to read. Here’s how you do it.

Enable Bold Text
----------------

To get started, open the “Settings” app. If you can’t find it on your iPhone or iPad Home screen, swipe down on your display and search for it with [Spotlight](https://www.howtogeek.com/229060/how-to-use-spotlight-search-on-your-iphone-or-ipad/).

Next, scroll down and select “Display & Brightness.”

Lastly, scroll to the bottom of the menu, and then toggle-On “Bold Text.”

After you enable the “Bold Text” option, you should see a larger font in both first- and third-party apps on your iPhone or iPad. Keep in mind that not everything will display the bold font.

Adjust the Text Size
--------------------

If you want to make the bold text on your iPhone or iPad even easier to read, you can adjust the text size. You can use a built-in tool on your iPhone or iPad to scale text size manually.
