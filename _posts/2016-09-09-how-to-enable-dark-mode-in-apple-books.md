A full-fledged [system-wide dark mode](https://beebom.com/ios-13-dark-mode-vs-android-q-dark-mode/) seems to be an automatic choice when you want to turn the entire user-interface pitch black for an easier-on-the-eyes viewing. But there are a couple of problems which I’m sure many of you would have encountered. First, not all the apps and websites support the dark theme. And it kind of puts a spanner in the whole affair. Second, the per-app basis switch for dark and light mode is still a work in progress. A large number of popular apps are yet to get on board. Fortunately, that’s not the case with Apple Books as the app has embraced this feature in all its glory. Should you want to give it a chance to [enhance your reading pleasure](https://beebom.com/best-pocket-alternatives/), let me show you how you can enable dark mode in Apple Books on your iPhone/iPad and Mac.  

Turn on Dark Mode in Apple Books on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS
----------------------------------------------------------

  

Apple Book comes with multiple themes like dark, light, grey, and yellow to make reading a pleasing experience. So, based on your convenience, you can switch between light and dark modes in the stock book reading app on your iOS or macOS device. Save it for the times where you wish to use the black theme selectively without having to [trigger the system-wide dark mode](https://beebom.com/how-quickly-switch-between-dark-light-mode-mac/).

Now that you have got a good hang of the feature, make the most of it to boost your reading experience. While Apple Books may not be the most feature-rich app on the horizon unlike [Audible or Kobo Books](https://beebom.com/best-audible-alternatives/), it’s got enough to be a pretty handy asset for bibliophiles.
