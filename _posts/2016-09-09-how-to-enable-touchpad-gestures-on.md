For the past few months, Chrome OS has been getting a lot of proper laptop features that we have been asking for a long time. For instance, now you can use [full-fledged desktop apps using Linux](https://beebom.com/best-linux-apps-chromebook/) and play [games on Chromebooks using Steam](https://beebom.com/how-install-play-steam-games-chromebook/) as well. Apart from that, Chromebook now allows seamless sign-in using your Android device. All these features have matured [Chromebooks from a kid’s laptop](https://beebom.com/best-chromebooks-for-kids/) to a contender for the mainstream laptop market. And now finally, we have the touchpad gestures on Chromebook which have gone through a lot of improvements and additions. So, let’s go ahead and learn about the new touchpad gestures that are available on Chromebook right now.  

Enable Some Interesting Touchpad Gestures on Chromebook
-------------------------------------------------------

  

Chromebooks already have 3-finger swipe gestures for tab switching and overview menu, however, **some really cool gestures are disabled inside [Chrome Flags](https://beebom.com/google-chrome-flags/)**. So in this section, I am going to show you how to enable touchpad gestures for virtual desktops and pull-to-refresh feature on Chromebooks.  

1\. First of all, to enable touchpad gestures for virtual desktops, open `chrome://flags` and search for “virtual desk gestures”. You can also **copy and paste the below address on Chrome** to directly open the particular flag. Now, enable the flag and click on the “Restart” button.  

```
chrome://flags/#enable-virtual-desks-gestures
```

2\. After enabling this flag, now **you can swipe 4 fingers in the left or right direction to switch between virtual desktops**. That’s amazing, right? And the best part is that the transition is very smooth and works almost all the time.

3\. Next is the **“pull down to refresh” gesture.** While the 2-finger swipe is already enabled for going back or forward on Chrome OS, the refresh [gesture that we have on Android](https://beebom.com/cool-android-gestures-you-should-be-using/) is disabled. So to enable it, open the below flag on the Chrome browser. Now, enable the flag and restart your Chromebook.  

```
chrome://flags/#pull-to-refresh
```
