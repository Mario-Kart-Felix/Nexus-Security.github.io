In the backdrop of [rampant hacking](https://beebom.com/hacker-hacks-smart-home-google-nest/) and ever-mounting data tracking, an [additional layer of safeguard](https://beebom.com/best-antivirus-for-windows-10/) for sensitive information against unauthorized access has become indispensable. Of course, nothing can guarantee a full-proof shield against hackers these days. However, it always pays to have some extra cushion under the hood to prevent the unexpected from turning out to be a reality, doesn’t it? So, if the security of your major social accounts has been giving you sleepless nights and you don’t want your personal data to easily fall into wrong hands, make the most of two-factor authentication. If you don’t know where to begin, here is a rundown to help you enable two-factor authentication on your Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.  

Set Up Two-Factor Authentication for Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter Accounts
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

### So, How Does 2FA Work?

  

For those unfamiliar, 2FA adds an extra layer of shield to your account. Thus, even if someone is able to steal your password, the master key will still be with you. Once you have set up 2FA for your social accounts, the respective app will send you a verification code on your registered number or the authenticator app to verify the login attempt – every single time.  

So, if someone wants to break into your account, they must require the access of not only your ID, password but also the registered phone number/authenticator app i.e Google Authenticator (free for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en)) or the security key depending on whatever verification method you have chosen. To prevent account hacking, today most apps offer two-factor authentication.  

And most of them work almost the same way (_check out their respective settings > security/privacy_). In this guide, we are just going to focus on setting up 2FA for Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram accounts. That all being said, let’s get started!
