After the brouhaha over VoLTE, now it’s time for VoWiFi (Voice over WiFi, also called WiFi Calling) support on Android and iOS devices. VoLTE arrived with a promise that it will spur a new medium for crystal-clear communication, but it was marred by poor LTE reception inside buildings and non-availability of 4G in rural areas. However, with WiFi calling, the issue of strong signal reception and LTE requirement is gone. If you are connected to a WiFi network even with a weak signal, you can have clear voice communication. And the best part is that VoWiFi works even if you are on 2G, 3G or 4G. So if you want to learn how to enable WiFi Calling on Android and iOS devices, follow our guide. Along with that, learn more about device support and VoWiFi availability from Airtel and Jio.

As we all know, Android smartphones have different UI skins so the process will be slightly different from one device to another. We will begin with **OnePlus devices first and then go through Samsung, Xiaomi, Realme, Nokia** and learn how to enable WiFi calling on these Android devices. In case, your Android device is not mentioned in this article, you can head over to [Airtel](https://www.airtel.in/wifi-calling) and [Jio](https://www.jio.com/en-in/jio-wifi-calling) websites to find device-specific information about VoWiFi. Now without any delay, let’s get started.
