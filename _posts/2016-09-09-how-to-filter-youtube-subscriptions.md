If you love watching YouTube videos, you may have subscribed to a ton of channels like [our own YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvpfclapgcuJo0M_x65pfRw). But did you ever wish you had a better way to customize the subscriptions feed than the long-existing reverse chronological order that often seems chaotic? I mean, wouldn’t it be better if you could customize your feed to show only the latest videos or the ones that you couldn’t finish off due to hectic schedules? Most probably, you would. Turns out, [Google](https://beebom.com/google-page/) has already found a nice way to let you filter your YouTube subscriptions feed on iPhone and iPad. Should you wish to give this all-new feature a shot, now is the right time to get started!  

Filter Subscriptions Feed on YouTube for iPhone and iPad
--------------------------------------------------------

  

YouTube app for iOS was recently updated to add a new feature called “Topics” to help users catch up with their favorite creators. With multiple filtering options, it enables them to fine-tune the subscriptions feed as per their specific taste. What’s more, it also offers a way to make the feed show only videos or both videos and community posts.  

1\. Ensure that your device is [running the latest version](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/youtube-watch-listen-stream/id544007664) of the **YouTube** app. (open App Store -> Profile -> find YouTube and update it as usual). After you have updated the app, launch it and tap on the **Subscriptions** tab at the bottom.

2\. Now, you should see **multiple filters in the top row of followed channels.**

*   _**All:** It’s selected by default and shows all the videos from channels you have subscribed to._
  
*   _**Today:** It displays all the videos published within the past 24 hours._
  
*   _**Continue Watching:** It shows the videos that you are yet to finish off._
  
*   _**Unwatched:** It lists out all the videos that you haven’t watched as yet. _
  
*   _**Live:** It displays [live streaming](https://beebom.com/how-schedule-livestream-youtube/) videos and YouTube Premieres. _
  
*   _**Posts:** It lines up community posts from the channels you have subscribed to. _
  

Select your preferred option and you are ready to go. Going forward, the app will list out videos based on how you have filtered your subscriptions.  

If you ever wished to go back to the old reverse chronological order, tap on the **Subscriptions** tab and choose **All** option.  

Make YouTube Subscription Feed Show Both Videos and Posts or Only Videos
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

1\. Launch the **YouTube** app on your device -> **Subscriptions** tab.

So, that’s how you can fine-tune YouTube subscriptions feed on your iOS device to not only access your favorite videos easily but also keep the unwanted ones away. As someone who heavily relies on fun-loving YouTube videos to bust stress, I give it a thumbs up. What about you? Not too long ago, the app added an equally impressive [voice-search feature](https://beebom.com/how-use-youtubes-voice-search-feature/) that makes searching for content pretty simple especially when casting YouTube videos to a [smart TV](https://beebom.com/best-4k-tvs-india/).
