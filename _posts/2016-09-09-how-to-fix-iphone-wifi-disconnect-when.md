So, based on my experience, I would suggest you try it out as well.

Renew the Lease
---------------

  

If the above step doesn’t solve your problem, you should try renewing the lease of your network. When you connect to a Wi-Fi network, you are given an IP address that identifies your device on the network. What renewing the lease does is that it reassigns the IP address and renews the wireless connection to the network. For me, this process has had a significant success rate in solving the “Fix iPhone WiFi disconnects issues”. To renew the lease of your network, launch the Settings app and then go to WiFi and** tap on the information button right next to the Wi-Fi network. **Now scroll down to find the “Renew Lease” button and tap on it.
