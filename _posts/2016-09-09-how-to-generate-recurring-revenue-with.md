As a [WooCommerce](https://wpmayor.com/link/woocommerce/) store owner, understanding your customer’s needs is crucial for your business. Knowing them will help you provide better service and adjust your offerings to boost customer satisfaction and improve sales. The mantra is, make your customers happy, and you will make your store successful.

An often effective yet less common [approach to growing your business](https://wpmayor.com/5-ways-to-sell-more-woocommerce-products/) is to adopt the subscription business model. A subscription model helps establish a recurring revenue stream, the kind that will ensure you more stability and a good foundation for success.

Why is Recurring Revenue Important for your Business?
-----------------------------------------------------

[Recurring revenue](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recurringrevenue.asp) is monthly or yearly income that is stable, predictable and has a large probability of continuing in the future. It can be generated with membership sites, subscriptions, instalments, etc.

Generating recurring revenue guarantees stability, and gives you the comfort to provide better service or improve your product.

Stability comes from the predictability of recurring revenue. We can predict how much money we will be making in a given time period. Also, we know which customers we can count on. So, we can give our best to make them happy, satisfied, and loyal.

There are several ways of monetization that generate recurring revenue, and the most common is [_subscriptions_](https://wpmayor.com/woocommerce-subscriptions/). The subscription business model is used by several successful companies who have recognized the [benefits of generating recurring revenue](https://www.inc.com/bob-house/need-to-increase-business-value-recurring-revenue-.html). And they use it for creating additional value – both for themselves and for their customers.

The Subscription Business Model Advantages
------------------------------------------

The [subscription business model](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042715/how-do-subscription-business-models-work.asp) comes with a lot of perks. Hence, right from daily use products, such as groceries, personal care items, to on-demand services, a subscription option is a popular strategy to register customers and earn their loyalty. The most popular examples being Amazon (subscribe and save), Netflix, the Dollar Shave Club, and BirchBox.

Companies rely on this business model, mostly because it helps them:

*   generate recurring revenue and provide greater stability,
*   increase customer engagement and CLV (customer lifetime value),
*   better know their customers and understand their needs,
*   enable customers to choose or create the options that best suit their needs,
*   make existing customers happy and potential ones interested in long-term cooperation,
*   support scalability and enable faster achievement of business goals

All of these advantages make the subscription model attractive. But adding personalization to the mix makes subscriptions irresistible for buyers.

Tapping into the Power of Subscription Boxes
--------------------------------------------

Customers want to feel special attention is being paid to them. They seek understanding, compassion, and dedication. More importantly, they seek more flexibility in the buying process.

[Subscription boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_box) are a great way to build stronger relationships with your customers and to make them feel special. Subscription boxes allow for a personalized buying experience wherein the buying process easier and customers more satisfied with the choices they make.

The product bundles can be an excellent part of your marketing strategy. You can get to know customer interests and plan your inventory accordingly. The fact that the products are delivered in a box is to offer additional value to your buyers. It is a special kind of shopping experience that makes customers feel excited, curious, and special.

These could be pre-made boxes, and boxes assorted by the customers, or custom product bundles.

To give your customers an option to create custom product bundles is a really great idea, and something they are bound to appreciate. After all, you can’t put all your customers ‘in the same box’, so why give them only one box option to use?

Combining Custom Product Bundles and Subscriptions
--------------------------------------------------

If you have a [WooCommerce](https://wpmayor.com/link/woocommerce/) store, you can use subscription boxes as a great way of creating recurring revenue and for overpowering the competition.

The [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/?aff=220) plugin offers excellent options for subscription management. No matter what kind off products (or services) you offer, this plugin takes care of the subscription process.

When it comes to creating and selling subscription boxes, you’ll need the [WISDM Custom Product Boxes](https://wisdmlabs.com/assorted-bundles-woocommerce-custom-product-boxes-plugin/?ref=13) plugin. This plugin is compatible with WooCommerce Subscriptions plugin and is the perfect solution for those looking to offer product bundles on a subscription basis.

*   allow customers to create their own personalized product boxes
*   set a fixed price or calculate the box price based on products added to it (dynamic pricing)
*   allow customers to purchase the box as a gift (gift-wrapped with a personalized message)
*   let customers subscribe to the custom product boxes on a timely basis
