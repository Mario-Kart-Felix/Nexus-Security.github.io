If you’re planning to visit Bali, your best bet is to hire a professional driver and car to take you around the beautiful Indonesian island. You can also hop in a taxi or shuttle bus to make your way between destinations, or ride a _bemo_ or _ojek_ like a local. While renting a car or motorcycle can seem like an exciting way to embrace your adventurous spirit, be mindful of the unpredictable nature of local traffic before getting the keys to a local vehicle. Publicly and privately operated ferries and boat tours will enable you to visit the surrounding islands.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Get-Around-Bali&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Reserving a Car")\]Reserving a Car

1.  Hire a professional driver and car for safety and convenience. This is by far the most straightforward and secure way to get around Bali. Your hotel may have a car service, or you can seek out a commercial car company to book a driver for a day or a week. The cost of the car, insurance, and gasoline will typically be included in the daily rate, and you’ll also be responsible for covering the driver’s accommodations and food. Expect to pay between Rp 350,000 and Rp 450,000 per day in total, but know that the rate may be negotiable with the driver.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   If your itinerary calls for an overnight stay, the driver will typically find their own lodging and meals. You’ll be responsible for paying, but this shouldn’t result in a large additional cost. Discuss the plan and agree on a per diem rate in advance.
    *   Having access to a professional driver’s advice can be very useful. For instance, they can point you in the right direction once you’re on foot. They might also be able to translate local terms or explain unfamiliar customs.
2.  Hail a metered taxi for day trips or cross-town transportation. You can call ahead to book taxi services, or hail an empty cab when you need a ride. The meter will start at Rp 5,000 for the initial of your trip. After this point it will increase to Rp 5,000 per that follows. You can also discuss booking a taxi for the day. Agree on the rate and specific services with the driver ahead of time. For instance, you might want to do a day trip or drive you around the city to see the local sights.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

    *   Bali cab companies include Blue Bird Taxi, Golden Bird Bali, Komotra Taxi, Ngurah Rai Taxi, and Wahana Taxi.
3.  Request a car through the Grab ridesharing app. Load up your smartphone with a local SIM card for data access and download the Grab app. Select your current location and desired destination to request a ride. You may add your payment information to the app, but there are also options to pay by cash or card as you would in a taxi.[\[3\]](#_note-3)
    
    [![Get Around Bali Step 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/7c/Get-Around-Bali-Step-3.jpg/aid11005049-v4-728px-Get-Around-Bali-Step-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Get-Around-Bali-Step-3.jpg)
    
    *   Note that ridesharing apps have been met with resistance in Bali and pickups are permitted in certain areas. For instance, your hotel may not allow Grab pickups and drop-offs on their premises. Pick a spot down the street instead to avoid a confrontation.
    *   Uber had a short-lived existence in Bali. However, they sold their market share to Grab and no longer operate on the island.[\[4\]](#_note-4)
4.  Reserve a rental car if you want to drive yourself around. Legally, you’re required to own an international driver’s license or a local permit to drive in Bali. You can find international rental car companies including Avis, Budget, and Hertz at the Ngurah Rai International Airport as well as popular resort cities.[\[5\]](#_note-5) Daily rates may range from $20 to $50 USD or more. Make sure insurance is included when you book your car.
    
    [![Get Around Bali Step 4.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8a/Get-Around-Bali-Step-4.jpg/aid11005049-v4-728px-Get-Around-Bali-Step-4.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Get-Around-Bali-Step-4.jpg)
    
    *   You can get a tourist’s driving permit issued at the Foreign License Service in Denpasar for Rp 150,000. You’ll need to show your passport and a driver’s license from your country of residence.[\[6\]](#_note-6)
    *   Be aware that driving in Bali can be challenging and risky for visitors. If you do decide to drive a rental car, be prepared to make sudden stops and stay attentive.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Get-Around-Bali&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Riding Bicycles and Motorcycles")\]Riding Bicycles and Motorcycles

1.  Ride pedal bicycle to get some exercise while you travel. Bike rentals start around Rp 30,000 per day. A bicycle, or _sepeda,_ provides independence as well as an on-the-go workout. Ask your hotel about the nearest bike rental company, and make sure the bike you choose is in good condition. Obtain a well-fitting helmet and test the bike’s steering, brakes, tire pressure, and gears before you set out on your journey.[\[7\]](#_note-7)
    
    [![Get Around Bali Step 5.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/fd/Get-Around-Bali-Step-5.jpg/aid11005049-v4-728px-Get-Around-Bali-Step-5.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Get-Around-Bali-Step-5.jpg)
    
    *   Although traffic in Bali can be difficult for an inexperienced visitor to navigate, a pedal bike is a safer alternative to rental cars and motorcycles.
2.  Rent a motorcycle or scooter to ride around Bali. You can rent out a scooter or motorcycle from a number of local vendors. Daily rates cost around Rp 50,000. Ensure that the vehicle is in working order, with good brakes, tires, and lights, and that you have the correct insurance and license documentation. You will also be provided with a helmet which should fit snugly.[\[8\]](#_note-8)
    
    [![Get Around Bali Step 6.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/de/Get-Around-Bali-Step-6.jpg/aid11005049-v4-728px-Get-Around-Bali-Step-6.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Get-Around-Bali-Step-6.jpg)
    
    *   A safety helmet is a must-have and should fit correctly. If the rental company doesn’t have any that fit you, purchase one that does from another vendor before riding the bike.
3.  Hail an _ojek_ and get around on the back of a motorcycle taxi. Operating in a slightly more informal system, _ojeks_ are motorcycles that accept paying passengers. If you give the impression that you’re looking for a ride when standing on the side of the road, you may receive offers from _ojek_ drivers. Or, you can download the Go-Jek mobile app to request a ride.[\[9\]](#_note-9) You’ll negotiate a fair with the driver, but expect to pay around Rp 30,000 for a trip.
    
    [![Get Around Bali Step 7.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9b/Get-Around-Bali-Step-7.jpg/aid11005049-v4-728px-Get-Around-Bali-Step-7.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Get-Around-Bali-Step-7.jpg)
    
    *   _Ojeks_ can be particularly useful for scooting around country roadways.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Get-Around-Bali&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Taking a Bus or Boat")\]Taking a Bus or Boat

1.  Book a shuttle bus or private tour via Perama Tour and Travel. Perama operates shuttle bus services throughout Bali’s major towns, as well as regional tours, airport transfers, and daily destination tours.[\[10\]](#_note-10) Perama buses are comfortable and safe. Rates are affordable although the trips tend to be slow.[\[11\]](#_note-11)
    
    [![Get Around Bali Step 8.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/bc/Get-Around-Bali-Step-8.jpg/aid11005049-v4-728px-Get-Around-Bali-Step-8.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Get-Around-Bali-Step-8.jpg)
    
    *   Note that the buses don’t stop along the way for small villages or detours to local sights.
    *   You can explore the options online and plan your trip in advance.
2.  Ride a public Kura-Kura shuttle bus and travel in comfort. Kura-Kura operates 5 lines around Bali. Its fleet of buses painted like green and yellow turtles allows for easy travel across the major tourist sites. The buses are comfortably equipped with air conditioning and free wi-fi. Luggage racks and straightforward AV announcement systems onboard are especially useful for travelers. Single trip fares can range from Rp 20,000 to Rp 80,000.[\[12\]](#_note-12)
    
    [![Get Around Bali Step 9.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/53/Get-Around-Bali-Step-9.jpg/aid11005049-v4-728px-Get-Around-Bali-Step-9.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Get-Around-Bali-Step-9.jpg)
    
    *   Look at the route schedule ahead of time to plan your trip. Although departure intervals are regular, some routes depart once every couple of hours.
3.  Hop on a public _bemo_ to travel like a local. Once the most popular form of public transit, _bemos_ are open-air mini buses or vans that hold a dozen passengers on bench seats. However, the system isn’t too tourist-friendly and the vehicles can be very cramped.[\[13\]](#_note-13) But if you want to travel like a local, raise your hand to hail the _bemo_ and feel free to hop off at any point.
    
    [![Get Around Bali Step 10.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/15/Get-Around-Bali-Step-10.jpg/aid11005049-v4-728px-Get-Around-Bali-Step-10.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Get-Around-Bali-Step-10.jpg)
    
    *   Fares can run upwards of Rp 4,000, although obvious tourists are often charged more.[\[14\]](#_note-14)
    *   Passengers are charged more for luggage.
4.  Take a commercial tour boat to travel the region by water. Companies including Perama Tour and Travel and Blue Water Express operate boat tours to popular spots on neighboring islands. These routes can be quick and direct and offer scenic views of Bali.[\[15\]](#_note-15)
    
    [![Get Around Bali Step 11.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/7a/Get-Around-Bali-Step-11.jpg/aid11005049-v4-728px-Get-Around-Bali-Step-11.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Get-Around-Bali-Step-11.jpg)
    
    *   Note that safety regulations and training are lacking across public and private boat operators. Assess the boat for safety equipment and exits. If something seems unsafe, get back on land and seek out another option.
5.  Hop on a public ferry to visit neighboring islands. Public ferries offer similar services to commercial boat tours, but at cheaper rates. Note that these may not necessarily be safer or than commercial options.
    
    [![Get Around Bali Step 12.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/fa/Get-Around-Bali-Step-12.jpg/aid11005049-v4-728px-Get-Around-Bali-Step-12.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Get-Around-Bali-Step-12.jpg)
    
    *   Waters can be turbulent and uncomfortable in small vessels. Opt for a boat with no less than 30 seats, rather than a small speedboat.[\[16\]](#_note-16)
