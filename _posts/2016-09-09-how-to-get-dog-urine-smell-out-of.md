    *   You can buy a spray bottle or you can use an empty one from an old cleaning solution.
    *   If you use a spray bottle that had something else in it previously, make sure to wash it out thoroughly before adding the new mixture. You don’t want to stain or contaminate your carpet with any unknown chemicals.
2.  Spray the mixture on the urine stain and let it sit for 15 minutes. Hold the spray bottle over your carpet and pull the trigger to apply the solution. Coat the entire stain with the solution so your carpet is completely saturated, and then let it soak in for 15 minutes.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

    *   Vinegar works great on dry or wet urine stains.
    *   Don’t pat the vinegar dry immediately since it needs to soak into the pad underneath the carpet to fully eliminate the odor.
3.  Dab the carpet to lift up excess vinegar. Use an old cleaning cloth or sponge and press onto the vinegar to soak up the liquid. Work across the entire stain so the carpet isn’t soaking wet. When you’re finished, immediately wash the cloth or throw it away.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

    *   Wear cleaning gloves if you don’t want to get any vinegar or urine on your hands while you’re working.
4.  Cover the vinegar solution with baking soda to deodorize your carpet. Coat the entire surface of the stain with a thin layer of baking soda and press it into the fabric with a cloth. Once the baking soda is applied, let it sit to pull out the moisture and odor from deep in your carpet. The baking soda will work back up toward the surface and form a thin crust on your carpet.[\[4\]](#_note-4)
    
    [![Get Dog Urine Smell out of Carpets Step 4 Version 4.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e8/Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-4-Version-4.jpg/aid1270719-v4-728px-Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-4-Version-4.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-4-Version-4.jpg)
    
    *   If you’re worried about the vinegar and baking soda changing the color of your carpet, test the mixture in a small, inconspicuous area before covering the stain.
    *   For an extra odor-fighting boost, mix a few drops of your favorite essential oil with the baking soda before sprinkling it on. Tea tree, lavender, or lemongrass oil are all good options.
5.  Vacuum the baking soda once it’s dry. When the baking soda is completely dry, run your vacuum over the area to lift it out of your carpet. Go over the spot multiple times to get any baking soda that’s deep in the carpet. When you’re finished, smell the area that was stained to see if there’s still a urine scent.[\[5\]](#_note-5)

    *   If you still smell urine, you can apply the solution again or try another cleaning method.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Applying a Hydrogen Peroxide Paste")\]Applying a Hydrogen Peroxide Paste

1.  Mix hydrogen peroxide, dishwashing detergent, and baking soda. Combine of hydrogen peroxide, of liquid dish soap, and 2 tablespoons (28 g) of baking soda in a plastic bowl and stir it together. The mixture will form a thick paste and start bubbling as they react with one another. Keep stirring the mixture until it’s thoroughly mixed.[\[6\]](#_note-6)
    
    [![Get Dog Urine Smell out of Carpets Step 6 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/91/Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/aid1270719-v4-728px-Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-6-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-6-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   Hydrogen peroxide works best on light-colored carpets. If you want to use it to clean dark carpets, test a small amount on your carpet to see if it affects the color.
    *   You can use hydrogen peroxide on fresh or dry urine stains.
2.  Apply the paste to the urine stain with a spoon and leave it for up to 1 hour. Use a spoon to scoop and spread the paste onto the urine stain. Press down on the paste to work it into the carpet so it can lift the odor from the pad underneath. Once you’ve spread the paste on the whole stain, leave it alone for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.[\[7\]](#_note-7)
    
    [![Get Dog Urine Smell out of Carpets Step 7 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8b/Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/aid1270719-v4-728px-Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-7-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-7-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   The baking soda and hydrogen peroxide react with one another and will trap the urine odor so your carpet doesn’t smell.
    *   The odor is more likely to go away if you leave the peroxide for longer.
3.  Dab the paste off your carpet with a wet cloth. Wet a cleaning cloth with the warmest water you can handle and wring it out so it isn’t dripping wet. Push the cloth firmly onto the paste to lift it out of your carpet. Rewet the cleaning cloth if it dries out, and keep dabbing the stain until you remove as much of the paste as you can.[\[8\]](#_note-8)
    
    [![Get Dog Urine Smell out of Carpets Step 8 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3f/Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-8-Version-3.jpg/aid1270719-v4-728px-Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-8-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-8-Version-3.jpg)
    
4.  Dry your carpet with paper towels. Once you remove the paste, place a layer of paper towels over the wet spot and press down to absorb any leftover liquid. Avoid wiping the paper towel from side to side so you don’t work it back into the carpet.[\[9\]](#_note-9)
    
    [![Get Dog Urine Smell out of Carpets Step 9 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/99/Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-9-Version-3.jpg/aid1270719-v4-728px-Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-9-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-9-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   You can also use a cleaning cloth instead of paper towels if you want.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Using Club Soda")\]Using Club Soda

1.  Pour club soda over the entire stain. Use a small amount at a time so your carpet doesn’t get soaking wet. Slowly pour the club soda over the entire stain so it bubbles and soaks into your carpet. Once the stain is covered with club soda, let it sit for about 10-15 minutes so it can penetrate the pad underneath.[\[10\]](#_note-10)
    
    [![Get Dog Urine Smell out of Carpets Step 10 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/89/Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-10-Version-3.jpg/aid1270719-v4-728px-Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-10-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-10-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   You can buy club soda from any grocery store.
    *   Club soda works best for fresh urine stains.
2.  Blot the stain with a cleaning cloth or sponge. After 10-15 minutes has passed, set a cleaning rag on top of the stain and press firmly onto it to lift out the soda. If the cloth gets too wet, wring it out or use another to lift the odor out. Work your way over the entire stain until most of the soda is lifted up.[\[11\]](#_note-11)
    
    [![Get Dog Urine Smell out of Carpets Step 11 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/41/Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-11-Version-3.jpg/aid1270719-v4-728px-Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-11-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-11-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   Don’t wipe back and forth over the stain or else the urine smell will work back into the carpet.
3.  Dry the area with paper towels. Cover the stain with 2 layers of paper towels and pat it dry. Push down hard with your hand to absorb any club soda that’s deep within the carpet pad. Keep pressing down across the entirety of the stain until you can’t pull up any more liquid.[\[12\]](#_note-12)
    
    [![Get Dog Urine Smell out of Carpets Step 12 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2b/Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-12-Version-3.jpg/aid1270719-v4-728px-Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-12-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-12-Version-3.jpg)
    
4.  Spray an air freshener on your carpet to get a refreshing odor. Using club soda will remove the odor, but you may have a stronger smell when you first remove it. Pick your favorite scent of air freshener or essential oil and spray it on your carpet to cover up any residual odor that the soda brought up. Spritz enough to mask the smell and then check your carpet in a few hours to see if you can still smell the urine.[\[13\]](#_note-13)
    
    [![Get Dog Urine Smell out of Carpets Step 13 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/22/Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-13-Version-3.jpg/aid1270719-v4-728px-Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-13-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-13-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   Look for air fresheners that eliminate odors rather than cover them up since they kill odor-causing bacteria.
    *   If you still smell urine, you may need to try a stronger cleaning method.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Spraying an Enzymatic Cleaner")\]Spraying an Enzymatic Cleaner

1.  Dry as much of the urine as you can with paper towels. Set a layer of paper towels over the stain, and firmly press the paper towel onto the carpet. Don’t scrub the carpet since it could work the urine deeper into the pad underneath. Keep dabbing the carpet until it’s as dry as you can get it.[\[14\]](#_note-14)
    
    [![Get Dog Urine Smell out of Carpets Step 14 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/94/Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-14-Version-3.jpg/aid1270719-v4-728px-Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-14-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-14-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   Enzymatic cleaners work best on fresh stains.
    *   Step on the paper towel to apply more pressure and absorb more liquid.
2.  Spray the enzymatic cleaner directly on the stain. Get a bottle of commercial enzymatic cleaner from your local supermarket. Hold the bottle from the stain and spray it until the carpet is saturated completely.[\[15\]](#_note-15)
    
    [![Get Dog Urine Smell out of Carpets Step 15 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a6/Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-15-Version-3.jpg/aid1270719-v4-728px-Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-15-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Get-Dog-Urine-Smell-out-of-Carpets-Step-15-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   Many pet stores carry enzymatic cleaners specifically made for dog urine.
3.  Let the cleaner soak into your carpet and dry on its own. Look on the bottle to see how long the enzymatic cleaner takes to work, which is usually up to 24 hours. Let the cleaner soak and absorb into the carpet so it can eliminate the odor completely. Once the time listed on the packaging passes, sniff your carpet to see if still smells.[\[16\]](#_note-16)
