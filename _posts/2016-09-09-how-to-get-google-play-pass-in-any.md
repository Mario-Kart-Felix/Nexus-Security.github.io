Since Google Play Pass is officially available in the US only, we need to change the Google Play Store country to the US. However, there are three points to keep in mind before going ahead. If you are fine with the below conditions then go ahead and get Play Pass right now.  

*   After moving to the US Play Store, you won’t be able to change the country back to your old country until a year.
  
*   You can only change the Play Store country once a year.
  
*   You can’t change the country if you are already part of Google Play Family Library. So in order to get Play Pass, you need to leave your current Google Family setup.
