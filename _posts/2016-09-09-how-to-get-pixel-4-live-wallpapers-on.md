Google Pixel 4 is perhaps the most leaked phone ever and unsurprisingly, it keeps happening year after year. From [complete specs](https://beebom.com/pixel-4-4xl-specs/) to hands-on videos, every single thing is out in the public. In addition, developers have managed to run some of the exclusive Pixel 4 features on other Android devices. Yes, we are talking about the Pixel 4 live wallpapers. In this article, I am going to show how you can get the Pixel 4 live wallpapers on any Android device and run it without any lag or jitter. With that said, let’s jump right in and learn about the steps.  

Install Pixel 4 Live Wallpapers
-------------------------------

  

The Pixel 4 Live Wallpaper has been modded by Pranav Pandey, an Android developer who has been doing this for the past few years. Thanks to his effort, the modded APK is **compatible with Android 7 (Nougat) and above** so the majority of modern smartphones can run the live wallpapers without any issues. Also, we did our testing on OnePlus 7T where it worked like a charm but stuttered a bit on Mi A1 due to its dated hardware. With that said, let’s go through the steps.  

1\. First of all, **download the Wallpapers app** ([Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.wallpaper&hl=en_IN)) from the Play Store. It’s developed by Google and we need this app to access the live wallpapers.  

2\. Now, download the Pixel 4 Live Wallpaper APK from [APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/pranav-pandey/port-app-7-0-google-pixel-4-xl-pixel-wallpapers-19/pixel-wallpapers-19-2-10-pp-7-0-arm64-release/pixel-wallpapers-19-10-pp-7-0-arm64-android-apk-download/) and install it on your Android smartphone. The system might block the installation since the app is from a third-party store. So to **allow the installation**, tap on Settings and enable the toggle.

3\. After the successful installation, open the Google Wallpapers app from the app drawer. Now, **scroll down and you will find the “Live Wallpapers”** section. Tap on it and you will find all the Pixel 4 live wallpapers in action.

4\. Select your preferred wallpaper and **tap on the “Set Wallpaper” button** to make it your home and lock screen wallpaper. I particularly love the Doodle one for its minimalistic and non-intensive animation.

5\. **If you are running Android 10**, you can even customize live wallpapers based on various patterns available inside each wallpaper. Enjoy!
