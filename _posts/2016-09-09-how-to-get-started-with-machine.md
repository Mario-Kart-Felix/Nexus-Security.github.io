[How-to Get Started with Machine Learning on Arduino](https://medium.com/tensorflow/how-to-get-started-with-machine-learning-on-arduino-7daf95b4157).

> Arduino is on a mission to make machine learning simple enough for anyone to use. We’ve been working with the TensorFlow Lite team over the past few months and are excited to show you what we’ve been up to together: bringing TensorFlow Lite Micro to the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense. In this article, we’ll show you how to install and run several new TensorFlow Lite Micro examples that are now available in the Arduino Library Manager.
> 
> The first tutorial below shows you how to install a neural network on your Arduino board to recognize simple voice commands.

Arduino also has a [blog post](https://blog.arduino.cc/2019/10/15/get-started-with-machine-learning-on-arduino/) on this as well & [GitHub](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoTensorFlowLiteTutorials).

This is cool, we’ll adapt these so they work with speakers, screens, etc. on the [Adafruit BRAINCRAFT machine learning products and projects](http://adafruit.com/machinelearning).
