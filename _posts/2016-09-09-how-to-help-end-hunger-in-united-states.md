Hunger is a real problem in the United States—while there's plenty of food to go around, there isn't a great system in place for distributing the food efficiently. To help end hunger in the US, it's a good idea to spread the message about how big the problem truly is. You can start raising money to donate to organizations, volunteering at local food banks, or writing to local lawmakers asking them to help with your mission of ending hunger.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Help-End-Hunger-in-the-United-States&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Supporting Programs and Organizations")\]Supporting Programs and Organizations

1.  Donate excess food in your home to an organization. If you have extra canned goods that aren’t being used or bought too much food the last time you went to the store, consider donating the leftovers. Do some research online to find an organization that’s right for your extra food.[\[7\]](#_note-7)
    
    [![Help End Hunger in the United States Step 7.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/ee/Help-End-Hunger-in-the-United-States-Step-7.jpg/aid10025057-v4-728px-Help-End-Hunger-in-the-United-States-Step-7.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Help-End-Hunger-in-the-United-States-Step-7.jpg)
    
    *   Use coupons when you go grocery shopping to purchase extra food specifically to donate.
    *   Packaged food can almost always be donated, and there are many food pantries or organizations (such as Ample Harvest) that will take fresh food.
2.  Contact your local food bank to learn about volunteer opportunities. Your local food bank or food pantry is always looking for people to help out, whether by organizing food, raising funds, or spreading awareness. Visit your local food bank in person, call their number, or visit their website to find out how you can get involved.[\[8\]](#_note-8)

    *   They’ll be able to tell you valuable information, such as which foods are best to donate as well as other places that need help collecting food.
    *   You can also check with your church or local non-profits to see if there are any events or opportunities to help raise money for food, start a food drive, or help end hunger in another way.
3.  [Host a healthy food drive](https://www.wikihow.com/Set-up-a-Food-Drive "Set up a Food Drive") in your area. Collect food from others that you can then donate to places such as a food pantry. Try to collect healthy foods instead of just junk food to provide a truly nutritious meal for someone.[\[9\]](#_note-9)
    
    [![Help End Hunger in the United States Step 9.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/96/Help-End-Hunger-in-the-United-States-Step-9.jpg/aid10025057-v4-728px-Help-End-Hunger-in-the-United-States-Step-9.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Help-End-Hunger-in-the-United-States-Step-9.jpg)
    
    *   Ask for foods such as peanut butter, canned tuna, canned fruit, whole wheat pasta, or low-sodium canned beans.
    *   Choose a place to have your food drive and put up flyers to advertise it.
    *   Post on social media to encourage others to donate to the food drive.
4.  Set up an online food drive to easily collect food. If you aren’t able to host a real food drive, you can start one online through You Give Goods. Click on “Start an Event” on the main page to set up your event, and make sure you pick a charity to donate the food to.

    *   You’ll be able to select a goal of how many food items you’d like to have donated, as well as how long you’d like the food drive to go on.
    *   Check out the online food drive website at [https://yougivegoods.com/](https://yougivegoods.com/).
5.  Help grow food locally. Not only is growing food locally a great way to know where the food is coming from, but it’s also sure to be fresh, which is something that malnourished or hungry people truly need. Start getting involved in community gardening projects, or start your own mini garden and donate some of the food to people in need.[\[11\]](#_note-11)
    
    [![Help End Hunger in the United States Step 11.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/86/Help-End-Hunger-in-the-United-States-Step-11.jpg/aid10025057-v4-728px-Help-End-Hunger-in-the-United-States-Step-11.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Help-End-Hunger-in-the-United-States-Step-11.jpg)
    
    *   Read your local paper, ask around, or look online to see if there are any community gardens in your area.
6.  Volunteer throughout the year, not just during winter holidays. A lot of people choose Thanksgiving or Christmas to volunteer at food pantries, homeless shelters, or church organizations. Try to volunteer year-round to help make a difference no matter the holiday.[\[12\]](#_note-12)
