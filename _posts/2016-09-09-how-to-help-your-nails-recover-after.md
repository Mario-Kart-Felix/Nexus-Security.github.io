Anyone who's ever had acrylic nails knows that they can absolutely ravage your natural nails if removed incorrectly. Typically, the best way to repair this damage is to wait for them to regrow. In the meantime, you can take steps to make sure your nails grow in happy and healthy by providing daily and weekly care and varying your diet to make sure you're getting the nutrients you need.

1.  Trim back weak nails to prevent breakage. If your nails feel weak after you take off the acrylics, it's likely they will break, which can be painful and result in jagged edges.[\[1\]](#_note-1) Cut your nails straight across with a pair of clean nail clippers. Round off the corners so they're not sharp.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

    *   You can also use manicure scissors to trim your nails.
2.  [File your nails](https://www.wikihow.com/File-Your-Nails "File Your Nails") in one direction only. Choose a fine-grit nail file, as it will be kinder to your nails. Start from one outside edge on your nail and move across the nail in that direction. Don't go back and forth, as that can ruin the edges of your nails.[\[3\]](#_note-3)  
      
    *   To keep from overdoing it, place the edge of the file under the tip of your nail so you can see what you're doing.
3.  [Buff your nails](https://www.wikihow.com/Buff-Your-Nails "Buff Your Nails") once a week. Remove oils from your nails first by rubbing acetone, rubbing alcohol, or vinegar over them. Use small, circular motions to buff the tops of your nails just until they're smooth. Don't go overboard, as you don't want to remove too much of the nail.[\[4\]](#_note-4)  
      
    *   You can also try buffing in an "X" shape.
    *   However, you don't want to do this too often, as it can remove some of your nails' thickness over time.[\[5\]](#_note-5)
4.  Keep your hands moisturized with hand creams. To create healthy nails, your hands need to be hydrated. Apply hand cream or lotion at least twice a day, including once before bedtime. Pick a heavy cream for night time for extra moisturizing power.[\[6\]](#_note-6)  
      
    *   Try putting on lotion after every time you wash your hands.
    *   Put on cotton gloves at night after applying lotion to help seal in the moisture.[\[7\]](#_note-7)
5.  Rub a cuticle oil with jojoba oil in it around your nails. Keeping your cuticles moisturized will support your nails and help them stay moisturized and healthy, too. Apply cuticle oil around your nails at least once a day. At night is best so that you can leave it on while you sleep.[\[8\]](#_note-8)  
      
    *   Put it on after you apply your lotion or hand cream.
6.  Try a nail hardener to protect your nails. If your nails are weak and brittle, a nail hardener may provide enough support to allow them to grow back properly. Simply paint on a coating of nail hardener like you would nail polish, moving from the nail bed up to the tip of the nail. Allow the hardener to dry and re-apply as needed.[\[9\]](#_note-9)  
      
    *   You can find nail hardeners at most drugstores and big box stores. They may also be labeled as "nail strengtheners."
    *   Some people find nail hardeners work a little too well, making nails more likely to break. If that's the case for you, try just wearing a clear base coat of nail polish instead.[\[10\]](#_note-10)
7.  Wait for your nails to grow back in. While you can't completely heal the damage down by acrylics, your nails will eventually regrow. They will typically come back in strong and healthy as long as you are paying attention to nail care and eating a healthy, well-balanced diet.[\[11\]](#_note-11)

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Eating the Right Nutrients")\]Eating the Right Nutrients

1.  Get biotin in your diet from things like eggs, meat, and avocados. Biotin is important for healthy nails, skin, and hair, and it may improve the health of your nails after they've been damaged by acrylics. Most meats are a good source of biotin, including fish. You can also eat nuts, sweet potatoes, spinach, and broccoli to get enough biotin.[\[12\]](#_note-12)
    
    [![Help Your Nails Recover After Acrylics Step 12.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4a/Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics-Step-12.jpg/aid316909-v4-728px-Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics-Step-12.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics-Step-12.jpg)
    
    *   If you're over 18, aim for 30 micrograms of biotin a day. A single egg contains 10 micrograms of biotin, while a pork chop or hamburger patty has 3.8 micrograms and of salmon has 5 micrograms.
    *   With nuts and seeds, of sunflower seeds has 2.6 micrograms while the same amount of almonds has 1.5 micrograms.
    *   If you feel like you're not getting enough biotin in your diet, ask your doctor if a supplement is a good idea for you.[\[13\]](#_note-13) Typically, a 2.5-milligram supplement is helpful.[\[14\]](#_note-14) While this is much higher than the daily recommended amount, you can consume as much as 50 milligrams a day without problems.
2.  Take a daily 10-milligram silicon supplement. Silicon can help repair your nails if they've become brittle after wearing acrylics. Look for one with choline-stabilized orthosilicic acid (ch-OSA) and take it daily for at least 4 months.[\[15\]](#_note-15)
    
    [![Help Your Nails Recover After Acrylics Step 13.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/79/Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics-Step-13.jpg/aid316909-v4-728px-Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics-Step-13.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics-Step-13.jpg)
    
    *   Talk to your doctor before starting any supplement.
    *   If you don't want to take a supplement, beer is one of the best natural sources of silicon. A single beer has 10 milligrams of silicon, so you can also get this nutrient that way. Always consume drinks in moderation, though.[\[16\]](#_note-16)
3.  Ensure you're getting enough protein in your diet.[\[17\]](#_note-17) To determine how much protein you need in a day, multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36 grams or your weight in kilograms by 0.8 grams. You can also use an online protein calculator.[\[18\]](#_note-18)
    
    [![Help Your Nails Recover After Acrylics Step 14.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/58/Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics-Step-14.jpg/aid316909-v4-728px-Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics-Step-14.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics-Step-14.jpg)
    
    *   For instance, if you weigh 150 pounds, multiply that by 0.36 grams to get 54 grams of protein. If you weigh 90 kilograms, multiply that by 0.8 grams to get 72 grams of protein.
    *   As a guide, a serving of tuna, salmon, or haddock the size of a deck of cards has 21 grams of protein while the same serving of turkey or chicken has 19 grams.
    *   A single egg has 6 grams of protein, while 0.5 cups (81 grams) of cottage cheese has 14 grams and the same serving of cooked beans has 8 grams.
4.  Eat iron-rich foods such as red meat, leafy greens, and beans. An iron deficiency can lead to problems with your nails and hair, so make sure you are getting enough in your diet. Women who are 19-50 need 18 milligrams of iron a day, while all other adults need 8 milligrams.[\[19\]](#_note-19)
    
    [![Help Your Nails Recover After Acrylics Step 15.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/13/Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics-Step-15.jpg/aid316909-v4-728px-Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics-Step-15.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics-Step-15.jpg)
    
    *   Fortified breakfast cereals are one of the best sources of iron, as they contain 18 milligrams per serving. A serving of oysters or 1 cup (179 grams) of white beans both contain 8 milligrams of iron. Other good sources include dark chocolate, spinach, lentils, meat, and beans.
    *   Talk to your doctor if you think you may have an iron deficiency, typically classified by fatigue, cold extremities, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, weakness, and brittle nails.[\[20\]](#_note-20)
5.  Eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, seeds, and nuts. Many vitamins and minerals support good nail health, so aim for a variety of foods in your diet. Eat a wide spectrum of fruits and vegetables, as well as whole grains like whole wheat, quinoa, brown rice, bulgur, and buckwheat.[\[21\]](#_note-21)

    *   Aim for a variety of beans, seeds, and nuts as well!

1.  Ask a professional to [remove your acrylics](https://www.wikihow.com/Remove-Acrylic-Nails "Remove Acrylic Nails"). Because acrylics require filing off, it's best down by a professional. They will cut off the tips, then mostly file the acrylic off of your nails. After that, they will soak your nails in acetone to completely remove the polish.[\[22\]](#_note-22)
    
    [![Help Your Nails Recover After Acrylics Step 8 Version 4.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/46/Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics-Step-8-Version-4.jpg/aid316909-v4-728px-Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics-Step-8-Version-4.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics-Step-8-Version-4.jpg)
    
    *   Usually, they'll use a cuticle pusher to completely remove the acrylic at the end.
2.  Take breaks between acrylics. If you use acrylics continuously, your nails will likely suffer. Go at least a week before applying your next set of acrylics to give your nails time to strengthen again.[\[23\]](#_note-23)
    
    [![Help Your Nails Recover After Acrylics Step 9 Version 4.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9b/Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics-Step-9-Version-4.jpg/aid316909-v4-728px-Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics-Step-9-Version-4.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics-Step-9-Version-4.jpg)
    
    *   Alternatively, use fake nails on special occasions only.[\[24\]](#_note-24)
3.  Opt for gels over acrylics to be kinder to your nails. If your nails have suffered from acrylics, switch to gels for a while. Some gels can be completely soaked off instead of filed down, making them less harsh on your nails.[\[25\]](#_note-25)
    
    [![Help Your Nails Recover After Acrylics Step 10 Version 4.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/97/Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics-Step-10-Version-4.jpg/aid316909-v4-728px-Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics-Step-10-Version-4.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics-Step-10-Version-4.jpg)
    
    *   Also, gels bend more easily then acrylics, meaning they're less likely to crack your nails.
4.  Replace acrylics completely every 6 to 12 months. If you do leave your acrylics on, you should completely replace them at least once a year. That's because air pockets under acrylics can cause them to lift off, creating more damage to your nails.[\[26\]](#_note-26)
    
    [![Help Your Nails Recover After Acrylics Step 11.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/87/Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics-Step-11.jpg/aid316909-v4-728px-Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics-Step-11.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Help-Your-Nails-Recover-After-Acrylics-Step-11.jpg)
    
    *   Plus, removing them completely gives you a chance to provide extra care for your nails.
