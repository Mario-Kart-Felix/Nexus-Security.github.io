As [iTunes is shut down](https://beebom.com/best-itunes-alternatives/) with the introduction of [macOS Catalina](https://beebom.com/macos-catalina-features/), Apple Music has become part of the newly launched Music app. From what I have experienced, the music-streaming service looks more intuitive for users than ever before. The clean interface feels inviting and is much easier to navigate. Well, that is the perspective of an Apple Music subscriber. What about the ones who haven’t subscribed to the service? Would they still have to bear with the unnecessary Apple Music sections like _For You, Browse, and Radio_? Turns out, there is a way to hide Apple Music in the stock music app on macOS Catalina. Here is how this hidden trick works!  

Hide Apple Music from the Stock Music App on Mac
------------------------------------------------

  

### What Happens When You Remove Apple Music on macOS Catalina?

  

I know now you must be wondering what happens when you put Apple Music out of sight and whether or not it will impact your user experience. _When you remove the music-service from the app, its sections like For You, Browse, and Radio get hidden._ However, your library navigation and playlists remain in the sidebar. Moreover, you can continue to access all of your Apple Music tracks, albums, created/subscribed playlists without any issues. Long story short, it won’t impact your user-experience at all.  

1.  Launch **Music** app on your Mac.

2\. Now, click on the **Music** menu in the top left corner of the screen and choose **Preferences.**

3\. Next, click on the **Restrictions** tab.

5\. Finally, click **OK** to finish.

That’s it! The For You, Radio, and Browse tabs will no longer show up in the sidebar. Of course, if you ever want them back, head into the Music Preferences following the same steps and then uncheck the box for Apple Music in the Disable section. In the end, be sure to click on **OK** to finish.  

Show the iTunes Store in the Music App in macOS Catalina
--------------------------------------------------------

  

By default, the Music app keeps iTunes Store hidden. However, you can choose to show it as per your needs.  

1\. Launch the **Music** app on your macOS device.

2\. Now, click on the **Music menu** and choose **Preferences** in the menu.  

![Next, click on the Music menu and select Preferences option in the menu](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Next-click-on-the-Music-menu-and-select-Preferences-option-in-the-menu.jpg)

3\. In the **General** section, check the box for the **iTunes Store. **

4\. In the end, make sure to click on **OK** to finish.  

![Finally, click on OK in the end](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Finally-click-on-OK-in-the-end.jpg)

That’s pretty much it! From now onwards, the **iTunes Store** will begin to show up in the sidebar of the **Music** app.

Keep Apple Music Out of Sight on Mac…

Apple Music may have triumphed over Spotify to become  one of the [most loved music-streaming apps](https://beebom.com/iphone-music-streaming-apps/) in the US. However, it’s not yet perfect and also far behind the latter globally. Therefore, it may not appeal to everyone’s taste. Thankfully, Apple has offered a way to keep it out of sight.
