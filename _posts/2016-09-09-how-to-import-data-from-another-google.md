Should you need to import data from another spreadsheet in [Google Sheets](https://www.howtogeek.com/425040/the-beginners-guide-to-google-sheets/), you can do it a couple of ways. Whether you want to pull the data from another sheet in the file or an entirely different spreadsheet, here’s how.

Import Data from Another Sheet
------------------------------

This first method requires you to have more than one sheet inside of a document. You can see whether your document has more than one sheet by looking at the bottom of the page. And to add another one, just hit the plus sign (+) to create a new one.

Fire up your browser, head to [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/), and open up a spreadsheet. Click and highlight the cell where you want to import the data.

Next, you need to type in a formula that references the cell from the other sheet. If your sheets are named, you will want to put its name in place of and the cell you want to reference after the exclamation mark. It should look something like this:

```
\=!B7
```
