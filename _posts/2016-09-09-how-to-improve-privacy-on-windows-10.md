Of late, Microsoft has been very aggressive about its push to replace the local account on Windows 10 with an online account. In fact, [recent reports](https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-10/222344/microsoft-made-major-setup-changes-in-windows-10-version-1909#) suggest that the local account option is no longer available on the Windows 10 setup screen. All this points to one thing that Microsoft needs more user data and there can’t be a better product than Windows 10 to monetize it. The data can help the company to push tailored ads bringing extra revenue while also getting an insight into consumer behavior. However, if you are a [privacy-conscious user](https://beebom.com/best-ways-keep-privacy-android/), this is a serious red flag that can undermine your privacy without any explicit consent. So, in this article, we bring you a simple guide to improve privacy on Windows 10. We have also mentioned a one-stop tool to manage privacy settings on Windows 10 seamlessly. With all that said, let’s go through the guide.  

Improve Windows 10 Privacy
--------------------------

  

You can improve your privacy on [Windows 10](https://beebom.com/best-new-windows-10-features/) natively and Microsoft does provide a lot of controls over your user data. However, those **privacy settings are stuffed under various pages** and few are kept away from users’ reach. Nevertheless, here we will learn how to, at least, access the basic privacy settings and turn them off so that no unfunny business happens in the background.  

### 1\. Block Diagnostic Data

  

Windows 10 has something called diagnostic telemetry which aims to track your usage, background services, unexpected crashes, and common errors. It helps Microsoft to patch the OS and bring a better [Windows experience](https://beebom.com/windows-10-tips-and-tricks/) to the user. However, **Microsoft also uses these data to serve you tailored ads and product recommendations**. For me, this is off-putting so I always disable these kinds of background telemetry services. You can also do so, just search for “privacy” in the search bar and open the first result. Here, under the “Diagnostics and Feedback” tab, disable all the toggles.

### 2\. Disable Activity History

  

[Activity History](https://beebom.com/set-up-activity-syncing-windows/) is another important privacy setting that you should completely turn off. **It tracks your app usage including the websites you are browsing on the internet**. That’s completely insane, right? I assume this happens only if you are using Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer. But still, this privacy setting should not be turned on by default. Anyway, you can manually turn it off from the same Privacy page under the “Activity History” tab.

Having said that, [Redditors](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/a4lpg0/windows_10_still_collecting_activity_history/) have discovered that **Microsoft still tracks your usage even after you have completely disabled Activity History** on your PC. This kind of behavior by Microsoft does not bode well for privacy-conscious users. If you want to truly disable all kinds of background telemetry then you will have to modify the Group policy and Registry settings which seems out of the way for any general user. So to safeguard privacy on Windows 10, we recommend a special privacy tool that does all the job for you in a seamless and effective manner.
