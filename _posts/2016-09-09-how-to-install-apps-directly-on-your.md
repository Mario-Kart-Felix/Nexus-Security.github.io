With watchOS 6, the Apple Watch is inching ever closer to being a standalone device. While you still can’t set up an Apple Watch without an iPhone, you can now install and delete apps without touching your smartphone.

How to Install Apps on Apple Watch
----------------------------------

When you open the Watch app on your iPhone and go to the App Store tab, you’ll find that it’s empty. The App Store has now moved to your wrist in the watchOS 6 update.

To install apps on your Apple Watch, press the Digital Crown to open the Apps screen. Here, locate the new “App Store” icon and tap on it.

You’ll see that the entire Apple Watch app store is here on your wrist, listing all the watchOS specific apps.

The App Store’s landing page includes a search bar at the top and a curated list of apps below. You can scroll through the whole screen and find interesting apps that you want to install.

If you’re looking for something specific, tap on the “Search” bar located at the top. You’ll see two ways to search for an app. Tap on “Scribble” to write words on the Watch’s screen with your finger. You can also tap on the “Dictation” feature to [use Siri dictation](https://www.howtogeek.com/233913/15-things-you-can-do-with-siri-on-the-apple-watch/) to look for apps.
