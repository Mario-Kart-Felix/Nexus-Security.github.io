Many were apprehensive about Redmi Note 8 Pro’s GCam support as this time [Xiaomi went with a Mediatek processor](https://beebom.com/redmi-note-8-pro-launched-price-specs-features/). However, all doubts have been laid to rest as a developer named wyroczen has modded a fully stable GCam for Redmi Note 8 Pro. It works absolutely great and without any crash or buffer issues. So, in this article, we bring you the stable Google Camera APK for Redmi Note 8 Pro along with a step-by-step installation guide. So without further ado, let’s get started.  

Install GCam on Redmi Note 8 Pro
--------------------------------

  

1\. Thanks to wyroczen’s effort, now we can use Google Camera on Redmi Note 8 Pro without a hitch. To **download the GCam APK**, click on this [link](https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/f/changelog804/). Also, **download the XML config file** from [here](https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/p/f/2019/11/wyroczen_rn8pro_3.xml). We will need both these files.  

2\. Now, go ahead and install the APK. In case Android blocks the installation, tap on “Settings” and **enable the toggle** for unknown sources.

3\. After the installation, open the file manager and locate the XML file. Now, **move the XML file and paste it into the gcam -> configs** folder on your internal storage.  

_**Note:** If you are unable to find the gcam folder, create one and rename it as “gcam” and then create a configs folder inside._

4\. Now, open Google Camera and **double-tap anywhere on the black bar** around the shutter button. A dialog box will appear. Here, select the XML config file that you just moved into the internal storage from the drop-down menu. It should read “wyroczen\_rn8pro\_3.xml”. Finally, tap on the “Restore” button.
