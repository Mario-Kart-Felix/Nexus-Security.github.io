In line with [recent leaks](https://beebom.com/google-pixel-4-release-date-specs-price-leaks-news/), Pixel 4 is coming with a native voice recorder app and a built-in screen recorder. While the screen recorder will be available as a system feature on Pixel 4, the voice recorder app is available right now and it works on any Android device. The good part about having a first-party voice recorder is that you no longer have to rely on shady voice recorder apps from the Play Store. With that said, here is how you can install Pixel 4 voice recorder app on any Android device.

Before we begin, keep in mind, the Pixel 4 recorder app **works with Android Pie and above**. Also, on Android 10, it’s using [scoped storage](https://beebom.com/android-q-features/) to better protect your recording from third-party apps having storage permission. Having said that, here are the steps to follow.  

1\. APKMirror has already hosted the upcoming Recorder app from Pixel 4. Just **grab the APK from this [link](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/google-recorder/recorder-5-0-5-257343194-release/recorder-0-5-257343194-android-apk-download/)** and install it on your Android device.
