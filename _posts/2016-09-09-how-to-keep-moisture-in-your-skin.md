Keeping your skin moist and supple throughout the day can be challenging, especially in dry winter air. The key to getting beautifully hydrated skin that lasts all day is timing and layering your moisturizer correctly. Always apply moisturizers to damp skin and layer lighter treatments like oils and serums underneath your moisturizer. Weekly treatments like exfoliation and face masks can help get rid of dead skin and give you an extra glow.

1.  Use lukewarm water to wash up. Using hot water to shower or wash your face might feel nice, but it can dry out your skin, too. Hot water strips away the skin's natural oils and will leave it more dry, no matter how much moisturizer you apply.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   If you can't give up hot showers, try to switch to using lukewarm water for washing your face and hands.
2.  Look for alcohol- and soap-free cleansers. Deodorant soaps, scents, and alcohol all have drying effects on the skin. Look for ingredients like glycerine, Niacinimide, and Vitamin B3, especially if you have sensitive skin.[\[2\]](#_note-2)
    
    [![Keep Moisture in Your Skin Step 2.jpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b0/Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-2.jpeg/aid11435700-v4-728px-Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-2.jpeg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-2.jpeg)
    
    *   Foaming and scrubbing cleansers can also dry out the skin.
3.  Use oils, serums, or medications before applying moisturizer. In order for your moisturizer to work the best, it should be the last thing you apply to your skin. If you use any oils, serums, or medications, such as acne creams, apply them directly after cleansing your skin.[\[3\]](#_note-3)
    
    [![Keep Moisture in Your Skin Step 3.jpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/ed/Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-3.jpeg/aid11435700-v4-728px-Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-3.jpeg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-3.jpeg)
    
    *   Apply products to your skin in order from the product with the lightest formula to the heaviest formula.
4.  [Apply moisturizer](https://www.wikihow.com/Apply-Moisturizer "Apply Moisturizer") while your skin is still damp. Use an oil-based ointment or cream rather than a water-based lotion. Olive oil, jojoba oil, and shea butter are all natural ingredients that soothe and moisturize dry skin. Moisturizer of any kind won't work unless your skin is already a little wet. Apply moisturizer after gently patting your body, face, or hands dry, while your skin still feels damp.[\[4\]](#_note-4)
    
    [![Keep Moisture in Your Skin Step 4.jpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/14/Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-4.jpeg/aid11435700-v4-728px-Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-4.jpeg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-4.jpeg)
    
    *   The best kind of moisturizer is a cream that contains hyaluronic acid or ceramides. The thicker and greasier the formula feels, the more effectively it will seal in moisture.
    *   Apply a hand cream after you wash your hands.
5.  Massage products gently into the skin. Rubbing your skin too hard or too much can cause irritation. Rub the tips of your fingers in small circles to gently massage any products you are using into your skin.[\[5\]](#_note-5)
    
    [![Keep Moisture in Your Skin Step 5.jpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/29/Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-5.jpeg/aid11435700-v4-728px-Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-5.jpeg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-5.jpeg)
    
    *   To minimize irritation even more, use a patting motion rather than a rubbing motion to dry your face and body.
6.  Exfoliate once a week to get rid of dead skin and help moisturizers penetrate. Although exfoliating doesn't actively moisturize, it can help the skin get rid of dead cells so that moisturizers work better. Exfoliate your hands, face, and all over your body, then follow the treatment immediately with a moisturizer. Use a gentle, unscented exfoliator, especially for the face.[\[6\]](#_note-6)
    
    [![Keep Moisture in Your Skin Step 6.jpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/ae/Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-6.jpeg/aid11435700-v4-728px-Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-6.jpeg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-6.jpeg)
    
    *   If you have sensitive skin, a washcloth and a gentle chemical exfoliator should be enough, rather than an exfoliator with beads.
    *   Excessively exfoliating can leave your skin raw and won't help lock moisturizer in any better.
7.  Try a face mask once or twice a week. Look for a cream, gel, or sheet mask with ingredients like collagen and antioxidants. Choose a face mask created for your skin type or problem (for example, oily skin or redness). Pay attention to instructions on the packaging that will tell you how long you need to leave the face mask in place and how you should remove it. Apply a moisturizer after you take the face mask off.[\[7\]](#_note-7)

    *   Always use face masks on clean and exfoliated skin.
    *   You can also [make a homemade face mask](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Homemade-Face-Mask-for-Dry-Skin "Make a Homemade Face Mask for Dry Skin") using 1 avocado, 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of plain yogurt, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of olive oil, and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of organic honey to the bowl. Leave the mask on for 15-20 minutes and rinse it with warm water.

1.  Avoid taking baths or hot showers. Soaking in a hot tub can be tempting when it's cold outside, but it will certainly dry out your skin, as will a long, hot shower. Lukewarm water is best for keeping your skin as moisturized as possible.[\[8\]](#_note-8)
    
    [![Keep Moisture in Your Skin Step 9.jpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/ee/Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-9.jpeg/aid11435700-v4-728px-Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-9.jpeg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-9.jpeg)
    
    *   If you love taking baths, try making them a special once a week event and limit how long you spend in the water.
2.  Add a layer between your skin and wool to avoid irritation. If you bundle up in wool clothes to keep warm, you might notice that your skin becomes itchy and irritated where it rubs up against the fabric. Try layering a more skin-friendly fabric, like cotton or silk, between your self and your wool sweater to keep warm without irritating your skin.[\[9\]](#_note-9)
    
    [![Keep Moisture in Your Skin Step 10.jpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/61/Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-10.jpeg/aid11435700-v4-728px-Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-10.jpeg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-10.jpeg)
    
    *   Also wash your clothes using unscented or hypoallergenic detergent to reduce irritation on your skin.
    *   Other fabrics that can irritate your skin include bamboo, acrylic, polyester, rayon, acetate, and nylon.[\[10\]](#_note-10)
3.  Keep yourself hydrated. It's important to keep hydrated year-round, but it can be harder in the winter. Adults need around 11.5 cups (2.7 liters)-15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of water every day. As a rule of thumb, if you feel thirsty, you are probably dehydrated. If you're having trouble drinking enough water to stay hydrated, try eating foods that have a high water content such as cucumbers, tomatoes, zucchini, carrots, and kiwi.[\[11\]](#_note-11)
    
    [![Keep Moisture in Your Skin Step 11.jpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/fa/Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-11.jpeg/aid11435700-v4-728px-Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-11.jpeg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-11.jpeg)
    
    *   A lot of these foods also contain vitamin C, which can help your skin produce elastin and collagen.
4.  Wear [sunscreen](https://www.wikihow.com/Apply-Sunscreen "Apply Sunscreen"), even on the darkest, cloudiest days. Even if it seems like the sun is a distant memory, it's important to wear sunscreen every day. Low levels of sun exposure can contribute to skin damage over time, leading to wrinkles, spots, or even skin cancer.[\[12\]](#_note-12)
    
    [![Keep Moisture in Your Skin Step 12.jpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/ae/Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-12.jpeg/aid11435700-v4-728px-Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-12.jpeg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-12.jpeg)
    
    *   If you live in a place with high winds or extremely cold temperatures, also take care to protect your face from the elements by layering up with scarves, hats, and gloves.
5.  Use a humidifier in your room during winter. Winter brings dry air, both indoors and outdoors, which can dry out your skin. Keep the humidity in your room at around 60% to keep your skin hydrated at night.[\[13\]](#_note-13)
    
    [![Keep Moisture in Your Skin Step 8.jpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f8/Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-8.jpeg/aid11435700-v4-728px-Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-8.jpeg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Keep-Moisture-in-Your-Skin-Step-8.jpeg)
    
    *   Your skin repairs itself a lot while you are sleeping, so your bedroom is the best place for a humidifier.

*   See a dermatologist if you have consistently dry, irritated skin that doesn't get better.
*   Don't scratch your skin. If you have an itch, try applying moisturizer or putting a barrier between your skin and an irritant.
*   Always test new skincare products on a small swatch of skin first to check for an allergic reaction.[\[14\]](#_note-14)
