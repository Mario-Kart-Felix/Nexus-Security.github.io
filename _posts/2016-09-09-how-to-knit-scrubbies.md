Scrubbies are small abrasive dishcloths that you can use to clean hard surfaces and dishes. You can knit your own scrubbies using a special type of scrubby yarn or a combination of dishcloth yarn and nylon netting. This is an easy, quick, and useful project for knitters of all levels, so make some scrubbies for yourself and your friends!

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Knit-Scrubbies&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Designing Your Scrubbies")\]Designing Your Scrubbies

1.  Choose a textured scrubby and/or cotton yarn. A textured scrubby yarn is ideal for making scrubbies, but you can also use a cotton yarn. Try checking online or in your local craft supply store for a textured scrubby yarn. If none is available, then opt for a cotton yarn.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   Red Heart has a yarn called Scrubby that is specifically for making scrubbies.
    *   Sugar n’ Cream is a popular type of cotton yarn, but you may use any brand you like.
2.  Get a pair of knitting needles that will work with your yarn. Check the yarn label to determine what type of knitting needles will work best for the yarn you are using. This will help to ensure that you get the best possible results.

    *   For example, a pair of US size 7 to 9 (4.5 to 5.5 mm) knitting needles will work well if you are using a medium-weight scrubby yarn.[\[2\]](#_note-2)
3.  Add nylon for extra scrubbing power if desired. If you want extra texture in your scrubbies or if your yarn is not textured, then you can incorporate some nylon into your knitting. Purchase some nylon net and cut it into strands. Then, tie those strands together to make nylon yarn that you can knit into your scrubby.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

    *   Check your local craft supply store for nylon net or buy some online.

1.  Hold 2 strands together for a thicker scrubby. If you want a thick durable scrubby, then knit with 2 strands of scrubby yarn at once. Another option is to hold 1 piece of scrubby or nylon yarn and 1 piece of cotton yarn as you knit. However, you may also knit with 1 strand of scrubby or nylon yarn to make your scrubby.
    
    [![Knit Scrubbies Step 4.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/50/Knit-Scrubbies-Step-4.jpg/aid10178063-v4-728px-Knit-Scrubbies-Step-4.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Knit-Scrubbies-Step-4.jpg)
    
    *   If you are working with a single ball of scrubby yarn, then divide the ball into 2 equal-sized balls before you get started.
    *   If you are using nylon to add texture to the scrubby, the hold 1 strand of nylon yarn with 1 strand of cotton yarn to knit the scrubby.
2.  [Make a slipknot](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Slip-Knot "Make a Slip Knot"). Loop the yarn around your index and ring finger twice, and pinch the intersection of 2 loops (where the loops begin and end). Slip the loops off your fingers while pinching this section, and then bring the second loop over the first loop. Tug on the tail-end of the yarn to tighten the loop slightly. Slide the loop onto your right-hand needle and tug on the tail to tighten it further.[\[4\]](#_note-4)  
      
    *   This slipknot counts as your first cast on stitch.
3.  [Cast on](https://www.wikihow.com/Cast-On "Cast On") 15 stitches. Loop the yarn over the left-hand needle and insert the right-hand needle into the loop. Yarn over the right-hand needle and pull through to create your second cast on stitch. Keep casting on until you have a total of 15 stitches.[\[5\]](#_note-5)  
      
    *   If desired, you may cast on more or fewer stitches than 15 to create a different size scrubby.
4.  [Knit](https://www.wikihow.com/Knit "Knit") across the first row. To knit, insert the right-hand needle through the first stitch on the left-hand needle going from front to back. Then, loop the yarn over the end of the right-hand needle and pull this new loop through the old loop, and then let the old loop slide off the end of the left-hand needle.[\[6\]](#_note-6)  
      
    *   Repeat this sequence all the way to the end of the row.
5.  Turn your work and continue knitting. Switch the right-hand needle with all of the stitches on it to your left hand, and place the empty needle in your right hand. Then, continue knitting across this new row. By turning your work after each row, you will be working in the garter stitch. This stitch has a little stretch and texture to it.[\[7\]](#_note-7)  
      
    
6.  Continue to knit until the scrubby is the desired size. After you finish casting on, knit across the first row and then continue knitting all of the rows until the scrubby is the desired size. A good scrubby size is about , which is roughly 22 rows.[\[8\]](#_note-8)  
      
    *   You can measure your scrubby when it looks like it is close to the desired size, but you can also just guess. Scrubbies do not need to be perfect since you will just be using them to scrub counters and dishes.
7.  [Bind off](https://www.wikihow.com/Cast-Off "Cast Off") the last row. To finish your scrubby, you will need to bind off the stitches. Start by knitting the first 2 stitches in the row. Then, use the left-hand needle to lift the first stitch on the right-hand needle over the second stitch. Then, knit 1 and use the left-hand needle to lift the first 1 up and over the second 1 again.[\[9\]](#_note-9)  
      
    *   Keep doing this to the end of the row to bind off all the stitches.
    *   After binding off the last stitch, tie a knot through it and cut the excess yarn.
