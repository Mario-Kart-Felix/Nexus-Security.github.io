Especially when searching for a specific file or folder, I want the search to be as precise as possible. The search bar in every [Finder](https://beebom.com/cool-finder-tricks-for-mac/) window is set to search an entire system, which seems a bit odd – to say the least. However, slightly hidden within Finder preferences is an option to limit the search to a current folder on macOS. If you haven’t yet discovered this [little known Mac feature](https://beebom.com/cool-mac-tricks/), now is the right time to unravel it. Here is how you can limit Finder search to current folder on Mac.  

Restrict Finder Search to Current Folder on macOS
-------------------------------------------------

  

Wondering whether or not your Mac will allow you to customize the Finder search bar? Well, this feature has existed on macOS/OS X for ages. So, even if your Mac is running the old macOS versions, you can restrict the search inside the stock file manager. The good thing is it doesn’t change [Spotlight](https://beebom.com/spotlight-tips-tricks/) preferences, therefore your system-wide search-setting won’t be impacted. With that said, let’s get started!  

1.  Launch the **Finder** app on your Mac.

2\. Now, click on the **Finder** menu at the top left corner and choose **Preferences. **

3\. Next, click on the **Advanced** tab.

4\. Under **“When performing a search”** section, click on the **drop-down menu.**

5\. Finally, choose the **“Search the Current Folder”** option.

There you go! From now onwards, the file manager will be restricted to look only inside a current folder rather than tracking down the entire system.  

Customize Finder Search on Mac
------------------------------

  

So, that’s how you can fine-tune the Finder search on your macOS device to look only inside a current directory. Times when you are tracking down a specific file, it comes in super handy in narrowing down the hunt. Therefore, it saves not only time but also [enhances productivity](https://beebom.com/essential-mac-apps/). What’s your take on this hack and where does Apple’s file manager [stand against popular rivals](https://beebom.com/finder-alternatives-mac/)?
