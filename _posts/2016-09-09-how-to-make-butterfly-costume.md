### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Make-a-Butterfly-Costume&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Creating Butterfly Wings")\]Creating Butterfly Wings

1.  Draw or print a butterfly wing template. You can draw a template onto a large piece of butcher paper or newspaper if you want to make your own. Use a picture of a butterfly to help you choose a wing design and copy it as best you can. Or, find a free butterfly wing pattern online and print it out. Cut out your paper template using a sharp pair of scissors.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   If you are making your own template, measure yourself from fingertip to fingertip and divide this number in half to determine how wide to make the wing template. Then, measure from your shoulder to the middle of your thigh to determine how long to make the template.
    *   You only need to draw or print 1 wing to use as your template.[\[2\]](#_note-2)
2.  Pin the wing template onto a long piece of fabric. Muslin, cotton, felt are all good choices for making butterfly wings. Fold your fabric so that it is in 2 layers and smooth out any lumps or bumps. Place the template onto the fabric so that the inner or flat edge of the wing template is lined up with the fold. Place a pin every along the edges.[\[3\]](#_note-3)  
      
    *   Insert the pins so that they are perpendicular to the edges of the template.
3.  Cut around the non-folded edges of the wing template. Do not cut along the folded edge! Only cut along the curves and other parts of the wings. Use a sharp pair of fabric scissors to make long, even cuts in the fabric. Be careful not to create any jagged edges as you cut.[\[4\]](#_note-4)  
      
    *   Remove the pins and the paper template after you finish cutting and open up the wings. Place them with the right (outer or print) side of the fabric facing up. If the fabric is the same on both sides, then this won’t matter.
4.  Use markers or paint if you want to color the wings yourself. If you are using a light –colored muslin or cotton fabric, then you can color it in with fabric markers or acrylic paint. Use the shapes that are printed on your template to help you determine where to draw shapes and fill them in with color.[\[5\]](#_note-5)  
      
    *   Try using black, orange, and white for a monarch butterfly look.
    *   Go with different shades of 1 color, such as dark blue, royal blue, and light blue for a monochromatic butterfly look.
    *   Choose several bright or pastel colors for a rainbow effect.
5.  Cut out shapes and glue them on if you want a 3D effect. If the template you used includes various shapes, then you can use these to cut out fabric pieces that you can glue onto your wings. If the wing template does not include shapes, you can draw your own using an image of butterfly wings as your guide. Cut out teardrops and dots and attach them to the wing with fabric glue. Position the teardrops on the middle of the wings with the pointed ends facing in and place the dots along the outer edges.[\[6\]](#_note-6)  
      
    *   Butterflies usually have intricate patterns on their wings, but don’t worry if you can’t replicate it exactly. Gluing a variety of shapes to the wing will create the desired effect.
6.  Add accents with puffy paint, glitter, or other items. After you have colored in the wings with your desired colors, add more detail by enhancing the design with colorful shapes, glitter, sequins, pom poms, or beads. Use fabric glue to attach items to the wings where you want them to go.[\[7\]](#_note-7)  
      
    *   Let the glue dry for 8 hours or overnight before you move or wear the wings.
7.  Tie elastic bands to the wings to keep them on your wrists. Cut a small slit in the wing and insert a long scrap of fabric through it. Loop an elastic band on the fabric and tie a double knot to secure the elastic band to the wing. Then, trim off the excess fabric leaving only about . Repeat for the other side.[\[8\]](#_note-8)  
      
    *   Slip the elastic bands over your wrists when you wear the wings. This will allow you to flap and flutter the wings while you wear them.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Make-a-Butterfly-Costume&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Putting the Costume Together")\]Putting the Costume Together

1.  Use double-sided tape to attach the wings to a shirt or dress. After you have finished decorating your wings and the paint or glue has dried, place a piece of double-sided tape along the center of the wings. Then, press the back of a dress, shirt, or sweatshirt onto the double sided tape to attach the wings to it.[\[9\]](#_note-9) You may also want to tack the wings down at the top of the garment with needle and thread, or secure it with a couple of safety pins to ensure that the wings will stay put.[\[10\]](#_note-10)  
      
    *   Make sure to select a dress or shirt and pants that will complement the colors in your wings. For example, if your wings are orange, black, and white, then go with a black dress or a black t-shirt with black leggings.
2.  Make a simple antennae headband to wear. Glue 1 pom pom to the end of a pipe cleaner. Repeat with another pom pom and pipe cleaner. Let the glue dry overnight. Wrap the free end of the pipe cleaner around the center of a headband. Repeat this with the second pipe cleaner and pom pom. Adjust the antennae to your liking, such as by separating the pom poms or bending the pipe cleaners slightly.[\[11\]](#_note-11)  
      
    *   Wear the antennae headband with your butterfly wings to complete the costume.
3.  Style your hair to complement the butterfly wings. You might also style your hair in a way that will complement the costume. You could wear your hair back [in a bun](https://www.wikihow.com/Do-a-Quick-and-Easy-Hair-Bun "Do a Quick and Easy Hair Bun") for a sleek look, or wear your hair loose for something more casual.

    *   If you decide to add hair clips or other accessories, choose ones that match your costume, such as yellow clips with yellow butterfly wings.
4.  Do butterfly inspired makeup or [face paint](https://www.wikihow.com/Face-Paint-a-Butterfly "Face Paint a Butterfly"). Choose eye shadow and lipstick colors that match your wings, or draw a butterfly on your cheek using face paint. For example, if you are wearing royal blue, black, and white butterfly wings, then opt for a blue lipstick with blue or white eyeshadow and black eyeliner.[\[12\]](#_note-12)  
      
    *   Keep in mind that wearing makeup is optional.
