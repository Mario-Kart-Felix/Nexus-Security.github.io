Chai lattes are a delicious take on traditional chai tea. Similar to a latte made with espresso, the chai latte combines frothy milk with a concentrated brew of spiced tea. Making your own chai at home is easier than you might think, and it allows you to customize the spices and toppings to your liking. Chai lattes are perfect for cold winter days or as a delicious after-dinner treat.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Make-Chai-Latte&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Toasting the Spices and Brewing the Tea")\]Toasting the Spices and Brewing the Tea

1.  Combine all the spices in a small saucepan. Add 1 crumbled cinnamon stick, 1 tsp (1.8 g) of whole black peppercorn, 5 cloves, and 3 cracked green cardamom pods to the saucepan. Stir the ingredients together with a wooden spoon.[\[1\]](#_note-1)  
      
    *   You can mix and match spices to suit your tastes. Other popular spices used to make chai include fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and star anise.[\[2\]](#_note-2)
2.  Toast the spices over medium heat for 3-4 minutes. Continue to stir the spices as they cook. This will prevent them from burning, which can ruin the flavor of your chai. The spices are done toasting when they're fragrant.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

3.  Add of thinly-sliced ginger and of water. Stir these ingredients together with your other spices in the saucepan using the wooden spoon.  
      
    *   Using fresh ginger adds a note of sweetness to the spice in your chai. In traditional Indian masala chai, ginger is sometimes the only spice used.[\[4\]](#_note-4)
4.  Lower the heat to a simmer and brew the mixture for 5 minutes. Let the spices integrate into the water and mix together. You can help speed this process up by continuing to stir gently while it simmers.[\[5\]](#_note-5)  
      
    
5.  Remove the pan from the heat and add 1 tbsp (6 g) of loose-leaf tea. Stir the tea into the mixture thoroughly with the wooden spoon to help it mix with all of the spices.  
      
    *   The most commonly used teas for chai lattes are assam and ceylon. However, you can also use English breakfast or another black tea.[\[6\]](#_note-6)
    *   If you don't have loose leaf tea on hand, you can use 3 tea bags instead.
6.  Cover the pan and steep the tea for 10 minutes. Try to avoid lifting the lid while it steeps. This prevents steam and heat from escaping.

    *   For a stronger, more flavorful chai, you can choose to leave the tea to steep for longer.[\[7\]](#_note-7)
7.  Strain the tea into a teapot and cover it with a tea cosy to keep it warm. Replace the lid of the teapot and cover it with the cosy as quickly as possible after straining the tea to keep it hot while you froth the milk.[\[8\]](#_note-8)  
      
    *   If you don't have a teapot available, you can use a thermos or other insulated container.
    *   Substitute a couple of clean kitchen towels for a tea cosy if you don't have one available.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Make-Chai-Latte&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Frothing the Milk")\]Frothing the Milk

1.  Pour of whole milk into a [microwave-safe](https://www.wikihow.com/Choose-Microwave-Safe-Containers "Choose Microwave Safe Containers") jar. Leave the lid off the jar, and make sure there is no metal anywhere on the jar before putting it in the microwave.[\[9\]](#_note-9)  
      
    
    [![Make Chai Latte Step 8 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8d/Make-Chai-Latte-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/aid1382556-v4-728px-Make-Chai-Latte-Step-8-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Chai-Latte-Step-8-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   Full-fat milk is traditional, but you can also use low-fat milk, almond milk, soy milk, or any other type of milk you like.
    *   If you don't have a suitable jar on hand, you can use a bowl or other microwave-safe container instead.
2.  Microwave the milk on high for 30 seconds, or longer if necessary. Depending on your microwave, you may only have one heat setting. If the milk isn't hot when you take it out of the microwave, put it back in for 15 more seconds.[\[10\]](#_note-10)
    
    [![Make Chai Latte Step 9 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8b/Make-Chai-Latte-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/aid1382556-v4-728px-Make-Chai-Latte-Step-9-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Chai-Latte-Step-9-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   Always use caution when handling hot liquids. Be careful not to spill the milk when you remove it from the microwave and use an oven mitt or towel if the container is too hot to touch.
3.  Pour the milk into a thermos or other insulated container. Screw on the lid, making sure it's nice and tight.[\[11\]](#_note-11) The thermos will keep the milk warm while you froth it.  
      
    
4.  Shake the milk for 30-60 seconds to froth it. The longer and more vigorously you shake the milk, the frothier it will be.[\[12\]](#_note-12) When it's ready, the milk should appear foamy and whipped.  
      
    

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Make-Chai-Latte&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Combining the Ingredients and Adding Toppings")\]Combining the Ingredients and Adding Toppings

1.  Pour of tea into each mug from the teapot. Don't fill the mugs too high with tea, as you need to leave space for the milk and any toppings.[\[13\]](#_note-13) Use caution when pouring the tea, as it should still be very hot.  
      
    
2.  Add of frothed milk to the tea. Fill the remainder of the mug with the frothed milk from the insulated container.[\[14\]](#_note-14) Remember to leave a bit of extra space if you plan on adding whipped cream.  
      
    *   If you have an especially large or small mug, you may need to adjust the amount of tea and milk you pour. But try to keep the ratio roughly the same.
3.  Add honey, maple syrup, or whipped cream for a sweeter flavor. Depending on how you like your chai, you may want to sweeten your latte.[\[15\]](#_note-15) Use a small amount of sweetener to begin with, as the chai will already be flavorful due to the spices. You can always add more if you decide you want it sweeter.  
      
    *   You can also add a sprinkle of brown sugar for added sweetness and texture.
4.  Sprinkle ground cinnamon and/or nutmeg to taste. This adds a bit of extra flavor and spice to your latte as a finishing touch.[\[16\]](#_note-16) Once you're done adding your toppings, all that's left to do is enjoy your delicious chai latte!
