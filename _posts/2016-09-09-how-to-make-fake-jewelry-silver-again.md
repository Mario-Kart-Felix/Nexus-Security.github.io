    *   You can also use a soft-bristled toothbrush if you need to scrub your jewelry more.
2.  Brush the jewelry with lemon juice to break down the tarnish. Mix together equal parts lemon juice and warm water to make your cleaning solution. Let your jewelry sit in the lemon juice solution for about 10 minutes before taking it out and scrubbing it with a toothbrush. Rinse the jewelry in clean water before drying it.[\[2\]](#_note-2)  
      
    *   Don't use lemon juice without diluting first since it's highly acidic.
    *   Avoid submerging any jewelry that has fake stones since the solution could loosen the glue holding them in place.
3.  Rub toothpaste onto the jewelry to make it shine again. Squeeze a small dab of toothpaste onto a soft-bristled toothbrush and use it to scrub your jewelry. Move the brush in a circular motion and work the toothpaste into any small crevices. Keep scrubbing the jewelry until it starts to shine before rinsing it off under cold water. Dry the jewelry completely so it doesn't tarnish.[\[3\]](#_note-3)  
      
    *   Look for toothpaste made for teeth whitening since it usually has baking soda, which helps clean any discoloration on your jewelry.
4.  Put the jewelry in ketchup for 10 minutes to remove any tarnish. The acidity in ketchup can help you clean your jewelry if you're in a pinch. Put enough ketchup in a plate or bowl to cover your jewelry completely. Leave the jewelry in the ketchup for about 10 minutes so it can remove the tarnish. Rinse the ketchup off completely with cold water and dry it with a towel.[\[4\]](#_note-4)  
      
    
5.  Wipe the jewelry with soapy water if it has fake gemstones. Gemstones can easily break off if they're soaked in a solution for too long. Soak a cleaning cloth in warm water mixed with dish soap and wring it out before using it. Wipe your jewelry around the edges of the gemstones to gently clean any tarnish from it.[\[5\]](#_note-5)  
      
    *   Use a toothpick or cotton swab to get rid of tarnish in tight crevices and hard to reach places.
6.  Use metal polish to bring your jewelry back to its original shininess. Sometimes your jewelry might not shine after you've cleaned it. Apply a dab of metal polish to a cleaning cloth and wipe your jewelry with it. Work in small circular motions to buff the metal and make it shine again.[\[6\]](#_note-6)  
      
    *   You can buy metal polish from any home care store.

1.  Line a glass bowl with aluminum foil. Choose a glass bowl that's deep enough to hold all of your jewelry inside. Rip off a piece of aluminum foil large enough to fit in your bowl, and line the interior of the bowl with it. Wrap the foil around the top rim of the bowl so it stays in place.[\[7\]](#_note-7)  
      
    *   Aluminum foil will help pull any tarnish off of your jewelry so it shines again.
    *   You can also use an aluminum pie plate if you have one.
2.  Mix a solution of warm water, baking soda, and table salt. Add 1 tablespoon (14 g) of baking soda and 1 tablespoon (17 g) of table salt into the bowl. Add enough warm water into the bowl to completely submerge your pieces of jewelry. Stir the solution together with a spoon until it's thoroughly mixed.[\[8\]](#_note-8)  
      
    
3.  Submerge your jewelry in the water for 10 minutes. Set your jewelry on the bottom of the bowl so it's completely covered by the water. Leave your jewelry in the solution for 10 minutes so the tarnish breaks down. Check your jewelry after 10 minutes to see if the tarnish has lifted off of your jewelry. If not, put it back in the solution for another 2-3 minutes.[\[9\]](#_note-9)

    *   The baking soda and salt will lift the tarnish off of your jewelry and will transfer it to the aluminum foil.
    *   Don't submerge any jewelry that has glass stones or fake jewels since the solution could cause them to come loose.
4.  Scrub the jewelry with a soft toothbrush. Take your jewelry out of the cleaning solution and brush it lightly with a soft-bristled toothbrush. Focus on scrubbing any intricate designs or detailed areas that are hard to reach. Work in small circular motions to remove any tarnish and discoloration that's still on your jewelry.[\[10\]](#_note-10)

    *   Wet your toothbrush occasionally with the baking soda-salt solution to get the best clean.
5.  Rinse the jewelry and dry it with a soft towel. Once the jewelry is clean, dip it clean water to rinse off any remaining solution.

    *   You may use a hair dryer on the cool setting to speed up the drying process.[\[12\]](#_note-12)
