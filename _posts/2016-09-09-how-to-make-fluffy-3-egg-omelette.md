Omelettes are a great way to make a quick filling meal, but they can seem heavy. To make a light, fluffy [omelette](https://www.wikihow.com/Cook-an-Omelette "Cook an Omelette") that's still full of delicious flavor, separate 3 eggs. Beat the egg whites until you trap lots of air in them and they're stiff. Then, fold the yolks back in. When you spread this light batter in a skillet, the omelette will puff as it cooks and you'll be rewarded with the fluffiest 3-egg omelette ever!

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Make-a-Fluffy-3-Egg-Omelette&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Mixing the Eggs")\]Mixing the Eggs

1.  Separate the yolks and whites of 3 eggs between 2 bowls. Carefully crack an egg and let the egg white fall into 1 of the bowls. Place the yolk in the other bowl. [Separate](https://www.wikihow.com/Separate-an-Egg "Separate an Egg") the 2 remaining eggs so you have the whites in 1 bowl and the yolks in the other.[\[1\]](#_note-1)  
      
    
    [![Make a Fluffy 3 Egg Omelette Step 1 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/7f/Make-a-Fluffy-3-Egg-Omelette-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/aid3243903-v4-728px-Make-a-Fluffy-3-Egg-Omelette-Step-1-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-a-Fluffy-3-Egg-Omelette-Step-1-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   Ensure that the bowl for the egg whites is completely clean and free from grease since you'll be beating the whites. You'll get the most volume if the bowl is spotlessly clean.
2.  Add salt and pepper to the yolks and beat them with a fork. Use a generous pinch of salt and pepper and combine the yolks until they're blended. This only takes a few seconds.[\[2\]](#_note-2)  
      
    *   Set the bowl of yolks aside while you beat the egg whites.
3.  Whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Use a stand or hand mixer with clean whisk attachments to [beat the egg whites](https://www.wikihow.com/Beat-Egg-Whites "Beat Egg Whites") on high speed. Beat the eggs until they stiffen and become firm and glossy.[\[3\]](#_note-3)  
      
    *   If you don't have a stand or hand mixer, use a clean whisk.
4.  Fold the egg yolks into the stiff egg whites. Spoon half of the seasoned egg yolks into the bowl with the whites. Use a spatula to gently lift the egg whites up and over the yolks. Then, add the rest of the yolks and keep folding them in until the mixture is a uniform color.[\[4\]](#_note-4)  
      
    *   It's important to fold the whites gently so you don't lose the air that you beat into them. This helps the omelette become fluffy as it cooks.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Make-a-Fluffy-3-Egg-Omelette&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Cooking the Omelette")\]Cooking the Omelette

1.  Melt 1 tablespoon (15 g) of butter in a nonstick skillet. Turn the burner to medium and heat the unsalted butter until it melts. Hold the handle and slowly swirl the pan a little so the melted butter coats the bottom of the skillet.[\[5\]](#_note-5)  
      
    
    [![Make a Fluffy 3 Egg Omelette Step 5 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/29/Make-a-Fluffy-3-Egg-Omelette-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid3243903-v4-728px-Make-a-Fluffy-3-Egg-Omelette-Step-5-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-a-Fluffy-3-Egg-Omelette-Step-5-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   If you don't want to use butter, substitute olive oil, coconut oil, or ghee.
    *   Use a skillet to cook the omelette.
2.  Spread the egg mixture in the skillet. Gently spoon the eggs into the skillet and use the back of a spoon or an offset spatula to spread the mixture evenly across the pan. The eggs will immediately begin to cook in the hot skillet.[\[6\]](#_note-6) below a hot broiler. Broil the omelette for 2 to 4 minutes before you fold it over and serve it.}}  
      
    
3.  Cover the skillet and cook the omelette for 4 minutes. Turn the burner down to medium-low and let the omelette cook for 4 minutes without moving it or flipping it. If the top of the omelette looks like it's cooking too quickly, turn the burner down to medium-low or low.[\[7\]](#_note-7)
    
    [![Make a Fluffy 3 Egg Omelette Step 7 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/fa/Make-a-Fluffy-3-Egg-Omelette-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/aid3243903-v4-728px-Make-a-Fluffy-3-Egg-Omelette-Step-7-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-a-Fluffy-3-Egg-Omelette-Step-7-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   It's important to cover the skillet so the top of the omelette cooks. If you leave the skillet uncovered, the top may be soupy or runny even though the bottom of the omelette is cooked.
4.  Scatter cheese over the omelette and cook it for 1 more minute. If you'd like to give the omelette a more savory flavor, sprinkle 1/2 cup (55 g) of shredded Gruyère or cheddar cheese over the top. Put the lid back on the skillet and let the omelette cook for 1 more minute so the cheese melts and the omelette sets.[\[8\]](#_note-8)  
      
    *   If you don't want to add the cheese, just cook the omelette for the extra minute.
5.  Slide the omelette onto a plate and fold it over in half. Turn off the burner and slowly slide the omelette onto the plate. Use a spatula to help the omelette if it sticks at all. Then, use the spatula to [flip half of the omelette](https://www.wikihow.com/Flip-an-Omelet "Flip an Omelet") onto the other side. Scatter freshly [minced chives](https://www.wikihow.com/Cut-Chives "Cut Chives") over the omelette and serve the omelette while it's still hot and fluffy.  
      
    *   You can refrigerate leftover omelette in an airtight container for up to 4 days. Keep in mind that the omelette may lose some of its volume the longer it's stored.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Make-a-Fluffy-3-Egg-Omelette&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Trying Variations")\]Trying Variations

1.  Substitute your favorite type of cheese for the Gruyère or cheddar. Omelettes are easy to customize, so use a different type of [cheese](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Cheese-Omelette "Make a Cheese Omelette") if you like. Consider using 1/2 cup (55 g) of any of these cheeses in your fluffy omelette:[\[9\]](#_note-9)
    
    [![Make a Fluffy 3 Egg Omelette Step 10 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5f/Make-a-Fluffy-3-Egg-Omelette-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/aid3243903-v4-728px-Make-a-Fluffy-3-Egg-Omelette-Step-10-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-a-Fluffy-3-Egg-Omelette-Step-10-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   Emmentaler
    *   Swiss
    *   Goat cheese
    *   Pepperjack
    *   Feta
    *   Smoked gouda
2.  Add a spoonful of dairy to the egg yolks for an extra creamy flavor. Give the omelette a creamy, tangy texture by adding 1 tablespoon (12 g) of sour cream, plain yogurt, or Greek yogurt. Mix the dairy into the egg yolks before you fold them into the stiff egg whites.[\[10\]](#_note-10)
    
    [![Make a Fluffy 3 Egg Omelette Step 11 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/41/Make-a-Fluffy-3-Egg-Omelette-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/aid3243903-v4-728px-Make-a-Fluffy-3-Egg-Omelette-Step-11-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-a-Fluffy-3-Egg-Omelette-Step-11-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   You could use reduced-fat dairy if you're looking to cut a few calories.
3.  Stir herbs into the yolks to lighten the flavor of the omelette. To give a fresh flavor to your omelette, mix 2 tablespoons (7.5 g) of freshly minced herbs into the egg yolks before you fold them into the whites. Try using basil, parsley, chives, marjoram, or a combination of these.[\[11\]](#_note-11)
    
    [![Make a Fluffy 3 Egg Omelette Step 12 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/70/Make-a-Fluffy-3-Egg-Omelette-Step-12-Version-2.jpg/aid3243903-v4-728px-Make-a-Fluffy-3-Egg-Omelette-Step-12-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-a-Fluffy-3-Egg-Omelette-Step-12-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   If you'd rather use dried herbs, add up to 1 tablespoon of dried herbs.
4.  Top the cooked omelette with vegetables or meat before you fold it. Although you can easily add diced, cooked [vegetables](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Vegetable-Omelette "Make a Vegetable Omelette") and meat, such as [mushrooms](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Mushroom-Omelette "Make a Mushroom Omelette"), ham, or peppers, wait until you're ready to fold the omelette before you scatter them. The weight of these ingredients will make the fluffy omelette fall quickly. Consider adding any of these ingredients just before serving:[\[12\]](#_note-12)
    
    [![Make a Fluffy 3 Egg Omelette Step 13 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/50/Make-a-Fluffy-3-Egg-Omelette-Step-13-Version-2.jpg/aid3243903-v4-728px-Make-a-Fluffy-3-Egg-Omelette-Step-13-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-a-Fluffy-3-Egg-Omelette-Step-13-Version-2.jpg)
