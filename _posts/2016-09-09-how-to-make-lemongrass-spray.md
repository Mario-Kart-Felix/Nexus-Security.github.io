Lemongrass essential oil is a popular scent for homemade sprays. Its grassy, citrusy flavor combines well with other essential oils, making it effective for insect repellent or room spray. Shake the lemongrass essential oil with other insect-repelling oils before going out in mosquito-infested areas. You can also make a room spray with refreshing lemongrass, spearmint, grapefruit, and rosemary essential oils. Spritz it in the air on or linen to neutralize odors.
