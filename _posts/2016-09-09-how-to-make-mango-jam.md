Making jam is a great way to capture the natural sweetness and delicate flavor of mangoes. Chop the mangoes into small pieces and cook them with lots of sugar, lemon juice, and pectin. You can even customize your mango jam to come up with completely unique flavor combinations. Once the jam is as thick as you like, transfer it to sterilized jars and enjoy the jam on toast, waffles, or pancakes.

1.  Slice the flesh from 6 or 7 large mangoes. Rinse the mangoes and put them on a cutting board. Hold a mango against the board and carefully [cut](https://www.wikihow.com/Cut-a-Mango "Cut a Mango") down 1 side of it. Try to cut as close to the seed in the center, so you're able to remove the most fruit. Then, slice down the other side of the mango.

    *   Use a small knife to trim the flesh around the seed itself.
    *   You should get around 4 cups (660 g) of mango pieces.
2.  Put the mango pieces in a pot with sugar, lemon juice, and pectin. Place the chopped mango in a large pot on the stove. Add 1 cup (200 g) of sugar, of [lemon juice](https://www.wikihow.com/Juice-a-Lemon "Juice a Lemon"), and 2 tablespoons (25 g) of powdered pectin.[\[2\]](#_note-2)  
      
    *   The pectin helps the jam set up. If you prefer a looser jam, you can leave the pectin out.
3.  Stir the mixture and cook it over low heat until the sugar dissolves. Stir well so the mango pieces are coated with the sugar. Continue to stir the mixture every few minutes until the sugar dissolves and becomes liquidy.[\[3\]](#_note-3)  
      
    *   It should take about 3 to 4 minutes for the sugar to dissolve.
4.  Bring the jam to a boil over medium-high heat. Turn the burner up so the liquid becomes syrupy and starts to bubble vigorously. Stir the jam occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the pot or boiling over.[\[4\]](#_note-4)  
      
    *   It's important to use a large pot so the jam doesn't bubble over as it cooks.
5.  Cook the mango jam until it reaches . Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pot or occasionally insert an instant-read thermometer into the jam to see if the jam has reached the setting temperature of . Stir the jam occasionally as it bubbles and thickens.[\[5\]](#_note-5)

Get out 2 [sterilized half-pint jars](https://www.wikihow.com/Sterilize-Bottles-and-Jars-for-Canning "Sterilize Bottles and Jars for Canning") and place a funnel on a jar. Carefully spoon the mango jam into the jar and leave headspace. Place a sterilized lid on the jar and screw on a band until it's finger tight.[\[6\]](#_note-6)  
      
    *   Although you can soften the lids in hot water before pressing them on the jars, you don't have to in order to get a good seal.
7.  Process the jars or store them in the refrigerator. For long-term storage, place the jars in a water bath so they're covered by at least of water. [Boil the jars](https://www.wikihow.com/Can-Food "Can Food") for 10 minutes and then set the jars aside until the jars are at room temperature.

1.  Swap half of the mango for peaches or nectarines. Although pure mango jam is delicious, it's also fun to add another fruit to the jam. Use half of the mango called for in the recipe and replace the other half with peeled peaches, nectarines, or stonefruit. Mango also pairs well with any of these fruits:[\[8\]](#_note-8)

    *   Strawberries
    *   Papaya
    *   Pineapple

    *   Store jars of the mango jam in the fridge for up to 3 weeks.
3.  Add 1 teaspoon (2 g) of your favorite ground spice for a unique flavor. Customize your mango jam by stirring in dried spice halfway through the cooking time. You can use a single spice or a combination that equals 1 teaspoon (2 g). Consider using any of these spices or seasonings:[\[10\]](#_note-10)

    *   Cardamom

    *   If you'd like smoother spread, push the mango spread through a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl.
    *   Because there's no added sweetener to the spread, store it in the refrigerator and use it within 2 weeks.
