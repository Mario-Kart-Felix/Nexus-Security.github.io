There aren’t enough good things to say about nachos. In their classic form, they’re spicy, creamy, cheesy, crunchy, zesty and delicious, but what makes them timeless is their versatility. Take the core taste concepts - creamy, crunchy, layers - and you can let your culinary creativity shine. This article gives instructions for making classic nachos, BBQ nachos, and dessert nachos.

1.  Gather your ingredients. Classic nachos highlight the two most essential nachos ingredients: chips and cheese. Build on this foundation by adding whatever toppings you desire. Pick up the following items:
    
    [![Make Nachos Step 1 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/03/Make-Nachos-Step-1-Version-3.jpg/aid189774-v4-728px-Make-Nachos-Step-1-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Nachos-Step-1-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   Tortilla Chips: flour or corn, the fresher the better. The perfect chip is thick enough to hold serious toppings but light enough to let the other ingredients shine.
    *   Cheese: cheddar is the classic, but mozzarella, monterey jack, cotija; if it can shred, it’ll taste good. Mix them for color.
    *   Salsa: your choice. The classic is chunky pico de gallo.
    *   Sour cream: Try not to choose low fat. Sour cream gives Nachos part of their umami and balances the spice.
    *   Pickled jalapeños: available in most supermarkets. Leave these out if you can’t handle the spice.
    *   Beans: black beans or refried beans are the most popular choices. This optional ingredient adds some heft to your nachos.
    *   Meat: seasoned ground beef or shredded chicken. Adding some well-cooked and seasoned meat, while optional, can make your nachos much more satisfying.
2.  Place a mound of chips on a baking sheet. You can also use a pie dish or a casserole dish for this purpose. If you’re microwaving the nachos instead of heating them up in the oven, use a microwave-safe dish.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

3.  Add the cheese. Sprinkle a liberal amount of cheese over the nachos. Try to get some cheese on every chip.
    
    [![Make Nachos Step 3 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/fc/Make-Nachos-Step-3-Version-3.jpg/aid189774-v4-728px-Make-Nachos-Step-3-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Nachos-Step-3-Version-3.jpg)
    
4.  Cook the nachos. Nachos taste just as good whether they’re cooked in the oven or the microwave. Choose one of these cooking methods:
    
    [![Make Nachos Step 4 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0a/Make-Nachos-Step-4-Version-3.jpg/aid189774-v4-728px-Make-Nachos-Step-4-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Nachos-Step-4-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   Broil them. Set the oven rack from the heat source and broil until the cheese melts. This will usually happen in 5 minutes. Be careful not to burn the cheese. Remove and let cool for a few minutes.
    *   Microwave them. Microwave on high for 2 minutes. Remove and let cool for a few minutes.
5.  Dress the nachos. Place dollops of sour cream in a ring around the top of the nachos. Sprinkle the jalapeños and salsa on top.
    
    [![Make Nachos Step 5 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/81/Make-Nachos-Step-5-Version-3.jpg/aid189774-v4-728px-Make-Nachos-Step-5-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Nachos-Step-5-Version-3.jpg)
    
6.  Serve and enjoy. Napkins are a must; forks are scandalous. Select a nacho, dip it in some sour cream, use it to scoop a jalapeño, and eat up.
    
    [![Make Nachos Step 6 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/7d/Make-Nachos-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/aid189774-v4-728px-Make-Nachos-Step-6-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Nachos-Step-6-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   Classic nachos taste great with the addition of any of your favorite meats or vegetables. Favorites include ground beef, grilled steak or chicken, sliced sauteed mushrooms, raw minced onion, black olives, and shredded lettuce.[\[2\]](#_note-2)
    *   Individual portions can be served on small plates or in bowls; just divide the chips and melted cheese up before adding other toppings.

1.  Gather your ingredients. BBQ nachos are the potato-based alternative to classic nachos. You use potato chips and pair them with delicious BBQ meat. Go to the grocery store and get these ingredients:
    
    [![Make Nachos Step 7 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b0/Make-Nachos-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/aid189774-v4-728px-Make-Nachos-Step-7-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Nachos-Step-7-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   Potato chips: get either flavored or plain, ruffled or smooth.
    *   Cheese: choose pepperjack, cheddar or both, shredded.
    *   Salsa: pico de gallo is the clear winner for this dish, as anything saucier will compete with the BBQ.
    *   Sour cream: you can skip this if you want, but it’s surprisingly delicious with BBQ sauce.
    *   BBQ: pulled pork is available at any BBQ joint and most grocery stores. Make sure to get the sauce, too.
        *   BBQ chicken is also delicious, but never serve anything with bones.
        *   Vegetarian chili or baked beans are also great substitutes for meat.
2.  Put the potato chips on a cooking sheet. Choose a cooking dish based on your heat source, either oven broiler safe or microwavable. Build a mound of chips that covers the bottom of the pan.
    
    [![Make Nachos Step 8 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/90/Make-Nachos-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/aid189774-v4-728px-Make-Nachos-Step-8-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Nachos-Step-8-Version-2.jpg)
    
3.  Sprinkle on the cheese. Try to get an equal amount of cheese on all of the chips.
    
    [![Make Nachos Step 9 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c7/Make-Nachos-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/aid189774-v4-728px-Make-Nachos-Step-9-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Nachos-Step-9-Version-2.jpg)
    
4.  Cook the nachos. If you’re broiling, set the oven rack from the heat source and broil until the cheese melts. This will usually happen in 5 minutes. Be careful not to burn the cheese. If you’re microwaving, microwave on high for 2 minutes. Let the nachos cool for a few minutes when they’re done cooking.
    
    [![Make Nachos Step 10 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e5/Make-Nachos-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/aid189774-v4-728px-Make-Nachos-Step-10-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Nachos-Step-10-Version-2.jpg)
    
5.  Dress the nachos. Place dollops of sour cream and salsa on top of the nachos. Pile the BBQ in the middle. Sprinkle other toppings and condiments around the sides.
    
    [![Make Nachos Step 11 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6a/Make-Nachos-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/aid189774-v4-728px-Make-Nachos-Step-11-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Nachos-Step-11-Version-2.jpg)
    
6.  Serve and enjoy. Since these nachos are served with meat, you may want to offer your dinner guests a fork this time. Dish the nachos onto plates and serve with extra toppings on the side.

1.  Gather your ingredients. These dessert nachos are a delicious way to end a Mexican-themed meal. The flavors of cinnamon and sugar bring out the best in flour tortilla chips. Pick up these ingredients in preparation:
    
    [![Make Nachos Step 13 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/09/Make-Nachos-Step-13-Version-2.jpg/aid189774-v4-728px-Make-Nachos-Step-13-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Nachos-Step-13-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   Flour tortilla chips. The fresher the better, light and crispy. Try to find unsalted chips, though the contrast of sweet and salty can be nice.[\[3\]](#_note-3)
    *   2 tablespoons white sugar
    *   ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
    *   1/2 cup butter, melted
    *   Chocolate syrup
    *   Caramel syrup
    *   Whipped cream
2.  Melt the butter. Place a small saucepan on the stove and put the butter in the pan. Turn the burner to medium high and let the butter melt completely. You can also opt to just place the butter in the microwave.
    
    [![Make Nachos Step 14 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/98/Make-Nachos-Step-14-Version-2.jpg/aid189774-v4-728px-Make-Nachos-Step-14-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Nachos-Step-14-Version-2.jpg)
    
3.  Coat the chips with butter. Place the chips on a baking sheet. Drizzle the butter over the chips, doing your best to distribute it evenly. Use tongs to gently toss the chips so they get evenly coated in butter.
    
    [![Make Nachos Step 15 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d9/Make-Nachos-Step-15-Version-2.jpg/aid189774-v4-728px-Make-Nachos-Step-15-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Nachos-Step-15-Version-2.jpg)
    
4.  Add the cinnamon and sugar. Mix the cinnamon and sugar together in a small bowl, then sprinkle the mixture over the chips. Use the tongs to toss the chips to ensure they all get a coating of sugar and spice.
    
    [![Make Nachos Step 16 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/30/Make-Nachos-Step-16-Version-2.jpg/aid189774-v4-728px-Make-Nachos-Step-16-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Nachos-Step-16-Version-2.jpg)
    
5.  Bake the chips. Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake the chips for about 15 minutes, or until they turn golden brown and crispy.
    
    [![Make Nachos Step 17 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/48/Make-Nachos-Step-17-Version-2.jpg/aid189774-v4-728px-Make-Nachos-Step-17-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Nachos-Step-17-Version-2.jpg)
    
6.  Dress the nachos. Drizzle chocolate syrup and caramel sauce over the chips. Place a dollop of whipped cream in the center of the platter.

7.  Serve the dessert nachos. Put the baked chips on a large platter. Invite your guests to dig in.

    *   You can also dish out the nachos onto individual serving plates.
