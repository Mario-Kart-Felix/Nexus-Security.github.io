A pincushion is a stuffed piece of fabric that you can insert pins into. Pincushions are essential for sewing and other types of craft projects. There are many ways to make a pincushion! Sew a quick and easy square-shaped cushion, opt for a flower petal cushion for something more decorative, or make a no-sew mason jar pin cushion and sewing kit!

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Make-a-Pincushion&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Sewing a Quick and Easy Pincushion")\]Sewing a Quick and Easy Pincushion

1.  Cut out 2 fabric squares. Get a piece of cotton fabric in the color or print of your choice. A remnant is fine since you will only need about . Measure and trace the squares onto the wrong (back) side of a piece of cotton fabric. Then, cut along the lines using a pair of sharp fabric scissors.[\[1\]](#_note-1)  
      
    
    [![Make a Pincushion Step 1.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2c/Make-a-Pincushion-Step-1.jpg/aid5391053-v4-728px-Make-a-Pincushion-Step-1.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-a-Pincushion-Step-1.jpg)
    
    *   If desired, cut out circles, triangles, or hexagons instead.[\[2\]](#_note-2) squares. }}
2.  Stack and pin the fabric squares with the right (print) sides facing in. Place the fabric squares so that the right sides are facing each other and the wrong sides are facing outwards. Line up the edges of the 2 fabric pieces on all sides. Then, insert 2 pins through the center of the squares to keep them in place.[\[3\]](#_note-3)  
      
    *   Insert the pins so that they are parallel to each other and about away from the center of the square.
3.  Sew from the edges of the square leaving a opening. Set your sewing machine to the [straight stitch](https://www.wikihow.com/Sew-a-Straight-Line "Sew a Straight Line") setting and place the edge of the fabric square under the presser foot. Apply gentle pressure to begin sewing along the edge of the square. Sew until you are about away from the beginning of your stitches, and then stop sewing.[\[4\]](#_note-4)  
      
    *   Make sure to avoid the pins as you sew! Do not sew over them or you may damage your machine or the pins.
4.  Invert the fabric square and push the stuffing in through the opening. Use your fingers and the back end of a pencil to turn the square right side out. Then, grab a handful of stuffing and begin pushing it in through the opening you left in the square. Keep stuffing the square until it is nice and plump. The cushion should be firm with no air bubbles, but it should not be bursting at the seams.[\[5\]](#_note-5)  
      
    *   The type of stuffing you use can change the way the pincushion works. If you use polyester stuffing, the pincushion will be very light and soft, but if you use something like straw, it will be firmer. Steel wool can even sharpen your pins!
    *   Use the back of the pencil eraser to push in as much stuffing as possible. Just be careful not to put too much stress on the seams as you do this.[\[6\]](#_note-6)
5.  [Hand-sew](https://www.wikihow.com/Sew "Sew") the opening closed to secure the stuffing. [Thread a needle](https://www.wikihow.com/Thread-a-Needle "Thread a Needle") with a matching color thread and tie a knot at the end of it. Then, hold together the fabric along the opening and insert the needle through both layers of fabric. Pull the thread taut and then bring the needle back through the fabric on the opposite side about from where it came out. Repeat to continue stitching the opening closed.[\[7\]](#_note-7)  
      
    *   Push the needle through the fabric 1 last time and bring it out near the center of the cushion. Cut the excess thread as close to the cushion as possible to complete it.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Make-a-Pincushion&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Creating a Flower Petal Pincushion")\]Creating a Flower Petal Pincushion

1.  Trace 2 equal-sized circles onto your fabric and cut them out. Use the lid of a jar, the outside of a bowl, or another round object as your guide. Trace the circles onto the fabric using a ballpoint pen or pencil. Then, cut along the lines using a pair of sharp fabric scissors.[\[8\]](#_note-8)  
      
    
    [![Make a Pincushion Step 6.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/fc/Make-a-Pincushion-Step-6.jpg/aid5391053-v4-728px-Make-a-Pincushion-Step-6.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-a-Pincushion-Step-6.jpg)
    
    *   You can make the circles as big or small as you like.
    *   Avoid using a marker or fountain pen to trace the circles as these may bleed onto the fabric.
2.  Sew a [straight stitch](https://www.wikihow.com/Sew-a-Straight-Line "Sew a Straight Line") around the circles except for a opening. Place the fabric circles together so that their right (print or front) sides are facing each other. Then, sew a straight stitch around the outside of the circle about from the raw edges. Stop about from the opening.[\[9\]](#_note-9)  
      
    
3.  Cut around the outside of the circle with pinking shears. Cut off the excess threads at the beginning and end of the seam. Then, use pinking shears to trim around the outside of the fabric. This will help to reduce the bulk when you invert the cushion.[\[10\]](#_note-10)  
      
    *   Do not cut through the seam! Only cut along the very outer edge of the fabric.
4.  Invert the fabric and push stuffing in through the opening in the seam. Use your fingers and the back of a pencil or chopstick to invert the fabric so that the seam is hidden and the right side of the fabric is visible. Then, grab a handful of polyfill stuffing and push it into the opening.[\[11\]](#_note-11)  
      
    *   Keep adding stuffing until the cushion is nice and plump!
5.  [Thread a needle](https://www.wikihow.com/Thread-a-Needle "Thread a Needle") and hand sew the opening closed. Insert the end of a piece of thread through the eye of a needle. Pull until the ends of the thread are even and then tie a knot at the end to secure it. Insert the needle into the opening in the side of the cushion. Then, hold the 2 edges of the fabric together along the opening and insert the needle through both layers. Pull the needle until the thread is taut, and repeat![\[12\]](#_note-12)  
      
    *   Continue sewing until the opening is closed, then push the needle through the fabric at the opening 1 more time and bring it out in the center of the cushion. Cut the thread as close to the cushion as possible.
6.  Insert a threaded needle through the center of the cushion. Thread another needle in the same way as the first and tie a double knot with ends of the thread. Insert the needle through the center of the cushion and bring it back out the center of the cushion on the other side. Pull until the thread is taut and the knot is up against the fabric.[\[13\]](#_note-13)  
      
    *   Do not allow the knot to go through the fabric!
7.  Bring the needle back around to the other side of the cushion. Loop the needle over the side of the cushion, and then insert it back through in the same place as you did the first time. Pull the needle until the thread is taut and the cushion is indented slightly.[\[14\]](#_note-14)  
      
    *   This will create an indent in the cushion because of the thread squeezing around it.
8.  Continue to make segments in the cushion using the thread. Bring the needle back down along the outside of the cushion about over from where you inserted it the first time. Pull until the thread is taut and the cushion is indented. This will create a new segment.[\[15\]](#_note-15)  
      
    *   Keep repeating this until there are equally spaced segments all the way around the circle.
9.  Push the needle through the center of a button and back down again. Select a 2 hole button to use as a focal point for your pincushion.[\[16\]](#_note-16) Bring the needle up through 1 of the buttonholes and then back down through another buttonhole. After you create the last segment, bring the needle back up through the center 1 more time. Insert the needle through 1 of the holes in your button and then back down through the second hole in the button. Push the needle through the center of the cushion and back out the other side.[\[17\]](#_note-17)  
      
    *   Repeat this 1 more time to secure the button. Then, tie a knot at the end of the thread and cut the excess to secure it.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Make-a-Pincushion&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Making a Mason Jar Pincushion and Sewing Kit")\]Making a Mason Jar Pincushion and Sewing Kit

1.  Lay out a piece of cotton fabric and cut around the outside of the mason jar lid. Place the mason jar lid onto the wrong (back) side of the fabric. Use a pair of sharp fabric scissors to cut a circle about from the outside of the jar lid.[\[18\]](#_note-18)  
      
    
    [![Make a Pincushion Step 15.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/33/Make-a-Pincushion-Step-15.jpg/aid5391053-v4-728px-Make-a-Pincushion-Step-15.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-a-Pincushion-Step-15.jpg)
    
    *   Donâ€™t worry if it looks like there is too much fabric or if the circle is not perfect! You can trim it down more and clean up the edges if needed.
2.  Trace 2 circles smaller than the mason jar lid onto a piece of felt. Use a circular object that is about smaller than the mason jar lid as your guide. Then, use a marker to trace around the outer edges of the circle. Cut out the circles using a pair of sharp fabric scissors.[\[19\]](#_note-19)  
      
    *   Avoid any jagged or crooked edges along the outside of the circle.
3.  Make a sandwich of stuffing, 1 felt circle, and the jar lid. Place a handful of stuffing onto the center of your fabric circle. Then, top the stuffing with 1 of the felt circles. And then place the lid on top of the felt with the bottom of the lid facing up.[\[20\]](#_note-20)  
      
    
4.  Add hot glue around the outer edges of the lid to secure the fabric. Wait until your hot glue gun is hot (about 10 minutes), and then use it to place a few drops of hot glue around the edges of the bottom side of mason jar lid.[\[21\]](#_note-21) After adding each drop of glue, fold the fabric on that side of the lid over and press it into the hot glue.[\[22\]](#_note-22)  
      
    *   Do not touch the hot glue with your bare hands! Wear a pair of heat-proof gloves for this part.
5.  Push more stuffing into the openings to fill out the cushion. After you have glued the fabric on a few sides of the lid, push more stuffing into the openings in the sides of the cushion if needed. The fuller the cushion, the better it will be at holding your pins![\[23\]](#_note-23)  
      
    *   Be careful not to overstuff the cushion or the fabric may come undone from the lid!
6.  Keep gluing the ends of the fabric down until all of the ends are secured. After you are happy with the level of stuffing in your cushion, start gluing down the rest of the fabric. Add glue to the underside of the lid and then fold over the fabric. Work your way around the lid to secure all of the fabric and close off the cushion.[\[24\]](#_note-24)  
      
    *   The cushion will go from a loose square shape to a tight round shape as you continue gluing.
7.  Glue the other felt circle onto the bottom of the lid. To secure the ends of the fabric and hide the raw edges, add a generous line of hot glue around the inside of your other felt circle and a few dots in the center as well. Then, press the circle onto the bottom of the lid to cover the ends of the fabric.[\[25\]](#_note-25)  
      
    *   Hold the circle in place for a few seconds to ensure that the glue adheres well to the fabric.
8.  Fill the jar with notions and put the cushion lid on the jar. After the felt circle is secured, place the mason jar lid onto your jar, and screw the ring around it to secure it in place. Push your pins into the cushion on top of the jar and store sewing notions in the jar part of the pin cushion.[\[26\]](#_note-26)  
      
    *   This makes a great gift for a sewing enthusiast! Fill the jar with needles, thread, and maybe even a gift card for their favorite craft supply store!
