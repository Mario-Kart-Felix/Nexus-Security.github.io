Making snowcream is a delicious way to take advantage of living in an area that gets a lot of snow in the winter. Snowcream is just like ice cream, except it’s made with fresh snow! Snowcream is thus not only tasty and convenient, it’s also very easy to make. All you need to do is mix milk, sugar, vanilla extract, and snow in a bowl!

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Make-Snowcream&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Collecting the Snow and Keeping It Cold")\]Collecting the Snow and Keeping It Cold

1.  Clean a bowl and let it dry. Use dish soap and warm water to thoroughly clean your bowl. Let the bowl air dry overnight, or use a towel to dry it if you want to use it immediately.[\[1\]](#_note-1)  
      
    *   The bowl will need to be as clean as possible, since you’ll be eating snow that you collect in it.
    *   Making sure the bowl is dry will prevent unwanted ice forming at the bottom of it.
2.  Place the bowl in a safe location outside while it’s snowing. Put it on a picnic table or the smooth top of a dog house where it won’t be easily knocked over. Falling snow is generally much cleaner than snow on the ground, so collecting it in a bowl is the best way to get clean snow for your snowcream.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

    *   Refrain from putting the bowl on the ground to keep small animals from getting into it.
3.  Make an ice bath in a bowl and set it aside. Fill the bowl ¼ full with ice cubes and water. You’ll place the bowl of snow inside this ice bath, so be sure to not fill the bowl more than ¼ full.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

    *   If you put too much ice and water in this bowl, putting the bowl of snow inside it may cause the water to overflow and pour out of the sides.
4.  Take the bowl inside once it’s full and place it in the ice bath. You’ll want to collect of snow, which is equal to the the volume of your bowl.[\[4\]](#_note-4)  
      
    *   For best results, use the snow immediately after you collect it. However, if you can’t use it right away, storing it in the freezer until you’re reading to add the other ingredients to it is the next best thing.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Make-Snowcream&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Mixing Your Ingredients into the Snow")\]Mixing Your Ingredients into the Snow

1.  Whisk your milk, sugar, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Mix together of milk, ½ cup (50 grams) of granulated sugar, and of vanilla extract in a bowl with tall sides to prevent the milk from splashing out. Continue to whisk these ingredients until they’re fully mixed together.[\[5\]](#_note-5)  
      
    *   You can use any type of milk for this step, even condensed milk!
    *   If you want to make flavored snowcream, use chocolate or strawberry milk for this step.
2.  Add the milk and sugar mixture to your snow. Use a wooden spoon to mix the milk mixture and the snow together. Chop and stir the ingredients with the spoon until they begin to resemble the consistency of ice cream.[\[6\]](#_note-6)  
      
    *   Make sure the ingredients are evenly mixed, as well. You shouldn’t see any lumps of sugar or dark spots in your mixture.
3.  Add toppings to your snowcream, if desired, and serve. The snowcream melts pretty quickly, so serve it right away in small bowls for the best results. Some examples of toppings to put on your snowcream include sprinkles, chocolate chips, cherries, or whipped cream.[\[7\]](#_note-7)  
      
    *   Unfortunately, storing your snowcream in the freezer will lead it to freeze into a solid block of ice, so you’ll have to eat it right away.
