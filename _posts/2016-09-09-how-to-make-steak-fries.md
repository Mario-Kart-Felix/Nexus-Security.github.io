Steak fries are like French fries, except that they are much thicker and typically baked in the oven instead of fried. They go great with steaks, hamburgers, and other grilled sandwiches. There are also countless ways of seasoning them, from a simple dash of salt and pepper to garlic and Parmesan cheese. Whichever method you choose, you are bound to end up with a tasty, delicious treat!

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Make-Steak-Fries&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Making Basic Steak Fries")\]Making Basic Steak Fries

1.  Preheat your oven to 400°F (205°C).
    
    [![Make Steak Fries Step 1 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6d/Make-Steak-Fries-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/aid1755596-v4-728px-Make-Steak-Fries-Step-1-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Steak-Fries-Step-1-Version-2.jpg)
    
2.  Clean the potatoes and cut them into ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) thick wedges. Scrub the potatoes clean with a vegetable scrubbing brush and cool water, then cut them into wedges. You do not need to peel them, as the skins are part of their appeal.
    
    [![Make Steak Fries Step 2 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/fa/Make-Steak-Fries-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/aid1755596-v4-728px-Make-Steak-Fries-Step-2-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Steak-Fries-Step-2-Version-2.jpg)
    
3.  Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, then add the butter. Stir the butter until it melts. Have the potatoes ready. You will be frying them first; this will help give them a crispier texture as well as cut down on the baking time.
    
    [![Make Steak Fries Step 3 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/df/Make-Steak-Fries-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid1755596-v4-728px-Make-Steak-Fries-Step-3-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Steak-Fries-Step-3-Version-2.jpg)
    
4.  Toss in the potatoes, then fry them for 10 minutes. Add the potatoes and toss them until they are covered in the oil and butter mixture. Cook them for 10 minutes, tossing them from time to time. Don't worry if they still look raw by the time you are done.
    
    [![Make Steak Fries Step 4 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2a/Make-Steak-Fries-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid1755596-v4-728px-Make-Steak-Fries-Step-4-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Steak-Fries-Step-4-Version-2.jpg)
    
5.  Season the potatoes with salt and pepper. Add the salt and pepper straight to the skillet. Cover the skillet with a lid, then shake it a few times to toss the potatoes inside.
    
    [![Make Steak Fries Step 5 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/66/Make-Steak-Fries-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid1755596-v4-728px-Make-Steak-Fries-Step-5-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Steak-Fries-Step-5-Version-2.jpg)
    
6.  Spread the potatoes onto a large, ungreased baking sheet in an even layer. Don't clump or pile the potatoes. If the baking sheet is too small, it would be better to set the extra potatoes aside and bake them in a separate batch.
    
    [![Make Steak Fries Step 6 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/77/Make-Steak-Fries-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/aid1755596-v4-728px-Make-Steak-Fries-Step-6-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Steak-Fries-Step-6-Version-2.jpg)
    
7.  Bake the potatoes for 20 minutes, turning them halfway through. Put the baking sheet with the potatoes into the oven and bake them for 10 minutes. Flip the potatoes over using a spatula, then bake them for another 10 minutes. The steak fries are ready when they are golden brown and crispy.

8.  Serve the steak fries immediately. They go great with steak as well as other dishes, including hamburgers and grilled cheese sandwiches.

1.  Preheat your oven to 400°F (205°C).
    
    [![Make Steak Fries Step 9.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e0/Make-Steak-Fries-Step-9.jpg/aid1755596-v4-728px-Make-Steak-Fries-Step-9.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Steak-Fries-Step-9.jpg)
    
2.  Clean the potatoes and cut them into wedges. Scrub the potatoes clean, then cut them into ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) thick wedges. Leave the skins on the potatoes.
    
    [![Make Steak Fries Step 10.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/04/Make-Steak-Fries-Step-10.jpg/aid1755596-v4-728px-Make-Steak-Fries-Step-10.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Steak-Fries-Step-10.jpg)
    
3.  Mix the oil and spices together in a large bowl. Put the paprika, ground cumin, salt, and black pepper into the bowl first, and mix them briskly together with a fork. Stir in the oil next until everything is evenly combined.
    
    [![Make Steak Fries Step 11.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/63/Make-Steak-Fries-Step-11.jpg/aid1755596-v4-728px-Make-Steak-Fries-Step-11.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Steak-Fries-Step-11.jpg)
    
4.  Add the potatoes to the bowl and toss them until they are evenly coated. An easy way to do this is to cover the bowl with a large plate, lid, or plastic wrap, and then shake it a few times to toss the ingredients together.
    
    [![Make Steak Fries Step 12.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0d/Make-Steak-Fries-Step-12.jpg/aid1755596-v4-728px-Make-Steak-Fries-Step-12.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Steak-Fries-Step-12.jpg)
    
5.  Spread the potato wedges onto a large, ungreased baking sheet. Do not crowd the potatoes. If your baking sheet is too small, it is better to set the extra potatoes aside and bake them in a separate batch. This will allow them to turn nice and crispy.
    
    [![Make Steak Fries Step 13.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3a/Make-Steak-Fries-Step-13.jpg/aid1755596-v4-728px-Make-Steak-Fries-Step-13.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Steak-Fries-Step-13.jpg)
    
6.  Bake the potatoes, uncovered, for 40 minutes. After about 20 minutes, use a spatula to flip them over. This will ensure that both sides get evenly baked and turn crispy. The fries are ready when they turn golden brown and crispy.
    
    [![Make Steak Fries Step 14.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d9/Make-Steak-Fries-Step-14.jpg/aid1755596-v4-728px-Make-Steak-Fries-Step-14.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Steak-Fries-Step-14.jpg)
    
7.  Serve the fries immediately. They go great with steaks as well as other dishes, including homemade burgers and grilled cheese sandwiches.

1.  Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).
    
    [![Make Steak Fries Step 16.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b3/Make-Steak-Fries-Step-16.jpg/aid1755596-v4-728px-Make-Steak-Fries-Step-16.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Steak-Fries-Step-16.jpg)
    
2.  Clean the potatoes and cut them into ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) thick wedges. You do not need to peel the potatoes, but make sure that you scrub them clean.
    
    [![Make Steak Fries Step 17.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/13/Make-Steak-Fries-Step-17.jpg/aid1755596-v4-728px-Make-Steak-Fries-Step-17.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Steak-Fries-Step-17.jpg)
    
3.  Toss the potatoes in a large mixing bowl with the olive oil until they are evenly coated. Put the potatoes into the bowl first, then drizzle the olive oil over them. Gently toss them until they are evenly coated with the oil. You can do this with a pair of salad tongs, by hand, or by covering the bowl with a large plate, lid, or plastic wrap, and then shaking it.
    
    [![Make Steak Fries Step 18.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/75/Make-Steak-Fries-Step-18.jpg/aid1755596-v4-728px-Make-Steak-Fries-Step-18.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Steak-Fries-Step-18.jpg)
    
4.  Add the garlic, thyme, and ¼ teaspoon of salt, and toss again. To ensure that everything mixes evenly, combine the garlic, thyme, and salt in a separate cup, then add them to the mixing bowl. Save the rest of the salt for later.
    
    [![Make Steak Fries Step 19.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/16/Make-Steak-Fries-Step-19.jpg/aid1755596-v4-728px-Make-Steak-Fries-Step-19.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Steak-Fries-Step-19.jpg)
    
5.  Spread the potatoes in an even layer on an ungreased baking sheet. Do not crowd them. If your baking sheet is not big enough, set the extra potatoes aside and bake them in a separate batch. Leave any leftover oil in the bowl; you can use it again later in the recipe.
    
    [![Make Steak Fries Step 20.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/25/Make-Steak-Fries-Step-20.jpg/aid1755596-v4-728px-Make-Steak-Fries-Step-20.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Steak-Fries-Step-20.jpg)
    
6.  Bake the potatoes in the oven for 30 minutes, flipping them over part way through baking. Place the baking sheet into the oven, and bake the potatoes for 15 minutes. Flip them over with a spatula, and bake them for another 15 minutes. This ensures that both sides get evenly roasted.
    
    [![Make Steak Fries Step 21.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/ee/Make-Steak-Fries-Step-21.jpg/aid1755596-v4-728px-Make-Steak-Fries-Step-21.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Steak-Fries-Step-21.jpg)
    
    *   Don't worry if they don't look well-done when you take them out; you aren't done baking them just yet!
7.  Toss the fries in the bowl with parsley and part of the Parmesan cheese. Take the fries out of the oven and put them back into the large mixing bowl with the olive oil. Sprinkle them with the fresh, chopped parsley and ½ cup (50 grams) of Parmesan cheese. Save the rest of the Parmesan cheese for later.
    
    [![Make Steak Fries Step 22.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/fe/Make-Steak-Fries-Step-22.jpg/aid1755596-v4-728px-Make-Steak-Fries-Step-22.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Steak-Fries-Step-22.jpg)
    
8.  Bake the fries in the oven for another 10 minutes. Once you have the fries evenly coated, spread them on the baking sheet and bake them for another 10 minutes. This will melt the cheese just enough so that it's oozy but not so much that it gets completely burnt.
    
    [![Make Steak Fries Step 23.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/ac/Make-Steak-Fries-Step-23.jpg/aid1755596-v4-728px-Make-Steak-Fries-Step-23.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Make-Steak-Fries-Step-23.jpg)
    
9.  Garnish the fries with the remaining Parmesan cheese and salt and serve. Take the fries out of the oven and transfer them to a serving platter. Sprinkle ¼ cup (25 grams) of Parmesan cheese and ¼ teaspoon of salt over them. Serve the fries immediately.
