Valentine's day is a great opportunity to show someone that you care. While you can always buy a card from the store, a handmade card will be more personal and unique. Best of all, you can cater the card to the recipient's likes, hobbies, and personality. If you don't want to make a typical card, then you can make an unusual card instead, such as a sugar cookie!

    *   For a fancier card, draw heart shapes around the message using a white crayon or white grease pencil.
    *   The paper must be white or the watercolor won't show up.
2.  Paint watercolor hearts, then write messages in them with black marker. Fold a sheet of cardstock or watercolor paper in half to make a card. Paint a heart using watercolor, then let it dry. Use a black felt-tipped pen to write a message inside the heart.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

    *   Write a simple message, such as "I <3 U" or "Be Mine".
3.  Use heart-shaped cookie cutters and paint to stamp designs. Fold a sheet of cardstock or watercolor paper in half to make a card. Paint a rectangle with [watercolor](https://www.wikihow.com/Paint-With-Watercolors "Paint With Watercolors") on the front, leaving a 1/2-inch (1.3-cm) border all around. Let the paint dry, then dip a heart-shaped cookie cutter into acrylic paint. Press the cookie cutter against the card to create a heart-shaped outline.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

    *   Use Valentine's day colors for the watercolor and acrylic paint, such as red, white, pink, or purple. Use contrasting colors for the acrylic paint to help the heart stand out.
    *   You can create as many hearts as you want. You can even use large, medium, and small cookie cutters. Overlap the hearts for a more interesting design.
4.  Use glitter and glue to create a sparkly card. Fold a sheet of cardstock in half to make a card. Draw a heart with white school glue, then shake red or pink glitter onto it. Tap the excess glitter off and let it write. Write a message with white school glue, then add more glitter. Shake the excess glitter off and let it dry as well.

    *   [Decorate the card](https://www.wikihow.com/Decorate-Cards "Decorate Cards") with rhinestones or sequins for a fancier effect.
5.  Cut a sponge into a heart, then use it as a stamp. Get a flat sponge (not a sea sponge) and cut it into a large heart. Dip it into acrylic craft paint, poster paint, or tempera paint. Lightly tape the sponge against a sheet of cardstock, then remove the sponge and let the paint dry. Write your message on the paper or on the heart itself.

    *   Sprinkle some glitter onto the paint before it dries for a sparkly effect.
    *   Write the message with a marker. You can also use more paint and a thin, pointed paintbrush.

    *   Write the letter "I" above the heart, and the letter "U" below it to spell out "I <3 U."
    *   For a fancier card, use a sewing machine to sew 2 rows of stitching around the heart.
    *   Use a white or brown blank card. If you can't find one, fold a sheet of 8 1/2 by 11-inch (22 by 28-cm) scrapbooking paper in half, and use that instead.
3.  Glue folded paper hearts to the front of a blank card to make a bouquet. Cut 1-inch (2.5-cm) heart shapes out of red, pink, and purple paper. Doodle designs on them with a black or white pen, then fold them in half to create creases. Hot glue the hearts along the creases to a blank white card.

4.  Add a mini garland to the inside of a card. Fold a sheet of cardstock to make a card, then open the card. Cut a piece of baker's twine to the width of the open card. Tape the ends of the twine to the side edges of the card with washi tape. Cut 1-inch (2.5-cm) hearts out of scrapbooking paper and clip them to the twine with mini clothespins.[\[7\]](#_note-7)

    *   Make sure that the washi tape extends the entire length of the card from top-to-bottom. Alternatively, glue 1/4-inch (0.64-cm) strips of paper over the edges of the card.
    *   You can find mini clothespins in the scrapbooking section and wood crafts section of a craft store. They are less than tall.
5.  Sew a mini felt heart bunting to the front of a blank card. Cut 1-inch (2.5-cm) hearts out of red and pink felt. Thread a needle, then weave the needle up and down through the top of the hearts to make a bunting. Glue the bunting across the top edge of a blank card, then write your message under it.[\[8\]](#_note-8)

    *   Glue the beginning of the thread under the first heart, and the end of the thread under the last heart.
