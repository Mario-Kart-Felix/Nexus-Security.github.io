--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Make-Vanilla-Cupcakes&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Mixing the Batter")\]Mixing the Batter

1.  Preheat the oven to and line a muffin tin. Get out a 12-hole muffin tin and put paper liners in each of the spaces. The liners will make it easy to remove and serve the cupcakes. Set the tin aside while you make the batter.[\[1\]](#_note-1)  
      
    *   If you don't have paper liners, spray the inside of the muffin tin with a nonstick cooking spray.
2.  Whisk the flour, baking powder, salt, and lemon zest. Put 1 1/2 cups (195 g) of all-purpose flour into a bowl and add 1 1/2 teaspoons (6 g) of baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon (1.5 g) of salt, and the [zest of 1 large lemon](https://www.wikihow.com/Zest-a-Lemon "Zest a Lemon"). Whisk the dry ingredients until they're combined. Set the bowl aside.[\[2\]](#_note-2)  
      
    *   Avoid using self-rising flour since this recipe already includes baking powder and salt.
    *   The lemon zest won't make the cupcakes taste like citrus. Instead, the zest will intensify the vanilla flavor of the cupcakes.
3.  Beat the butter for 1 minute at medium speed. Put 1/2 cup (113 g) of butter that's at room temperature into the bowl of a stand mixer. Turn the mixer on to medium speed and beat the butter until it's creamy and smooth.[\[3\]](#_note-3)  
      
    *   If you don't have a stand mixer, use a regular mixing bowl and beat the butter with a hand mixer or wooden spoon.
4.  Cream the butter with the sugar for 2 minutes on medium speed. Add 2/3 cup (130 g) of granulated white sugar and continue to beat the butter. The butter and sugar mixture should become pale, light, and fluffy once you've creamed it long enough.[\[4\]](#_note-4)  
      
    *   Stop the mixer occasionally so you can scrape down the sides of the bowl.
5.  Beat in 3 eggs one at a time. Keep the mixer running on medium and add 1 room temperature egg. Beat the mixture for about 30 seconds after adding the egg so it's incorporated. Add the remaining 2 eggs, beating the mixture well after each one.[\[5\]](#_note-5)  
      
    *   You may need to stop and scrape the sides of the bowl.
6.  Mix in the vanilla extract. Pour of vanilla extract into the batter and beat it in for about 30 seconds. The vanilla will flavor the cupcakes, so it's important to use pure vanilla extract.[\[6\]](#_note-6)  
      
    *   The batter will look very thin or runny because of the eggs and vanilla. Don't worry if it looks curdled because the batter will come together once you add the dry ingredients.
7.  Beat in 1/3 of the dry mix and then of the milk. Turn the mixer to low speed and slowly beat in 1/3 of the dry mixture. Once it's absorbed, pour in the milk.[\[7\]](#_note-7)  
      
    *   Scrape the sides of the bowl down occasionally so the batter is uniform. It should be completely smooth with no lumps of flour visible.
8.  Beat in the remaining dry mix and milk. Mix in another 1/3 of the dry mixture and then beat in the remaining of milk. Finish making the batter by mixing in the last 1/3 of the dry ingredients.[\[8\]](#_note-8)  
      
    *   Avoid beating the batter for too long or the cupcakes will become tough. Stop beating as soon as the flour and milk are combined.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Make-Vanilla-Cupcakes&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Baking the Cupcakes")\]Baking the Cupcakes

1.  Divide the batter between the paper-lined muffin cavities. Set your lined muffin tin on your work surface and use a cookie scoop to fill each cavity about half full with batter. Ensure that each cavity has roughly the same amount of batter so the cupcakes bake evenly.[\[9\]](#_note-9)  
      
    *   If you don't have a cookie scoop, use 1 or 2 spoons to scoop the batter into the tin.
    *   To make mini-cupcakes, spray a mini-cupcake tin and divide the batter between 24 mini-cavities.
2.  Bake the vanilla cupcakes for 17 to 20 minutes. Put the muffin tin into the preheated oven and bake the cupcakes until they spring back when you gently touch them in the center.[\[10\]](#_note-10)

    *   You can also test to see if the cupcakes are done by inserting a toothpick into the center of a cupcake. If the toothpick comes out clean, the cupcakes are done.
3.  Cool the cupcakes on a wire rack. Remove the baked vanilla cupcakes from the oven and turn them out onto a wire rack. Leave them to cool completely before you frost them.[\[11\]](#_note-11)

    *   Avoid frosting the cupcakes while they're still warm or the frosting will slide off of the cupcakes.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Make-Vanilla-Cupcakes&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Making the Buttercream")\]Making the Buttercream

1.  Whip the butter on medium-high speed for 5 minutes. Put 1 cup (227 g) of room temperature butter into the bowl of a stand mixer. Turn the mixer to medium-high and beat the butter until it becomes light and fluffy.[\[12\]](#_note-12)  
      
    *   Stop the mixer and scrape the sides of the bowl once or twice.
    *   If you don't have a stand mixer, use a mixing bowl and beat the butter with a hand mixer or wooden spoon.
2.  Beat in the powdered sugar on low speed. Turn the mixer speed down to low and slowly add 2½ cups (283 g) of powdered sugar to the creamed butter. It will take up to 1 minute for the powdered sugar to combine with the butter.[\[13\]](#_note-13)  
      
    *   If you add the powdered sugar while the mixer is still on medium-high speed, it will fly out of the sides of the bowl.
3.  Mix in the vanilla extract and beat the frosting for 2 minutes. Turn the mixer speed up to medium-high and pour in of vanilla extract. Beat the vanilla buttercream until it's pale and fluffy.[\[14\]](#_note-14)  
      
    *   Stop and scrape down the bowl as needed.
4.  Frost the cooled cupcakes. Once the cupcakes have cooled completely, use an offset spatula to spread some of the vanilla buttercream over each of them. Then top the cupcakes with garnishes if you like and serve them.[\[15\]](#_note-15)  
      
    *   For a decorative look, [pipe the frosting](https://www.wikihow.com/Decorate-Cupcakes "Decorate Cupcakes") onto the cupcakes.
    *   Garnishes include sprinkles, edible flowers, cocoa powder, small candies, and fresh berries.
    *   To store the cupcakes, keep them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days or in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
