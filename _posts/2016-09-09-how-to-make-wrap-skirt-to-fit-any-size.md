1.  Choose a fabric that moves easily for a comfortable wrap skirt. You can use any type of fabric that you like for your wrap skirt, but cotton or jersey are great choices.

    *   You can also opt for a sheer fabric, but you’ll need to wear leggings or a slip under it.
2.  Wrap the measuring tape around your waist and multiply the measurement by 1.5. Hold 1 end of the measuring tape and wrap the other end around your waist. Pull the measuring tape so that it’s snug around your waist and check the measurement. Then, multiply the measurement by 1.5. This is an easy way to determine how wide you’ll need to cut the fabric for your skirt. Another option is to wrap the fabric around your waist 1.5 times and mark where this length ends.[\[1\]](#_note-1)  
      
    *   For example, if your waist is , then multiplying that number by 1.5 would give you .
3.  Cut the fabric to the desired dimensions of your skirt plus . Measure against your leg to decide how long you want the skirt to be and use this as your other measurement. Then, add to this measurement and to the waist multiplied by 1.5. The will provide extra fabric for the seam allowances.[\[2\]](#_note-2) Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut the fabric to these dimensions.[\[3\]](#_note-3)  
      
    *   For example, if the waist times 1.5 is , then adding gives you . If you want the skirt to be long, then adding gives you . This means that you’d need to cut the fabric to by .
4.  Cut a wide rectangle 3 times your waist measurement for the waistband. This will ensure that you’ll have plenty of fabric for the waistband. If you don’t have enough fabric to do this in one long strip, cut 2 strips that are half the total length you need and then sew them together.[\[4\]](#_note-4)  
      
    *   For example, if your waist measurement was , then you’ll need a wide strip that is long.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Make-a-Wrap-Skirt-to-Fit-Any-Size&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Folding the Fabric")\]Folding the Fabric

1.  Fold the waistband piece in half lengthwise. Lay the waistband piece on a flat surface with the wrong (back) side of the fabric facing up. You’ll need a large, hard surface to work on, such as a table or clean area of a hardwood or linoleum floor. Then, fold the raw edges of the piece so that they’re lining up. Press hard along the fold to create a crease.[\[5\]](#_note-5)  
      
    *   Another option is to iron along the fold to crease it. This may be necessary if the fabric doesn’t crease easily. Use the lowest setting on your iron to make a crease.[\[6\]](#_note-6)
2.  Open up the fabric and fold the edges to line up with the center crease. Once you’ve created a crease in the center of the strip, open it up again. Then, fold each of the long edges of the strip in so that they’re lining up with the crease.[\[7\]](#_note-7)  
      
    *   Make sure that you fold the 2 pieces towards each other so they are meeting at the crease.
3.  [Iron](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-an-Iron "Use an Iron") along the folded edges to crease them. Sewing the waistband will be easier if you press the edges flat with an iron. Use an iron on the lowest setting and run it along the folded edges of the waistband.[\[8\]](#_note-8)  
      
    
4.  Fold the strip in half again. After you have pressed the folded edge, fold the waistband strip in half lengthwise again. This will hide the raw edges on the inside of the strip. You may insert pins or iron the strip to keep it in this position until you’re ready to sew it.[\[9\]](#_note-9)  
      
    *   Remember to remove the pins as you sew to avoid sewing over one of them. This will damage your sewing machine.
5.  Fold of the top edge and sides twice. Next, lay the skirt fabric with the wrong (back) side facing up. Then, fold over the top of fabric so that the raw edges are going in towards the wrong side of the fabric. Then, fold the edge over by again and insert pins in the fabric to keep it folded. This will completely hide the raw edges of the fabric and you’ll be read to sew it.[\[10\]](#_note-10)  
      
    *   Repeat this for both sides of the skirt and the top edge, but don’t worry about the bottom edge yet.

1.  [Sew a straight stitch](https://www.wikihow.com/Sew-a-Straight-Line "Sew a Straight Line") to hem the side of the skirt piece. Once you have folded the edges of the skirt, take the fabric to the sewing machine and place it under the presser foot. Sew a straight stitch along each of these edges to secure the folded fabric.[\[11\]](#_note-11)  
      
    *   Make sure to remove the pins as you sew. Don’t sew over the pins or you may damage your machine.
2.  Locate the center of the waistband and top edge of the skirt. Fold the waistband in half so that the ends are lined up. Then, insert a pin to indicate the center of the waistband. Fold the skirt piece in half as well and insert a pin near the top edge to indicate the center of the piece.[\[12\]](#_note-12)  
      
    
3.  Insert pins to connect the waistband to the top edge of the skirt. Lay the waistband with the folded edge (where the 2 layers meet) facing away from you. Then, place the skirt piece over the waistband with the wrong (back) side of the fabric facing up. Arrange the 2 pieces so that the edges and the center lines are lining up.[\[13\]](#_note-13)  
      
    
4.  Sew a straight stitch to attach the waistband to the skirt. Once the waistband and the skirt are pinned together, take the 2 pieces to your sewing machine. Sew a straight stitch starting at 1 end of the waistband, going all the way down along the edge of the skirt, and to the opposite end of the waistband. Keep the stitch about from the edge of the waistband and skirt.[\[14\]](#_note-14)

1.  Adjust the skirt length if needed. After you have finished sewing the skirt together, put it on to see if the length is where you want it to be. If you’d like it a little shorter, then mark where you want it to fall on the fabric. Then, lay the fabric out flat and cut the fabric below this point to make room for the seam allowance.[\[15\]](#_note-15)  
      
    *   Make sure to use a sharp pair of scissors to cut across the fabric. Go slowly and cut straight to avoid leaving any jagged edges.
2.  [Hem](https://www.wikihow.com/Hem "Hem") the skirt by folding over the edge twice and sewing a straight stitch. Next, fold of the fabric along the bottom edge of the skirt going in towards the wrong side. Then, fold it over by again. Secure the folded edge of the skirt with pins and then sew a straight stitch along the folded edge.[\[16\]](#_note-16)  
      
    *   Remove the pins as you sew to avoid damaging your sewing machine.
3.  Trim the ends of the waistband and hem them. After you finish sewing the bottom edge of the skirt, check the length of the waistband ties. If you want to shorten them, cut off the desired amount. Then, push of the raw edges at the ends of the waistband inwards so that they are hidden. Sew a straight stitch about from the ends of the waistband to secure the fabric.[\[17\]](#_note-17)  
      
    *   After you have finished the ends of the waistband, your skirt is complete! Wrap it around your waist and tie it in a bow or knot to secure it.
