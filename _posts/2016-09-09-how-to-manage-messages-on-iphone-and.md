If you are using iOS 13, you would most probably be aware of the [three-finger gestures](https://beebom.com/how-use-text-editing-gestures-ios-13-ipados-13/) that make it pretty easy to copy, cut, paste and undo/redo text. But I bet the two-finger tap gestures, which work elegantly inside Apple’s stock messaging app, may have slipped through your radar. In fact, I had also almost given them a miss until I stumbled upon them a couple of days back. Finding them quite neat, I thought it would be cool to write a short piece about how to edit messages on iPhone and iPad with two-finger tap gestures. So, if you would like to give a shot to this all-new feature, jump right in to learn how you can manage messages on your iOS 13 or iPadOS 13 devices with quick gestures.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

  

You can access the edit mode both on the messages view and inside a specific conversation thread. Times when you may find your messaging app cluttered with too many redundant messages, these gestures can help you easily select multiple messages and wipe them out instantly. Oh yes, they can also make the process of forwarding many iMessages at one go a more straightforward task. Enough talk, let’s get going!  

### Use Two-Finger Tap to Manage Conversation Threads

  

1\. Open the **Messages** app on your iPhone or iPad.
