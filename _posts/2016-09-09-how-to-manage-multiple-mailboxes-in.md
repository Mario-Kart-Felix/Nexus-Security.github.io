A significant advantage of using Outlook on your computer is you can have multiple email accounts in one place. Here’s how you can manage everything successfully.

If you’ve only used Outlook at work, you might not realize it can handle multiple accounts from multiple providers, including Microsoft, Gmail, Yahoo!, and pretty much any others you can think of.

If you want to add email accounts to Outlook, [we walk you through the process here](https://www.howtogeek.com/435947/how-to-set-up-a-pop3-or-imap-account-in-microsoft-outlook/). After you have all your accounts set up, you can manage all of them in Outlook. Let’s take a look at how you do this.

How to Switch Between Email Accounts
------------------------------------

After you add another email account, you’ll see it in the sidebar under your original account. To switch from the first account to the second, just select its inbox.

You can add the second account’s inbox to [the “Favorites” section of the Navigation pane](https://www.howtogeek.com/393870/how-to-customise-the-navigation-pane-in-outlook/). This is useful, but then you have two Inbox folders in the Favorites section, which might get a bit confusing.

Because the Inbox is one of the core email folders, you can’t rename it. Instead, Outlook automatically adds the name of the email account to the Inbox folder in the Favorites section, so you know which is which.
