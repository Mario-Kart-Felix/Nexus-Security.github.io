Apple makes it easy to download an app or to rent a movie on your iPhone or iPad. But what if you want to change the default password behavior for App Store and iTunes Store? Here’s how to manage your password preferences.

Turn off Touch ID and Face ID for App Store and iTunes Store
------------------------------------------------------------

If you’re using any modern iPhone with Touch ID or [Face ID](https://www.howtogeek.com/425479/how-to-speed-up-face-id-on-your-iphone/), you won’t be prompted to set your password preference in the App Store app. Touch ID and Face ID will override your previous preferences (if any).

As such, if you don’t want to be prompted for authentication for buying apps, you’ll still get a Touch ID or Face ID prompt. The only way to access those password management settings is to first disable Touch ID or Face ID authentication for the App Store and iTunes Store.

To do this, open the “Settings” app and go to the “Face ID & Passcode” or “Touch ID & Passcode” section, depending on your device.

From the next screen, enter your lockscreen passcode to authenticate.

Here, tap on the toggle next to “iTunes & App Store” to disable Face ID or Touch ID authentication for App Store and iTunes Store.
