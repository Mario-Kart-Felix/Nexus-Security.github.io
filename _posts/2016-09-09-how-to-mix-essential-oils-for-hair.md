Hair loss is common, but it can be quite frustrating. If you’ve noticed a decrease in the thickness of your hair, you might benefit from using essential oils. Some studies have indicated that massaging essential oils into your scalp daily may help to [promote hair growth](https://www.wikihow.com/Encourage-Hair-Growth "Encourage Hair Growth"). However, it’s important to [mix essential oils with a carrier oil](https://www.wikihow.com/Mix-Essential-Oils-with-Carrier-Oils "Mix Essential Oils with Carrier Oils") for safety reasons and to get the best results from this treatment. Make your own essential oil hair tonic and use it daily for best results.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Mix-Essential-Oils-for-Hair-Growth&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Choosing Oils")\]Choosing Oils

1.  Opt for lavender oil for thicker, fuller hair and anti-inflammatory effects. Lavender oil has been shown to promote hair growth by thickening strands, deepening roots, increasing the number of strands, and it may also help to reduce inflammation in your scalp by reducing the number of mast cells. This could help to reduce future hair loss. It also has a soothing scent, so this might be a good option for something to help you relax, such as before going to bed at night or after a busy day at work.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   Lavender is widely available in grocery stores, drug stores, and online.
2.  Go with peppermint oil for thicker, stronger hair with more strands. Peppermint oil can help to promote hair growth by increasing the thickness, number, and strength of your strands. Many people also find the scent of peppermint invigorating or refreshing. This might be a good option if you plan to use your hair tonic after your morning shower.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

    *   Peppermint essential oil is easy to find in grocery stores, drug stores, and online.
3.  Try Hinoki cypress oil for antibacterial and antifungal properties. Hinoki cypress (Chamycyparis obtusa) helps to promote hair growth, but the exact mechanism is unclear.

You could also mix this oil in with lavender or peppermint to boost their effects.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

    *   This oil may be more difficult to find. Try looking in the essential oil section of your grocery or drug store, but you may need to purchase the oil online.
4.  Combine rosemary, lavender, cedar, and thyme for a time-honored mixture. This combination of essential oils has long been recommended to help promote hair growth. Studies have shown that using these oils is more effective than using a carrier oil alone. The combination of these oils will result in a more complex scent with an herbal or woodsy character.[\[4\]](#_note-4)

However, if you're using a blend of 4 oils, add 10 drops of each oil for a total of 40. Count the drops for each of the oils you add to get the correct amount. Don't use more than 40 drops or your solution may be too concentrated.[\[10\]](#_note-10)

    *   An ideal percentage for massage solutions is no more than 1% essential oil, or 3 drops per of fluid.

1.  Spritz the hair tonic all over your scalp after cleansing your hair. This hair tonic works best when your hair is wet, so use it right after you wash your hair. Spritz the tonic all over your scalp, but you may want to spray a little extra on any areas where the hair is thinner.[\[12\]](#_note-12)
    
    [![Mix Essential Oils for Hair Growth Step 10.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/64/Mix-Essential-Oils-for-Hair-Growth-Step-10.jpg/aid11464459-v4-728px-Mix-Essential-Oils-for-Hair-Growth-Step-10.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Mix-Essential-Oils-for-Hair-Growth-Step-10.jpg)
    
    *   If you don’t wash your hair every day, wet it in the shower or spritz it with a spray bottle of plain water before you spray on the tonic.
2.  Massage the oil into your scalp using your fingertips. Press your fingertips against your scalp and rub your scalp all over using circular motions. Continue to massage your scalp in this way for about 3 to 5 minutes.[\[13\]](#_note-13)
