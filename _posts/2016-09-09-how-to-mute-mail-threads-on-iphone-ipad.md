There’s no way to leave email conversations if someone accidentally hits the “Reply All” button. What you can do is mute the conversation on your end to disable notifications. Here’s how to mute threads on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac using the Mail app.

How to Mute Mail Threads on iPhone and iPad
-------------------------------------------

To mute a thread on an iPhone or iPad, you need to be running iOS 13 or [iPadOS 13](https://www.howtogeek.com/423446/ipados-will-almost-make-your-ipad-a-real-computer/) and higher.

There are two ways to do this. The first works without even opening the email. You can also mute a message from the reply menu.

If you’re in the Inbox, swipe left on an email and select the “More” option.

From the popup, tap on the “Mute” button.

The email will now have a small “Bell” icon to tell you that the thread has been muted.
