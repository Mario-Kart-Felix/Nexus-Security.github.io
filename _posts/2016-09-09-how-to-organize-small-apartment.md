You might be wondering how you could possible fit all your belongings into such a small space. Luckily, with some smart creative organizing, you can maximize the space available in your living area, closets, bedroom, and kitchen.

1.  Attach hooks to the wall in your entryway. Jackets, purses, and bags can take up a lot of space if they’re thrown around. By installing hooks just inside the front door, you’ll have a designated spot for these items. That way you and your guests can leave your jackets and bags here, freeing up space in the rest of the room.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   You could also use a standing coat rack for the same purpose. That way, you won’t have to worry about drilling holes in your wall.
    *   There are also sticky hooks you could use that attach to the wall without the need for screws or nails.
2.  Hang shoe organizers inside your closets to free up space. You might not realize that the inside of your closet doors have tons of space for storage. Hanging shoe organizers give you storage pockets for all your footwear that might otherwise clutter your floor or closet space.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

    *   Mount these organizers inside all your closets to get even more storage space.
    *   Remember, shoe organizers don’t have to only hold shoes. They’re great for storing all kinds of things that might be cluttering your home!
3.  Place space-saving corner shelves throughout your apartment. Maximize your storage room by using all of the corner space available in your apartment. Installing these shelves will give you more room for storage, or for displaying decorations to give your apartment some character.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

    *   You can either use shelves mounted to the wall, or get a few corner shelf stands.
4.  Use floor-to-ceiling bookcases to take advantage of vertical storage. In a small apartment, all your storage must be done vertically. Tall bookcases are a great investment because they take advantage of this and let you store items from your floor all the way up to your ceiling.[\[4\]](#_note-4)
    
    [![Organize a Small Apartment Step 4.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/40/Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-4.jpg/aid11277704-v4-728px-Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-4.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-4.jpg)
    
    *   Remember, bookcases aren’t just for books. They can store electronics, video games, file folders, or just about anything else that might otherwise end up in a drawer.
5.  Find a pop-up coffee table to maximize your space. This type of coffee table opens up to reveal storage space inside. Some types also extend, allowing multiple people to use a seemingly small table.[\[5\]](#_note-5)
    
    [![Organize a Small Apartment Step 5.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a6/Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-5.jpg/aid11277704-v4-728px-Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-5.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-5.jpg)
    
    *   You can also find a coffee table with drawers. This will still conceal storage space in a functional piece of furniture.
6.  Get rid of things you don’t need to prevent clutter. One of the keys to living in a small apartment is minimizing the amount of things you have to store. You might organize your apartment perfectly but still not have enough room. In this case, it’s time to take a look at what you own and decide what you can live without.[\[6\]](#_note-6)

    *   Remember to donate things that are still in good condition. Homeless shelters, veterans’ organizations, and other charities would love to have your old clothes and other items.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Organize-a-Small-Apartment&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Making Space in Your Bedroom")\]Making Space in Your Bedroom

1.  Get a bed with storage space. Some beds come with built-in storage space. This is a huge space saver in a small bedroom. If your bed has enough storage, you could avoid the need for a dresser or cabinet and increase your available floor space.[\[7\]](#_note-7)
    
    [![Organize a Small Apartment Step 7.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/da/Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-7.jpg/aid11277704-v4-728px-Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-7.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-7.jpg)
    
    *   Some bed designs have built-in drawers. You could use these as a replacement for a dresser.
    *   You could also invest in an Ottoman bed. With this design, the mattress lifts up to reveal storage space underneath. This space is perfect for clothes and linens.[\[8\]](#_note-8)
    *   If a bed with storage is out of your price range, you could also get a raised bed and use the space underneath to slide boxes.
2.  Consider a Murphy bed if you live in a studio apartment. Your bed could take up a lot of space in a studio apartment. Murphy beds are designed to fold up into a compartment that looks like an ordinary cabinet. This frees up the space the bed was using saves a lot of room in a studio apartment.[\[9\]](#_note-9)
    
    [![Organize a Small Apartment Step 8.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3f/Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-8.jpg/aid11277704-v4-728px-Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-8.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-8.jpg)
    
    *   Remember that Murphy beds can be expensive. Even cheaper models can be around $1,000. Consider your budget before making this investment.
3.  Mount shelves above your bed for additional storage and décor. There is plenty of space above your bed for one or more shelves, avoiding the need for night tables that take up room.[\[10\]](#_note-10)
    
    [![Organize a Small Apartment Step 9.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/73/Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-9.jpg/aid11277704-v4-728px-Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-9.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-9.jpg)
    
    *   Remember to test the height of any shelves you install above your bed. You should be able to sit up comfortably in bed without hitting your head, so make a mark on the wall where your head reaches up to.
    *   Make sure any shelves above your bed are installed properly and the items you place on them are secure. You don’t want anything falling on your while you sleep!
4.  Add a door hanger to your closet to free up closet space. You can maximize your closet space by installing a hanger rack on the inside of your closet door. This instantly doubles your space by allowing you to hang clothes on the normal closet rack and the door rack.[\[11\]](#_note-11)
    
    [![Organize a Small Apartment Step 10.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/29/Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-10.jpg/aid11277704-v4-728px-Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-10.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-10.jpg)
    
    *   There are several models of door hangers available. The simplest just hook over the top of the closet door, making installation and removal easy.
5.  Hang a full-length mirror on your door. A flat mirror can easily hook to the top of your bedroom door. This takes up very little space, and will make getting dressed a lot easier.[\[12\]](#_note-12)
    
    [![Organize a Small Apartment Step 11.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/be/Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-11.jpg/aid11277704-v4-728px-Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-11.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-11.jpg)
    
    *   The added bonus here is that mirrors help rooms look bigger. If you're feeling cramped in your tiny bedroom, this addition could do the trick.
    *   Hanging mirrors throughout your apartment could also make the rest of the space look bigger.
6.  Get a laundry hamper and keep your dirty laundry in it. In a small bedroom, dirty laundry will accumulate fast. Designate a space for your dirty clothes with a hamper in your bedroom. This will prevent you from leaving clothes on your floor.
    
    [![Organize a Small Apartment Step 12.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d7/Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-12.jpg/aid11277704-v4-728px-Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-12.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-12.jpg)
    
    *   Also remember to do your laundry often! Your hamper will fill up quickly and you don't want the clutter to overflow.
    *   Put your clean laundry away quickly too. Don't let a laundry basket take up your space.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Organize-a-Small-Apartment&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Maximizing Space in Your Kitchen")\]Maximizing Space in Your Kitchen

1.  Install wall hangers for your pots and pans. These take up a lot of space and you'll probably need your drawers and cabinets for storing utensils and cooking supplies. Take advantage of your kitchen's wall space by storing pots and pans vertically instead.[\[13\]](#_note-13)
    
    [![Organize a Small Apartment Step 13.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c9/Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-13.jpg/aid11277704-v4-728px-Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-13.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-13.jpg)
    
    *   You could use screws to hang these hooks, or if you’d rather not drill holes in your wall, there are hooks that use sticky backs to attach to the wall.
    *   The added bonus here is that your pots and pans will be easily-accessible, and you won't have to dig for them in a cabinet.
2.  Mount spice racks to the wall to save space. You’ll probably run out of drawer space quickly in a small kitchen. Spice racks on the wall will give you room to store all your ingredients and keep your drawers free for utensils.[\[14\]](#_note-14)
    
    [![Organize a Small Apartment Step 14.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/04/Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-14.jpg/aid11277704-v4-728px-Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-14.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-14.jpg)
    
    *   You probably have room for several spice racks, so feel free to install more than one for even more storage.
    *   You can also use spice racks to store other things like napkins, cups, or salt shakers.
3.  Use stackable shelves in your cabinets to stay organized. Cabinet space is precious in a small kitchen, so you have to make the most of what you have. By installing shelves in your cabinet, you can add two or even three rows of storage space that you didn't have before.[\[15\]](#_note-15)
    
    [![Organize a Small Apartment Step 15.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/01/Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-15.jpg/aid11277704-v4-728px-Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-15.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-15.jpg)
    
    *   When stacking items, remember to organize them by weight. Heavy items like a crock pot should be on the bottom, and lighter items should be on the top.
4.  Attach a folding table to your wall. If your kitchen or living area is too small for a table, there are models that hook to your wall and fold up. Like a Murphy bed, these tables free up space when not in use.[\[16\]](#_note-16)
    
    [![Organize a Small Apartment Step 16.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/16/Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-16.jpg/aid11277704-v4-728px-Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-16.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-16.jpg)
    
    *   Some folding table models also include even more storage space inside the cabinet that houses the table. You can use this to store away any glassware or silverware that you might not know what to do with.
    *   To further save space, consider pairing stackable chairs or stools with this table. Like the table, these can store away when not in use.
5.  Store items above your refrigerator. There is more room up there than you think! The unused space above your refrigerator can add some more storage or decoration to your kitchen. For example, you could install shelves there and store cups, dishes, or even cookbooks.[\[17\]](#_note-17)
    
    [![Organize a Small Apartment Step 17.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/65/Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-17.jpg/aid11277704-v4-728px-Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-17.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-17.jpg)
    
    *   A wine rack could also be a nice addition above your fridge.
6.  Utilize the space above your cabinets for storage. Rather than collecting dust, this area can maximize the storage in your kitchen.[\[18\]](#_note-18)
    
    [![Organize a Small Apartment Step 18.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a7/Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-18.jpg/aid11277704-v4-728px-Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-18.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Organize-a-Small-Apartment-Step-18.jpg)
    
    *   Extra pots and pans could fit nicely in this space. This would be convenient while you cook.
    *   If there is enough space, you might even be able to install more shelves up here. This can store more silverware, or you can use it as an overflow area for some of the things in the rest of your apartment.
    *   It's tempting to view these spaces as a junk area where you just throw things you don't need. Avoid that temptation! Keep these areas was well-organized as all your other spaces.
