Pumpkins are famous for being turned into jack-o'-lanterns, but this type of squash plant can also be used for making many delicious dishes. In order to do so, however, the skin must be peeled off. Pumpkins used for cooking, unlike those used for carving, have thicker skins that cover the fleshy fruit. Peeling the skin off is not a hassle with a vegetable peeler or sharp knife and a little dedication.

1.  Wash the pumpkin to remove dirt and contaminants and soften the skin. Remove dirt and other contaminants from the skin by washing the pumpkin under warm water. Removing dirt keeps the pumpkin from beginning to rot, and warm water soften the skin, making it easier to peel off. Dry the pumpkin with a clean towel or let it air dry.

2.  Cut the rounded top and bottom off of the pumpkin to create flat surfaces. Place the pumpkin on its side on a sturdy cutting board. Using a sharp kitchen knife, cut about off of the top and bottom of the pumpkin so that it has two flat sides.  
      
    *   The pumpkin should be able to steadily sit on its top and bottom after you make the cuts.
3.  Set up the pumpkin and the peeler. Turn the pumpkin on its side on a cutting board so that one flat side faces towards you and the other flat side is away from you. Place the peeler in one hand and use the other hand to hold the pumpkin steady while you peel.  
      
    
4.  Peel the skin using the peeler, starting from the side closest to you. Similar to [peeling a potato](https://www.wikihow.com/Peel-a-Potato "Peel a Potato"), push the peeler in a straight line, starting from the side closest to you and moving to the side farthest from you.[\[1\]](#_note-1)  
      
    *   You should aim to make peels that are about wide and are as long as the pumpkin's side.
    *   Try to only cut off the skin and leave the flesh intact. The skin is the outermost layer that covers the thicker flesh.
5.  Rotate the pumpkin to continue the peeling process. As you finish peeling sections, turn the pumpkin over to different sides.[\[2\]](#_note-2) Before continuing to peel on another side, remember to steady the pumpkin with your free hand.  
      
    
6.  Inspect the pumpkin and check to make sure all of the skin is peeled. You might have missed some spots as you were peeling. Rotate the pumpkin and check to see if you need to go back and peel places that you did not completely peel.

1.  Prepare the pumpkin for peeling. Wash the pumpkin off and let it dry. Cut off the top and bottom to create flat surfaces.  
      
    
2.  Place the pumpkin on its side and get your knife ready. Similar to using a vegetable peeler, you will want to place the pumpkin on a cutting board, with one of the flat surfaces facing towards your body. Hold the knife in your fist with the blade pointing outwards.[\[3\]](#_note-3)  
      
    
3.  Cut away strips of skin by pushing the knife along the side of the pumpkin. You should be able to see where the inner flesh of the pumpkin meets the outer skin. Push the blade of your knife down the pumpkin from the end closest to you towards the other end. As you finish sections, rotate the pumpkin until it is completely peeled.  
      
    *   Make sure to push the knife slowly and deliberately to protect your fingers from getting cut. Doing so also reduces the risk of cutting out the flesh.[\[4\]](#_note-4)
4.  Check to make sure all of the skin is peeled off. Rotate the pumpkin fully and see if there are any spots you missed before peeling them away.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Peel-a-Pumpkin&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Cooking the Pumpkin before Peeling")\]Cooking the Pumpkin before Peeling

1.  Prepare the pumpkin by washing and slicing it into smaller sections. Depending on how big your kitchen appliances are, cut the pumpkin into halves or into more sections. After doing so, use a large spoon to scoop out the seeds and other fibers from the pumpkin's inside and place them into a bowl.  
      
    *   The inner seeds of the pumpkin are edible and make for a yummy snack! You can save them for later or choose to roast them when you cook the pumpkin.[\[5\]](#_note-5)
2.  Bake the pumpkin in an oven. Pre-heat the oven to degrees. Place the pumpkin halves or sections onto a baking sheet. Once the oven warms up, put the pumpkin into it and cook for 15 to 45 minutes, depending on the sizes of the sections.[\[6\]](#_note-6)Check on the progress by sticking a fork into the flesh; when the fork easily punctures the flesh, take the pumpkin out and let it cool.

3.  Cook the pumpkin using a microwave. Place the sections of the pumpkin into a microwave-safe dish with a small amount of water.[\[7\]](#_note-7) Microwave the pumpkin for approximately 10 minutes, checking the progress using a fork. Once the pumpkin flesh can be easily punctured with a fork. Let the pumpkin out and let it cool.

    *   Depending on the microwave wattage and the size of the pumpkin slices, cooking time may vary. Keep an eye on it by checking on the pumpkin periodically as it cooks.
4.  Peel the pumpkin using the vegetable peeler method or the knife method. The skin should come off much more easily, but still be cautious when using sharp kitchen instruments.[\[8\]](#_note-8) Look over the pumpkin and peel away any spots you may have missed.
