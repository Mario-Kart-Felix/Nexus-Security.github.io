You can now download the Steam Link app for iOS and tvOS, allowing you to play Steam games on your iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV. Which is good news for anyone with a collection of Steam games and a desire to play them in bed. Which is surely everyone, right?

Apple Previously Rejected Steam Link
------------------------------------

In May 2018, Valve released [the Steam Link app for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.valvesoftware.steamlink). The company also tried to release the Steam Link app on iOS, but Apple rejected it because of alleged “business conflicts”. Valve appealed the decision, but Apple denied the appeal.

One year later, in May 2019, Valve and Apple resolved their differences. So the Steam Link app is now available on the App Store. It isn’t clear what prompted Apple’s change of heart, but it’s likely Valve changed the app in order to get it approved.

How to Play Steam Games on Your iPhone or iPad
----------------------------------------------

Steam Link is easy to download and install. And once set up, the Steam Link app lets you stream your collection of Steam games from your PC to other devices on the same network. And that includes Apple devices including the iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV.

As good as mobile games can be, they simply cannot compete with big-budget PC games in terms of storyline and scope. Which is what makes the idea of being able to play PC games on a smartphone or tablet such a compelling prospect.

There are some prerequisites. You’ll need to have a computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux) running Steam, an iPhone or iPad running iOS 10 or higher, and a fast and reliable internet connection. You’ll also want a Steam controller or MFI controller.

If you have all of those things—as well as an existing collection of Steam games ripe for playing on your mobile device—the Steam Link app is a worthy download. Especially if you want a break from having to sit at your PC to play video games.
