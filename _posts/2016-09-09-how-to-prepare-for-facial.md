Getting a facial is exciting, but it can be intimidating if you don’t feel confident about your skin. Many people wonder if you need to cram in some much-needed care for your face before the appointment. Preparing for a facial doesn’t have to be complicated though, since many estheticians actually prefer to see your skin exactly as it is on a regular day. Whether it’s your first time ever or you’re just seeing a new facialist, there are ways to show up ready to every appointment without having to change your routine.

1.  Avoid changing up your routine right before a facial. It’s important for your facialist to get a good look at how your skin is on a day-to-day basis. Some people try to add a bunch of new skincare products to their routine in the days before getting a facial, but this is counterproductive. For instance, if you don’t regularly use an exfoliator or a serum, don’t feel like you need to do so the night before your facial.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   If you are going to make any changes, you should actually do less than you are used to so that your esthetician has a more natural starting place.
2.  Pluck or shave any facial hair at least 24 hours before the facial. If you pluck or shave any part of your face, like your eyebrows, upper lip hair, or chin, it’s important to do that well before coming in for a facial. Otherwise, the treatments could irritate the tiny cuts and swollen hair follicles in your skin caused by hair removal.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

    *   If you are getting a procedure like waxing or eyebrow threading done, these should be scheduled for after your facial appointment.
3.  Work out before coming to the appointment, rather than after. If you have a regular workout scheduled in your day, arrange your schedule so that you can work out and rinse off in the shower before your facial. A heavy workout right after your appointment can irritate your freshly cared-for face with sweat and dirt.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

4.  Drink water and skip the caffeine to ensure you’re hydrated. It’s always a good idea to show up to a facial appointment well hydrated, which can be as simple as having water throughout the day before showing up. Especially if your appointment is in the morning, it’s important to stay away from caffeine so that you can be ready to relax.[\[4\]](#_note-4)

    *   Don’t drink so much that you feel like you might have to use the bathroom during your appointment. If you need to go, try to do it before the appointment starts.
5.  Bring your products into the appointment. On the day of your appointment, pack all the skincare products you typically use during the week and be prepared to show them to your facialist. This gives them an opportunity to understand how your face is treated, as well as look at the ingredients.

    *   Be prepared for some amount of critique. Unless you have a perfectly-researched and personally-tailored skin care regime, your esthetician will probably have some suggestions about products to use instead, ones to add, or ones to remove altogether.[\[5\]](#_note-5)
6.  Show up early to fill out the paperwork. Many facialists like to have you fill out forms about your skin, your skincare regimen, and your history with things like acne and eczema so that they can choose the right kinds of treatments for you. It’s also always a good idea to show up early to an appointment, even if there’s no paperwork to fill out.

    *   If you are rushing to get to an appointment, it might not be as relaxing as it could have been otherwise.

1.  Follow your estheticians instructions as closely as you can. The guidelines your facialist gives you are going to be the best practices for your face care. You will probably be given a number of recommendations for products to use, when to use them, and how much product to use. This will help you be your own facialist between sessions.[\[6\]](#_note-6)

    *   Ask any questions you might have while you are still at your facialist’s office, including ones about product recommendations.
    *   If you are afraid you’ll forget about a certain aspect of your esthetician’s facial care suggestions, you can ask them to write it down.
2.  Build your new routine into your old one. Once you’ve given some of the products a try, it’s important to incorporate your new routine into your usual daily habits. You should stop using products your facialist suggested you avoid and replace them with your new ones.[\[7\]](#_note-7)
    
    [![Prepare for a Facial Step 8.jpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/ca/Prepare-for-a-Facial-Step-8.jpeg/aid11369197-v4-728px-Prepare-for-a-Facial-Step-8.jpeg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Prepare-for-a-Facial-Step-8.jpeg)
    
    *   The new routine may be more time-intensive, but try to carve out time for them.
3.  Exfoliate once a week, starting a week after your facial. The glow from your facial will probably start to fade after around a week. If you want to keep it going strong, one of the best things you can do is use an exfoliating scrub or mask once a week before your next facial.[\[8\]](#_note-8)
    
    [![Prepare for a Facial Step 9.jpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/30/Prepare-for-a-Facial-Step-9.jpeg/aid11369197-v4-728px-Prepare-for-a-Facial-Step-9.jpeg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Prepare-for-a-Facial-Step-9.jpeg)
    
    *   If your facialist doesn’t give you a recommendation, you can ask while you’re there or call the office.
    *   This helps to slough off the dead skin that is covering up the nice your esthetician did during your appointment.
4.  Book an appointment around once a month. If you are looking to keep up your facial skincare regimen with regular trips to the salon, most estheticians suggest going in for a facial once a month, or every two months at most. This will help keep the procedure short and simple, without having to redo all of the work each time.[\[9\]](#_note-9)
