### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Getting the Bathtub Ready")\]Getting the Bathtub Ready

1.  Start with a [clean tub](https://www.wikihow.com/Clean-a-Bathtub "Clean a Bathtub") for the best experience. You won’t feel very relaxed if you get into a grimy tub. Even if your tub has been cleaned recently, take a moment to wipe it down with a damp towel to clear away any dust or hair that may have accumulated.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   It’s a good idea to wipe down the tub after you take a bath, too, so that there isn’t a build-up of soap scum over time.
2.  Fill the tub with hot water while you get the rest of your bath ready. Use water that is steamy and hot to the touch, but don’t get it so hot that you can’t hold your hand under the stream. Make sure to plug the tub’s drain![\[2\]](#_note-2)
    
    [![Prepare a Relaxing Bath Step 2 Version 7.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/33/Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-2-Version-7.jpg/aid9060-v4-728px-Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-2-Version-7.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-2-Version-7.jpg)
    
    *   You can always add more hot water while you’re in the tub if it needs a warm-up. or if you get lightheaded, get out and let the water cool down before you get back in.[\[3\]](#_note-3)}}
3.  Add some bubble bath or a bath bomb for some aromatherapy. You could make your own [bubble bath](https://www.wikihow.com/Take-a-Bubble-Bath "Take a Bubble Bath") or [bath bombs](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Bath-Bombs "Make Bath Bombs") or buy some from the store. Bubble bath gives you the experience of bathing in bubbles, which can be fun and relaxing, and bath bombs are famous for creating beautiful colors for you to enjoy in the tub.[\[4\]](#_note-4)
    
    [![Prepare a Relaxing Bath Step 3 Version 7.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9d/Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-3-Version-7.jpg/aid9060-v4-728px-Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-3-Version-7.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-3-Version-7.jpg)
    
    *   If you’re using bubble bath, pour about into the tub while the water is still filling up. The stream of water will help mix and distribute the bubbles.
4.  Use [essential oils](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Essential-Oils "Use Essential Oils") to relax your body or clear your sinuses. Combine 6-8 drops of essential oils to of carrier oil, like coconut or jojoba oil. After the water has finishing filling, add the mixture to the tub.[\[5\]](#_note-5)
    
    [![Prepare a Relaxing Bath Step 4 Version 7.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/02/Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-4-Version-7.jpg/aid9060-v4-728px-Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-4-Version-7.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-4-Version-7.jpg)
    
    *   Eucalyptus and peppermint are great if you have a stuffy nose.
    *   Lavender is a relaxing scent.
    *   Lemon and rosemary can boost your mood.
5.  Relax your muscles with [epsom salts](https://www.wikihow.com/Take-an-Epsom-Salt-Bath "Take an Epsom Salt Bath"). Use 2 cups (473 grams) of epsom salts in your bath. Pour the salts in while the water is filling up to help it dissolve a little faster. You can also stir the water with your hand to dissolve whatever remains. Soak in the tub for 15-20 minutes or more for the best results.[\[6\]](#_note-6)
    
    [![Prepare a Relaxing Bath Step 5 Version 7.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/fe/Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-5-Version-7.jpg/aid9060-v4-728px-Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-5-Version-7.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-5-Version-7.jpg)
    
    *   Your body will absorb the magnesium and sulfate from the salts, which can loosen your joints and relax your muscles.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Creating a Relaxing Atmosphere")\]Creating a Relaxing Atmosphere

1.  Create a [playlist](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-an-Awesome-Music-Playlist "Make an Awesome Music Playlist") filled with relaxing tunes to play during your bath. If you want to wind-down, avoid playing anything with a fast or heavy beat. Opt for instrumental or background music for a pleasant, calming effect.[\[7\]](#_note-7)
    
    [![Prepare a Relaxing Bath Step 6 Version 7.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/76/Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-6-Version-7.jpg/aid9060-v4-728px-Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-6-Version-7.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-6-Version-7.jpg)
    
    *   Many music-streaming services have pre-made playlists or stations specifically made for relaxation. Just search for “relaxing music” and see what pops up.
2.  Clear away [clutter](https://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Clutter-from-Your-Countertop "Clear Clutter from Your Countertop") so the space is visually appealing. Move dirty clothes, cosmetics, toys, and anything else that is taking up space on the bathroom counter. Put them away in drawers if needed, or set them out in the hall. The last thing you want is to look up from your bath and feel stressed about what needs to be cleaned up![\[8\]](#_note-8)
    
    [![Prepare a Relaxing Bath Step 7 Version 7.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/86/Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-7-Version-7.jpg/aid9060-v4-728px-Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-7-Version-7.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-7-Version-7.jpg)
    
    *   If you can, take 10-15 minutes to [clean your bathroom](https://www.wikihow.com/Clean-Your-Bathroom-Fast "Clean Your Bathroom Fast") before taking a bath. It might help you relax more easily.
3.  Use a bath caddy to keep your things dry. With a bath caddy, you’ll have space for a drink, snack, book, or anything else you’d like to have with you. Set up the caddy while the water is filling and put your things in place so that it’s ready to go once the bath is done.[\[9\]](#_note-9)
    
    [![Prepare a Relaxing Bath Step 8 Version 7.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/88/Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-8-Version-7.jpg/aid9060-v4-728px-Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-8-Version-7.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-8-Version-7.jpg)
    
    *   You can buy bath caddies that have props to hold up books or magazines, slots for the stems of wine glasses, and more.
4.  Dim the lights and light some candles for a relaxing aesthetic. Bright overhead lights could keep you from de-stressing, so opt to turn them down or completely off. Put candles on the countertops and around the edge of the tub if there is room.[\[10\]](#_note-10)
    
    [![Prepare a Relaxing Bath Step 9 Version 7.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/75/Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-9-Version-7.jpg/aid9060-v4-728px-Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-9-Version-7.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-9-Version-7.jpg)
    
    *   Use unscented candles if you are using essential oils or a scented bubble bath. If not, light one of your favorite scented candles to enjoy while in the tub.
    *   After your bath, double-check that all the flames have been extinguished.
5.  Tell your family that you’re not to be disturbed when you’re in the bath. If you live with other people and want to guarantee that you won’t be interrupted while you’re trying to relax, let them know ahead of time what your expectations are. If you have little kids, ask a partner or friend to watch them for 1/2 an hour so you can have some alone time.
    
    [![Prepare a Relaxing Bath Step 10 Version 7.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f3/Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-10-Version-7.jpg/aid9060-v4-728px-Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-10-Version-7.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-10-Version-7.jpg)
    
    *   If you have pets, you may want to keep the bathroom door shut during your bath. Otherwise, they might come in and beg for your attention and disturb the peace!

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Unwinding in the Bath")\]Unwinding in the Bath

1.  Give your skin some TLC with a [face mask](https://www.wikihow.com/Apply-Face-Masks-Correctly "Apply Face Masks Correctly") before you get in the tub. You can [make your own](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-All-Natural-Face-Masks "Make All Natural Face Masks") or buy a mask from the store. If you have long hair, pull it back so it doesn’t get in the way.[\[11\]](#_note-11)
    
    [![Prepare a Relaxing Bath Step 11 Version 7.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b8/Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-11-Version-7.jpg/aid9060-v4-728px-Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-11-Version-7.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-11-Version-7.jpg)
    
    *   Avocado, honey, olive oil, coconut oil, and even egg whites can be used to make a hydrating mask right in your own home.
2.  Enjoy a glass of [wine](https://www.wikihow.com/Drink-Wine "Drink Wine") and an indulgent snack while you soak. Take this opportunity to savor a special treat that you’ve been saving. While chocolates or candies are probably the most popular bath-time indulgence, you can choose anything you’d like! It’s probably best to avoid anything that might get crumbs in the bathwater, though.[\[12\]](#_note-12)
    
    [![Prepare a Relaxing Bath Step 12 Version 7.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/da/Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-12-Version-7.jpg/aid9060-v4-728px-Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-12-Version-7.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-12-Version-7.jpg)
    
    *   If you don’t drink wine, choose something else! Sparkling water can feel special and there are tons of great flavors to choose from. Even coffee or tea can be enjoyable as long as it doesn’t make you too hot.
3.  Read a good book or magazine for some indulgent me-time. Bring along the book you’ve been meaning to read forever or grab a fun magazine the next time you’re at the grocery store. Whatever you choose, enjoy taking some personal time to do something relaxing for yourself.[\[13\]](#_note-13)
    
    [![Prepare a Relaxing Bath Step 13 Version 7.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/10/Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-13-Version-7.jpg/aid9060-v4-728px-Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-13-Version-7.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-13-Version-7.jpg)
    
    *   Keep a towel nearby to dry off your hands so that the pages of the book or magazine don’t get wet.
4.  Use a [body scrub](https://www.wikihow.com/Do-a-Full-Body-Scrub "Do a Full Body Scrub") to exfoliate and soften your skin after a long day. Buy a scrub from the store or [make your own](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Body-Scrub "Make Body Scrub") at home. While you’re in the tub, scoop out about of the scrub and rub it over your arms and legs with a circular motion. Rinse off the scrub when you’re finished.[\[14\]](#_note-14)
    
    [![Prepare a Relaxing Bath Step 14 Version 7.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/25/Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-14-Version-7.jpg/aid9060-v4-728px-Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-14-Version-7.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-14-Version-7.jpg)
    
    *   You can use body scrub at any stage during your bath, but if you don’t like the idea of bathing in the rinsed-off scrub, just wait until you’re about to get out to do this.
5.  Dry off after your bath with a clean, [fluffy towel](https://www.wikihow.com/Get-Fluffy-Towels "Get Fluffy Towels"). Before you get into the bath, take a moment to pick out a clean towel from the cupboard and set it beside the tub. That way, you won’t have to use an old, damp towel from your morning’s shower.[\[15\]](#_note-15)
    
    [![Prepare a Relaxing Bath Step 15 Version 7.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/67/Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-15-Version-7.jpg/aid9060-v4-728px-Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-15-Version-7.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Prepare-a-Relaxing-Bath-Step-15-Version-7.jpg)
    
    *   Consider having a special towel that only you use for your relaxing baths. This will keep the towel in great condition and it’ll make your self-care time feel even more special.
