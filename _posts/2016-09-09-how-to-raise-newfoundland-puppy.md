Raising any type of dog from a puppy is a big responsibility, but Newfoundlands are also very big dogs. They require a greater quantity of food to grow to their full size, so feeding them is a little different from feeding other types of puppies. Keep your Newfoundland healthy as it grows with regular veterinary care and using other protective measures. And don’t forget to teach your dog good behaviors! This holistic approach will help you to raise your Newfoundland puppy into a healthy, happy adult dog and an outstanding canine citizen.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Feeding Your Newfoundland Puppy")\]Feeding Your Newfoundland Puppy

1.  Purchase puppy food for the first 18 to 24 months. Newfoundlands are a giant dog breed, which means they grow much faster and larger than other breeds. To ensure that your dog is getting adequate nutrients during this crucial growth period, [feed your Newfoundland](https://www.wikihow.com/Feed-Puppies "Feed Puppies") puppy food until it is at least 18 months old.[\[1\]](#_note-1)
    
    [![Raise a Newfoundland Puppy Step 1 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/ad/Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/aid6485556-v4-728px-Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy-Step-1-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy-Step-1-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   Ask your dog’s veterinarian or breeder for a food recommendation if you are not sure which type to buy. It is best to keep your puppy on the same food it was eating while living with the breeder, if possible. [Switching its food](https://www.wikihow.com/Switch-Dog-Foods-Gradually "Switch Dog Foods Gradually") can cause stomach issues.
    *   Look for a puppy food that’s labeled “large breed growth” so your Newfoundland gets the nutrients it needs. This helps it grow large and healthy bones.
    *   You may offer dry food only or a combination of wet and dry food.
2.  Determine your puppy’s daily food requirements. Newfoundland puppies need to eat about 2 cups (480 g) of dry food daily spread out over 3 feedings. You can find a daily intake recommendation on the package of your dog’s food. However, check with your puppy’s veterinarian for a specific recommendation if you are unsure.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

    *   Keep in mind that as your dog grows, it will require more food, such as up to 3 cups (720 g) of dry food daily when it reaches adulthood.
    *   Your dog’s daily food intake will change along with its weight, so it is important to keep regular veterinary appointments to track your puppy’s changing weight.
3.  Divide your puppy’s total daily food into 3-4 small meals daily. Puppies have smaller stomachs than adult dogs, so they cannot consume as much food as they need in a day at one time. Break your puppy’s total daily food intake into 3 servings and offer it at evenly spaced intervals throughout the day.[\[3\]](#_note-3)
    
    [![Raise a Newfoundland Puppy Step 3 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6c/Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy-Step-3-Version-3.jpg/aid6485556-v4-728px-Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy-Step-3-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy-Step-3-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   For example, if your puppy’s total daily intake should be 1.5 cups (360 g) of dry food, then break this into 3 half cup (120 g) servings that you offer every 5 hours during the day, such as at 7 am, 12 pm, and 5 pm.[\[4\]](#_note-4)
    *   As your puppy gets older, reduce how many meals it has throughout the day. After your puppy is 3 months old, only give it 3 meals a day. When it turns 6 months old, feed it 2 meals daily.
    *   Never exercise your puppy after it eats or else it can get bloat.
4.  Provide a large bowl of fresh, clean water at all times. Newfoundland puppies drink lots of water every day, so always make sure that your puppy has a bowl of fresh, clean water available. Place the bowl somewhere that is easy for your puppy to access, such as near its food bowl. This will also help to encourage your puppy to drink whenever it eats.[\[5\]](#_note-5)

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Keeping Your Puppy Healthy")\]Keeping Your Puppy Healthy

1.  Make your puppy an appointment with a veterinarian. The best way to ensure that your puppy will grow into a healthy adult dog is to take it to the veterinarian when you first get it. Then, return for additional checkups every 3 to 4 weeks until your puppy is 16 weeks old. This will help to ensure that your Newfoundland is growing at the desired rate and that there are no health issues that might threaten its life.[\[6\]](#_note-6)
    
    [![Raise a Newfoundland Puppy Step 5 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/36/Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid6485556-v4-728px-Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy-Step-5-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy-Step-5-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   During the first checkup, be sure to ask your veterinarian about vaccinations, deworming, heartworm prevention medication, and flea and tick control options. These are essential for protecting your Newfoundland from preventable diseases and parasites.
    *   You can have your Newfoundland spayed or neutered at 6 months, so be sure to ask about this as well.[\[7\]](#_note-7)
2.  [Puppy-proof your home](https://www.wikihow.com/Puppy-Proof-Your-Home "Puppy Proof Your Home") to protect your Newfoundland from hazards. Puppies like to chew on anything and everything, even items that are unsafe for them. Ideally, you should puppy-proof before bringing your Newfoundland home, but it's better late than never! Protecting your puppy from household hazards will help to prevent emergency trips, which can be very expensive.[\[8\]](#_note-8)
    
    [![Raise a Newfoundland Puppy Step 6 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c8/Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/aid6485556-v4-728px-Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy-Step-6-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy-Step-6-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   Keep wires hidden or up out of your puppy’s reach.
    *   Put cleaning chemicals and other hazardous solutions in locked cupboards.
    *   Pick up small, sharp items that your dog might swallow, such as safety pins, paper clips, bobby pins, and earrings.
    *   Place your garbage can and any cat litterboxes where your puppy cannot get at them, such as by using baby gates.[\[9\]](#_note-9)
3.  Set up a bed somewhere quiet and free from drafts. Your Newfoundland needs to be warm and comfortable while it sleeps, so choose a spot for its bed that is free from drafts. Avoid positioning its bed near windows or doorways.[\[10\]](#_note-10)
    
    [![Raise a Newfoundland Puppy Step 7 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c5/Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/aid6485556-v4-728px-Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy-Step-7-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy-Step-7-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   You can purchase a dog bed for your puppy, or use a few folded blankets as its bed.
    *   You may also consider getting a crate for your Newfoundland to provide it with a cozy den. Make sure to purchase a crate that is meant for giant breed dogs, which should be at least .[\[11\]](#_note-11)

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Teaching Your Puppy Good Behaviors")\]Teaching Your Puppy Good Behaviors

1.  Get some appropriate chew toys for your puppy. Newfoundlands love to chew, and you’re your puppy will chew on anything it can find. To prevent it from chewing on things it shouldn’t, purchase some good chew toys at your local pet store or online. Make sure to get the toys that are meant for big dogs.[\[12\]](#_note-12)
    
    [![Raise a Newfoundland Puppy Step 8.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b8/Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy-Step-8.jpg/aid6485556-v4-728px-Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy-Step-8.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy-Step-8.jpg)
    
    *   Check your puppy’s toys often to ensure that they are intact. If your puppy managed to bit a piece off of a toy, this may be a choking hazard. Retire the toy and get a new one.
2.  Reward your puppy for eliminating outside. Positive reinforcement is the best way to [house train your puppy](https://www.wikihow.com/House-Train-a-Puppy "House Train a Puppy"). Take your puppy outside once every 2 hours, and after eating, drinking, playing, or sleeping.[\[13\]](#_note-13) When you do this, give your puppy lots of praise and petting for going to the bathroom outside. Make a big deal of it to ensure that your puppy knows this is good behavior![\[14\]](#_note-14)
    
    [![Raise a Newfoundland Puppy Step 9.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/95/Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy-Step-9.jpg/aid6485556-v4-728px-Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy-Step-9.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy-Step-9.jpg)
    
    *   If your puppy has an accident in the house, never hit, scold, or otherwise punish the puppy. This will only teach the dog to fear you and it will not learn that it shouldn’t go to the bathroom inside. Instead, don’t say anything. Just clean up the mess right away and let your puppy out in case it has to go more.
    *   Use an enzymatic cleanser to clean up pet messes. This will help to ensure that your puppy does not go potty again in the same spot. You can find an enzymatic cleanser in a pet supply store.
3.  Introduce your puppy to a wide range of situations and people. Socializing your puppy will help to ensure that it grows into an even-tempered adult dog. From the time you get your puppy, take it outside on a leash for short walks, have different types of people over to meet your puppy, and bring your puppy along with you on errands to introduce it to lots of different sights and sounds.[\[15\]](#_note-15)
    
    [![Raise a Newfoundland Puppy Step 10.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9a/Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy-Step-10.jpg/aid6485556-v4-728px-Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy-Step-10.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Raise-a-Newfoundland-Puppy-Step-10.jpg)
    
    *   For example, take your puppy on a walk around your neighborhood each day so it can see the people, houses, and other sights.
    *   Take your puppy to the beach so it can see the water and walk on the sand, or visit the park with your puppy during an event so your puppy can get used to loud noises.
    *   You might also consider taking puppy class with your Newfoundland as a good way to expose it to different people and dogs. This is also a good way to teach your puppy some [basic commands](https://www.wikihow.com/Teach-Your-Dog-Basic-Commands "Teach Your Dog Basic Commands"), which will be useful as your dog grows into an adult.[\[16\]](#_note-16)
