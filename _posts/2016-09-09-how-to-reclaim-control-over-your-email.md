In the digital age, we’re receiving emails almost constantly, and at a certain point you just can’t keep up with deleting them all. Eventually, there’s a little red circle saying “1,506” over your email app icon and the thought of even beginning to clean your inbox is daunting. Fortunately, you don’t have to do it manually.
