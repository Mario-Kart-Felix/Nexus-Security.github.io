Duplicate contacts are bound to sneak into your address book no matter how carefully you manage it. And if removing duplicates on a frequent basis isn’t one of your virtues, chances are your contacts might already be cluttered. Unfortunately, managing iPhone/iPad contacts has always been like a pain in the back. But don’t worry, there is a workaround to nab all the redundant contact cards and wipe them out. As for macOS users, taking control of contacts is a bit convenient. So, if you have decided to clean up your address book, now is the perfect time to merge and remove duplicate contacts from iPhone, iPad, and Mac.  

Remove Duplicate Contacts from macOS, iOS, and iPadOS
-----------------------------------------------------

  

A little sneak-peek into the whole process so that you would already know what’s coming up:  

### So, What’s the Workaround?

  

On macOS, you can easily find out how many duplicate contacts you have. By duplicate I mean, the contacts which have either the same name but consist of different information or the same name and info. Once you have nabbed those unwanted contact cards, you can merge them all with just a click.  

Just in case you are using the same Apple ID on both macOS and iOS/iPadOS devices with the iCloud sync for Contacts enabled, the update will sync across the devices. Thus, your iPhone or iPad contacts will also be able to get rid of duplicates.  

*   _On macOS: **System Preferences > Apple ID > iCloud > Contacts. **_

What if you are not using macOS device, how would you clean up the duplicate contacts from your iPhone or iPad’s Contacts app? Well, you can use iCloud to get your work done. While it’s not straightforward, it just works fine in managing the address book ([and even recovering the lost ones](https://beebom.com/how-recover-deleted-icloud-contacts-calendars-bookmarks/)). With that said, let’s get going with the guide!

Merge iPhone and iPad Contacts Individually from Contacts App Itself
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  

Slightly buried inside the stock Contacts app for iPhone and iPad is an option to merge individual contacts. Though this native method would be rather tedious for merging hundreds of duplicates, it wouldn’t be too time-consuming for a few cards.  

1\. Open **Contacts** app and then find the contact you want to merge.

  
  

  

![Find Duplicate contacts](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Find-Duplicate-contacts-.jpg)

2\. Now, tap on **Edit** at the top right.  

![Tap-on-Edit-at-the-top-right-corner-blur](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Tap-on-Edit-at-the-top-right-corner-blur.jpg)

3\. Next, scroll down and tap on **link contacts.**

4\. Next up, **choose the contact** you want to merge with and then tap on **Link** at the top right. Finally, tap on **Done** to finish.

Third-Party Contact Manager Apps for iPhone and iPad to Merge and Remove Duplicate Contacts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

Luckily, App Store has a ton of contact manager apps that can help you find and delete duplicate contacts on your iPhone or iPad. The apps that I have tried and found quite reliable are as follows:  

1\. Duplicate Contacts Manager
------------------------------

  

It’s a pretty simple contact manager app that allows you to spot duplicate contacts with ease. Aside from allowing you to get rid of redundant contacts, it also lets you **[back up your address book](https://beebom.com/how-back-up-ios-devices-mac-running-macos-catalina/) and even restore it.** Moreover, it supports iOS 8 or later, allowing you to manage your contacts even on older iPhone and iPad models.

_**Price:** [Free](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/duplicate-contacts-manager/id1141369653)_  

2\. Contact Cleanup
-------------------

  

Contact Cleanup is yet another contact manager that I have found up to the task. Whether it’s nabbing all the duplicate contacts instantly or eliminating multiple unnecessary contact cards at one go, it does a reliable job. Moreover, it also allows you to **back up the entire address book so that all of your contacts will remain secure.** While this contact manager is free, you will need to spend $1.99 to merge all of your duplicate contacts automatically.

_**Price:** Free, $1.99 for the pro version _  

Remove Duplicate Contacts from Your iOS, iPadOS, and macOS
----------------------------------------------------------

  

So, that’s how you can merge and remove duplicate contacts from your iDevices. Though the above-explained methods work reliably, it would be better if Apple offered an easier native way to get rid of unwanted contact cards on the iPhone and iPad. As someone who has hundreds of contacts to manage, I wish to see this feature in iOS 14.
