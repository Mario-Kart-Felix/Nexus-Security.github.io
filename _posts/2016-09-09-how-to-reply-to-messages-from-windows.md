Microsoft is bringing some awesome changes to Windows 10 which allow you to respond to all sorts of messages from your PC. A few weeks ago, [we reported](https://beebom.com/windows-insiders-your-phone-reply-notifications/) that this feature is part of Windows Insider previews, but now it has been released for the stable build. If you are using the latest stable build of Windows 10, you can reply to messages from your Windows PC seamlessly. Further, you can also manage your photos and notifications without any issues. Now having said that, let’s go through the steps.

Before we begin the article, **make sure you are running the latest build of Windows 10**. Also, your smartphone must be on Android 7 (Nougat) or above version. With that said, here are the steps to follow.  

_**Note:** As of now, this feature is only available on Android._  

1\. First of all, **download and install Your Companion app** ([Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.appmanager&hl=en_IN)) from the Play Store on your Android device. After that, log in with your Microsoft account.
