While writing an article, I have to often [scale dozens of images to a specific size](https://beebom.com/free-batch-image-editors-windows-macos-linux/) for uploading. As it’s an integral part of my workflow, I wanted to make the whole process a little bit smoother and also less time-consuming. First, I was looking at some [third-party photo editing apps](https://beebom.com/photo-editing-apps-android/) but I was not that satisfied with the results. Finally, my [productivity-centric need](https://beebom.com/productivity-apps-mac/) led me to discover a quick way to resize images using Automator Quick Action on Mac. I am in love with this new hack and want to share it with you guys. So, if your workflow is akin to mine, this is how you can quickly resize images using Automator quick action on your Mac.  

Quickly Resize Images with Automator Quick Action on macOS
----------------------------------------------------------

  

Before diving straight into the whole process, let me briefly discuss the whole process and also spill some beans about the goodies that come attached with this Automator Quick Action.  

### Sneak-Peek into the Whole Process

  

As you may have already guessed it, we are first going to set up an image-resizing quick action using the Automator app. As it’s a stock app, you don’t have to take the pain of installing a third-party tool or even spending a few dollars. Talking about reliability, you can use this hack to resize a single or a bunch of images at once on your macOS device with just a couple of clicks. It works as smoothly as the [dark/light mode switch](https://beebom.com/how-quickly-switch-between-dark-light-mode-mac/) that we build using Automator. What’s more, there is also an option to assign a [keyboard shortcut](https://beebom.com/cool-mac-keyboard-shortcuts/) to it for a more simplified experience. As Automator has existed on Mac for years, you won’t face incompatibility issues either. So, what are you waiting for?  

### Creating Resize Image Automator Quick Action on macOS

  

1\. Open the **Automator** app on your Mac.
