Need a festive and healthy snack that’s crunchy and oh so tasty? Pumpkin seeds are perfect to chow on especially if you need to counter all the sweet treats you’ve been indulging in.

With just a few simple steps, you’ll learn how to take gooey wet pumpkin seeds, and turn them into a delicious crispy and salty snack.

The Healthier Side of Pumpkin
-----------------------------

Let’s face it; fall is officially here, which means we can enjoy all the sweet and decadent flavors this season brings. For you, that could mean pies or pastries and for others that could mean stealing your kid’s Halloween candy while they sleep—but pumpkin pies and handfuls of candy aren’t exactly the most diet-conscious snacks.

If you are hoping for something on the lighter side, why not try roasting pumpkin seeds. Pumpkin seeds have significant [health benefits](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/12163) because they contain magnesium, potassium, calcium, and so much more.

Although pumpkin seeds and pepitas are both technically seeds, we’ll talk about roasting the shelled seeds you would get in [a carving or sugar pumpkin](https://www.lifesavvy.com/9871/whats-the-difference-between-a-carving-pumpkin-and-a-pie-pumpkin/).

If you have plans for baking with pumpkin puree, then we recommend purchasing a sugar pumpkin because you’ll need it anyway.

Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Cut open your pumpkin and scoop out the seeds. Do your best to remove large parts of that orange goop.
