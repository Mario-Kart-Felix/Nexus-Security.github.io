Tamales are a traditional Mesoamerican dish made from [masa dough](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Masa "Make Masa") and steamed inside a corn husk or banana leaf. Although both methods taste delicious, they each require a bit of practice using your hands or a tortilla press. Luckily, the techniques are pretty simple and easy to learn!

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Roll-Tamales&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Using Corn Husks")\]Using Corn Husks

1.  Submerge your corn husks in hot water for 2 or more hours. Start by placing your husks into a baking dish or large bowl. Afterward, cover them with hot water and weigh them down with a bowl or plate so that they're completely submerged. Let them sit for 2 hours or until they are pliable.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   When your husks are done soaking you should be able to bend them without causing them to break or crack.
2.  Simmer hot water in your pot and steam basket. Place your steam basket into the pot and add water until it reaches the base of the steamer. Afterward, place a lid on the pot, put it on an element, and turn your stove dial to low heat until it simmers—you'll know it's simmering when the water starts to bubble slightly.[\[2\]](#_note-2)  
      
    *   If your bubbles are large and vigorous, the water is boiling—turn down the heat.
    *   Low heat is typically 2 to 3 on your stove dial.
3.  Drain your corn husks and dry them. Squeeze each husk gently to remove any excess water, which can make them sticky. Afterward, wipe each one dry with a clean paper towel.[\[3\]](#_note-3)  
      
    *   Always dry your husks before rolling them.
4.  Spread ¼ cup (32 grams) of masa dough over the husk with your hands. Place your drained corn husk onto a flat, clean area with the bottom—or wide edge—facing you. Now, spread your masa dough across the husk so that it's about thick, taking care to leave a border at the bottom.[\[4\]](#_note-4)  
      
    *   If you can't get all the masa dough across the husk, don't worry—focus on making sure it's thick.
    *   Always roll your tamales with the smooth side of the husk facing upward.
5.  Spread ¼ cup (32 grams) of masa dough over plastic with a tortilla press. Place a plastic tortilla bag onto your open tortilla press. Start by rolling your masa dough into a small, compact ball. Now, place the ball into your plastic tortilla bag so that one piece of plastic runs across the top and the other runs underneath it. Afterward, bring the top plate of the press onto the top of your dough and then press the handle overtop the plate while applying downward pressure. Finally, open the press, remove the plastic lining, and place your dough onto your corn husk.[\[5\]](#_note-5)  
      
    *   Pat down the ball firmly with your middle, index, and ring finger before pressing it for better results.
    *   Make sure your tortilla is about thick.
    *   Leave a border between the bottom of the husk and the dough.
6.  Spread 1 tablespoon (14.8 grams) of filling through the center of the dough. Scoop your choice of filling into the center of the tamale. Now, use the back of the spoon to spread it in a vertical line down the center of your dough.[\[6\]](#_note-6)  
      
    *   Common tamale filling includes beef, green chile, Yucatan, Mexico del Sur, black bean and cheese, and seafood.
7.  Pull the corn husk together until the dough meets. Hold each side of the corn husk so that your hands are parallel and the dough is a vertical line directly in front of you. Now, bring both sides of the husk together until the dough touches as it hovers over the filling.[\[7\]](#_note-7)  
      
    *   Use your fingers to press the dough together from underneath the corn husk.
8.  Wrap the dough firmly in the husk. Start with the left or right side and then continue with the other. Take care to avoid getting any piece of the husk stuck between the dough and filling.[\[8\]](#_note-8)  
      
    *   Don't wrap the dough too tightly or you'll ruin the tamale's shape.
9.  Close the top of the husk onto itself. The top of the husk is the empty, tapered side—fold this portion over the part of the husk that holds your tamale. For smaller tamales or those that aren't staying closed, tie them off with butcher's twine.[\[9\]](#_note-9)  
      
    *   Repeat this process for each tamale.
10.  Freeze your tamales or steam them for 2 hours. If you're not ready to eat your tamales, place them in the freezer. If you're ready to eat them, place them into a covered pot of steaming water for about 2 hours and enjoy![\[10\]](#_note-10)  
      
    *   Tamales are ready to eat when the dough sets and they can easily be pulled from the husks.
    *   Cool your tamales for 15 minutes before eating them.
    *   To eat them later, store tamales in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days or the freezer for 3 to 4 weeks.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Roll-Tamales&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Using Banana Leaves")\]Using Banana Leaves

1.  Cut your banana leaves into pieces. Start by rinsing your leaves with cold water to clean them. Afterward, remove the stems from each leaf. Now, cut or tear them into square pieces. Take care to keep the edges as straight as possible when cutting or tearing them.[\[11\]](#_note-11)  
      
    
    [![Roll Tamales Step 11.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/fc/Roll-Tamales-Step-11.jpg/aid10758050-v4-728px-Roll-Tamales-Step-11.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Roll-Tamales-Step-11.jpg)
    
    *   Use a clean pair of scissors to cut your leaves if you don't want to tear them into pieces with your hands.
2.  Pass your banana leaves over a stove burner to decrease their stiffness. Turn your gas or electric stove burner to low heat—2 to 3 on the dial—and hold the leaves over the flame until they soften. You should see the color change from a drab color to shiny, which is a sign that the waxes are melting off the leaf.[\[12\]](#_note-12)  
      
    
    [![Roll Tamales Step 12.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/cb/Roll-Tamales-Step-12.jpg/aid10758050-v4-728px-Roll-Tamales-Step-12.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Roll-Tamales-Step-12.jpg)
    
    *   Don't heat your leaves too much—keep them about above the burner.
3.  Add ¼ cup (32 grams) of filling onto the banana leaf. After adding your filling, pat it down with your fingers into an oblong strip approximately halfway up the leaf and to the right.  
      
    *   Keep about between the right side of the filling and the right side of the leaf.
4.  Add 2 tablespoons (14.40 grams) of beans and 1 strip of cheese to half of the leaf. Use your spoon to flatten out your beans and cheese and press them to one side of the leaf. For the best results, press them toward the half to the left.[\[13\]](#_note-13)  
      
    *   Skip the cheese if you're not a fan of dairy.
5.  Roll your banana leaf into a vertical tube over your filling. Start by using your right hand to hold the banana leaf vertically and fold it over the tamale. Keep this part pressed down and fold the other side over the top. Now, fold the bottom up and the top down and tie the leaf closed with a small strip of banana leaf.[\[14\]](#_note-14)  
      
    *   Don't worry too much about the shape of your tamale—as long as it's sealed and closed, you're good to go!
6.  Steam your tamales for 75 minutes and serve them. Add a bit of tomatillo salsa for a great taste! Just be sure to give your tamales about 10 minutes to cool prior to serving.[\[15\]](#_note-15)  
      
    *   Store your tamales in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days or in the freezer for 3 to 4 weeks.
