    [![Run the NYC Marathon Step 12.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/1b/Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-12.jpg/aid9739590-v4-728px-Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-12.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-12.jpg)

    [![Run the NYC Marathon Step 13.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0a/Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-13.jpg/aid9739590-v4-728px-Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-13.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-13.jpg)
    
    *   Some good foods for carbohydrate loading are sweet potatoes, brown rice, and quinoa.[\[16\]](#_note-16)
    *   Do not overload on carbohydrates. This will make you bloated and lethargic on race day.
3.  Pack your race gear in your carry on luggage. If you are flying to NYC for the marathon, make sure to keep everything you need for race day in your carry on bag, including clothes, shoes, band aids, nutritional products, and energy gels.[\[17\]](#_note-17)
    
    [![Run the NYC Marathon Step 14.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9c/Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-14.jpg/aid9739590-v4-728px-Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-14.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-14.jpg)
    
    *   You do not want to be scrambling for new gear if your checked bag is lost.
4.  Consume simple meals in the days leading up to the race. Cut foods like red meat, nuts, dairy, fried food, and roughage out of your diet the day before the marathon. Also try to avoid high fiber foods.[\[18\]](#_note-18)
    
    [![Run the NYC Marathon Step 15.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9e/Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-15.jpg/aid9739590-v4-728px-Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-15.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-15.jpg)

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Run-the-NYC-Marathon&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Running on Marathon Day")\]Running on Marathon Day

1.  Look up the weather forecast and prepare accordingly. Wearing the appropriate clothing is essential when running in any type of weather. Make sure your layers are comfortable and able to be discarded along your route. You do not want to have to carry a sweatshirt for the entire race.
    
    [![Run the NYC Marathon Step 17.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2a/Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-17.jpg/aid9739590-v4-728px-Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-17.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-17.jpg)
    
    *   If rain is in the forecast, bring a trash bag with a hole cut out for your head and wear it while waiting in the corral. Take it off before starting the race.[\[20\]](#_note-20)
    *   If it is a cold rain, rub petroleum jelly on your arms and legs to keep warm. Do not rub jelly on your head or neck as it does not allow for adequate sweating and you may overheat.[\[21\]](#_note-21)
    *   If the weather is supposed to be hot, try to drink cold fluids (such as a slushie) before the race.[\[22\]](#_note-22)
    *   The New York Road Runner club collects discarded clothing and donates them to charity.[\[23\]](#_note-23)
2.  Bring only what you need to the race. It is important to not be weighed down with unnecessary baggage. Make sure your phone is secure and not in your way.
    
    [![Run the NYC Marathon Step 18.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/30/Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-18.jpg/aid9739590-v4-728px-Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-18.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-18.jpg)
    
    *   Some essentials include your photo ID, some cash, and a small snack.[\[24\]](#_note-24)
3.  Keep your pace steady for the first couple of miles. The first section is uphill, and many people try to overexert themselves. Don’t waste energy trying to swerve around other runners during the first .[\[25\]](#_note-25)
    
    [![Run the NYC Marathon Step 19.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4e/Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-19.jpg/aid9739590-v4-728px-Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-19.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-19.jpg)
    
4.  Stay hydrated along the marathon route. Slow down, but don’t stop, at aid stations. Stopping will shorten your muscles and cause cramping.[\[26\]](#_note-26)
    
    [![Run the NYC Marathon Step 20.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/aa/Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-20.jpg/aid9739590-v4-728px-Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-20.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-20.jpg)
    
    *   Squeeze the cups to avoid spilling.
    *   Keep your core cool by dumping some water on your head and neck during the race.
5.  Focus on your music or inner mantra during the race. The noise of the crowds may cause you to speed up too early and leave you with no energy for the end of the marathon.[\[27\]](#_note-27)
    
    [![Run the NYC Marathon Step 21.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f1/Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-21.jpg/aid9739590-v4-728px-Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-21.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-21.jpg)
    
    *   Make a playlist that will help keep your energy up during the marathon.[\[28\]](#_note-28)
    *   Examples of positive mantras are “I am strong and feel good” and “I am running great”.[\[29\]](#_note-29)
6.  Look at a runner in front of you and focus on the back of their shirt. Act like you are a fisher reeling in the person in front of you. Once you pass that runner, repeat the process.[\[30\]](#_note-30) Keep going and remain motivated throughout the race.
    
    [![Run the NYC Marathon Step 22.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/72/Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-22.jpg/aid9739590-v4-728px-Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-22.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-22.jpg)
    
    *   Be prepared for the hilly last . This is where many racers run out of steam.[\[31\]](#_note-31)
7.  Cross the finish line and celebrate your accomplishment. Once you have crossed the finish line, it is important to stretch. Taking a long walk after the race will help flush the lactic acid out of your body and bring you gradually back to your resting state.[\[32\]](#_note-32)
    
    [![Run the NYC Marathon Step 23.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b0/Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-23.jpg/aid9739590-v4-728px-Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-23.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Run-the-NYC-Marathon-Step-23.jpg)
    
    *   Eat a big, hearty meal afterwards to replenish the nutrients your body lost while running.[\[33\]](#_note-33)

\[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Run-the-NYC-Marathon&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Tips")\]Tips
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
