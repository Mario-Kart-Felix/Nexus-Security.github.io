1.  Drive the speed limit to eliminate excess drag. As cars increase in speed, wind drag makes the engine work harder to keep the car moving. This burns fuel at a much higher rate. Keep your speed at the posted limit or just below it for the best performance.[\[1\]](#_note-1)
    
    [![Save Gas when You're Driving Step 1.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0a/Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-1.jpg/aid11633738-v4-728px-Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-1.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-1.jpg)
    
    *   While all vehicles hit their peak MPG at different speeds, generally, cars are most fuel-efficient at around per hour. Going faster than that reduces fuel efficiency.[\[2\]](#_note-2)
    *   If the posted speed limit is higher than this, drive in the right lane so other motorists can pass you.
    *   Speeding is also a safety and legal violation, so there are many other reasons to travel at the speed limit.
2.  Press the gas and brake pedals smoothly to avoid stop and go driving. Stop and go driving is the most inefficient way to drive a car. Even with traffic and traffic lights, you can drive in a way that reduces stop and go travel. Always work the pedals smoothly, without slamming either one. Press the brakes smoothly to avoid a jerky stop, and accelerate back up with steady pressure on the gas pedal. This increases your fuel efficiency.[\[3\]](#_note-3)
    
    [![Save Gas when You're Driving Step 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/54/Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-2.jpg/aid11633738-v4-728px-Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-2.jpg)
    
    *   Follow other cars at a safe distance to avoid slamming the brakes if they stop short.
    *   If you want to speed up or pass another driver, don’t pump the gas pedal hard. Increase the pressure gradually to bring yourself to a higher speed.
    *   In an emergency, however, don’t hesitate to hit the brakes hard if you have to stop.
3.  Release the gas pedal and coast before braking. Suddenly applying the brakes cuts down on your fuel efficiency. If you know you have to stop, plan ahead. Release the gas pedal without hitting the brakes yet and coast until the car slows down. Then apply the brakes. Since the car is moving slower, you won’t burn as much fuel trying to stop.[\[4\]](#_note-4)
    
    [![Save Gas when You're Driving Step 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/bc/Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-3.jpg/aid11633738-v4-728px-Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-3.jpg)
    
    *   This technique works especially well with traffic lights. Once you see that a light turns yellow and you know you won’t make it, let the gas pedal go. By the time you have to stop, your car will be moving much slower.
    *   Again, don’t do this in an emergency. Press the brakes as hard as is necessary to avoid hitting something.
4.  Go up hills slowly to conserve energy. While it may sound counterproductive, going slower uphill burns less fuel than going fast. The engine works harder and burns more fuel if you try to maintain your speed going uphill. Don't try to maintain your speed when passing over hills. Instead, keep your pedal pressure consistent and let the hill slow you down. You'll regain speed once you get to the top.[\[5\]](#_note-5)
    
    [![Save Gas when You're Driving Step 4.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a3/Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-4.jpg/aid11633738-v4-728px-Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-4.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-4.jpg)
    
    *   Check behind you before driving like this. If someone is tailgating you, they could hit you if they aren't paying attention.
5.  Coast downhill while keeping the car in gear. While some people switch into neutral to coast downhill, this practice actually burns more fuel. Instead, simply let go of the gas pedal and let the car coast downhill while keeping the car in gear. This way, the engine won't be working and burning fuel.[\[6\]](#_note-6)
    
    [![Save Gas when You're Driving Step 5.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c0/Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-5.jpg/aid11633738-v4-728px-Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-5.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-5.jpg)
    
    *   Keep your foot hovering over the brake pedal while coasting just in case you have to stop suddenly.
    *   Switching into neutral while moving is also potentially dangerous. It gives you less control over the car and your engine could overheat if you have to hit the brakes.

1.  Use [cruise control](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Cruise-Control-on-a-Car "Use Cruise Control on a Car") to save fuel on long drives. Studies show that switching into cruise control on long drives is more fuel efficient because it keeps your car at a steady speed. If you’re traveling on the highway and there is no traffic, switch your car into cruise control to get the max fuel efficiency.[\[7\]](#_note-7)
    
    [![Save Gas when You're Driving Step 6.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6b/Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-6.jpg/aid11633738-v4-728px-Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-6.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-6.jpg)
    
    *   Pay careful attention to the road while you’re using cruise control. Don’t tune out.
    *   Don’t use cruise control in bad road conditions.
2.  Turn off the engine if you’re idling for more than 60 seconds. Idling burns fuel very inefficiently. If you’re idling and know you’ll be there for more than 60 seconds, then turn off the engine and restart it when you have to move again.[\[8\]](#_note-8)
    
    [![Save Gas when You're Driving Step 7.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c7/Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-7.jpg/aid11633738-v4-728px-Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-7.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-7.jpg)
    
    *   The best situations to use this technique are ones in which you know you'll be idling in one place for a while, such as parked at a curb, waiting at a railroad crossing, or in a busy drive-thru. It’s not the best idea in traffic, unless there is a major delay and nothing is moving.
    *   If you’re idling for less than 60 seconds, however, leave the car running. You’ll burn more fuel turning the engine back on than you’ll save by turning it off.
3.  Close your windows if you’re driving faster than per hour. At highway speeds, the increased wind resistance makes your car work much harder. Close the windows and use the car's AC system if you’re traveling greater than to get better fuel efficiency.[\[9\]](#_note-9)
    
    [![Save Gas when You're Driving Step 8.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2e/Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-8.jpg/aid11633738-v4-728px-Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-8.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-8.jpg)
    
    *   There is a long debate about whether using your air conditioner or opening your windows is more fuel-efficient. The answer is to open the windows and turn off the AC at speeds below . Faster than this, close the windows and turn on the AC.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Planning Ahead")\]Planning Ahead

1.  Remove unnecessary weight from the car. Increased weight means that the car's engine needs to work harder to bring you up to speed, meaning it burns more fuel. Make your car more fuel-efficient by taking out any excess boxes or equipment you don't use. Each pound you remove lets your car work more smoothly.[\[10\]](#_note-10)
    
    [![Save Gas when You're Driving Step 9.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4b/Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-9.jpg/aid11633738-v4-728px-Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-9.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-9.jpg)
    
    *   Attachments like hitches and roof racks also add weight. If you aren't hauling something on this trip, take them off to save fuel.
2.  Take a route with the least amount of traffic and stops. If there are multiple ways to get somewhere, take the amount of stopping into account. A road with lots of traffic lights might make you stop and idle often. Similarly, roads that are prone to traffic will slow you down. Listen to traffic reports and pick the clearest routes to maximize your fuel efficiency.[\[11\]](#_note-11)
    
    [![Save Gas when You're Driving Step 10.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/02/Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-10.jpg/aid11633738-v4-728px-Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-10.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-10.jpg)
    
    *   The best route will probably change depending on the time of day. Monitor traffic reports to find the best option.
    *   Apps like Google Maps or Waze calculate the shortest routes for your trip by taking traffic into account. Listen to these calculations to find the smoothest rides.
3.  Travel outside the high-traffic periods of the day if possible. This may not be possible if you commute to and from work in rush hour. However, if you work on a different schedule, then avoid running your errands at high-traffic times. Cover all your driving needs in the middle of the day or in the evening after the commute.[\[12\]](#_note-12)
    
    [![Save Gas when You're Driving Step 11.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b6/Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-11.jpg/aid11633738-v4-728px-Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-11.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-11.jpg)
    
    *   Keep this in mind if you’re leaving for a trip as well. Leave before the morning rush to avoid slowdowns and conserve your fuel.
4.  Combine multiple errands into one trip to reduce travel time. Going home between each errand increases the number of trips you have to make and the distance you have to drive. Plan ahead and list all the places you have to go to. If possible, tackle all your errands in one trip for the most fuel efficiency.[\[13\]](#_note-13)
    
    [![Save Gas when You're Driving Step 12.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e7/Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-12.jpg/aid11633738-v4-728px-Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-12.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Save-Gas-when-You%27re-Driving-Step-12.jpg)
    
    *   For example, if you have to go food shopping, to the post office, and get a haircut one day, don’t go home in between each errand. Do them all in the same trip to reduce the amount of driving you have to do.
    *   Also try to group errands by which ones are close together. If the supermarket and post office are both on one side of town and the barber is on the other, then go to the supermarket and post office first.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Keeping your tires in good condition is one of the biggest ways to increase fuel efficiency. Fill them to the recommended psi for the best results.
*   Unless it’s below zero outside, only warm up your car for 30-60 seconds. The engine will warm up as you drive, so go slowly for the first few minutes of driving.
