It’s handy to save websites and articles as PDFs so you can read them later. Here’s how you can quickly generate a PDF on your iPhone or iPad, and then save it with a service like [Pocket](https://www.howtogeek.com/260850/how-to-save-articles-for-reading-later-with-pocket/).

How to Save a Full-Page Screenshot as a PDF
-------------------------------------------

In [iOS 13](https://www.howtogeek.com/440039/the-best-new-features-in-ios-13/), iPadOS 13, and newer, you can take a full-page screenshot of a website in Safari and save it as a PDF in the Files app.

There are two notable points about this new method:

1.  The PDF generates as one continuous page without any page breaks.
2.  Instead of a regular PDF, with an A4 page width, the PDF is the same width as the iPhone or iPad on which you’re viewing it.

If you want to generate a cleaner PDF of the page—without the ads and formatting—switch to [Reader Mode](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/25072/how-to-use-and-tweak-reader-mode-in-safari/) first. To do this, tap and hold “AA” in the upper-left corner, and then tap it again to customize the text layout.

Open the website on your iPhone or iPad and [take a screenshot](https://www.howtogeek.com/288628/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-your-iphone-or-ipad/). If you have an iPhone X-style device with a notch, or an iPad Pro with Face ID, press and hold the “Side” and “Volume Up” buttons together until you see the screenshot animation.

If you’re using an iPhone or iPad with a Home button, press it, along with the “Power/Sleep” button to take a screenshot.

You see a little screenshot preview in the bottom-left corner—tap it.
