Slowly but steadily Files app (first introduced in 2017 along with iOS 11) has become a proficient file manager. While it may not yet be as versatile as macOS Finder, it is far better than the [well-known third-party offerings](https://beebom.com/best-file-managers-iphone/) like Documents by Readdle and FileApp. It’s more than a handy app to simplify file management and now that iOS 13 is bringing the support for external drives, Files app has become essential for many users. Apart from supporting external drives, the latest iteration of iOS is also adding a native document scanning tool to the Files app. So, going forward, you can scan documents directly from the Files app on your iOS 13 and iPadOS devices.  

Scan Documents Using Files App on iPhone and iPad
-------------------------------------------------

  

It’s worth mentioning that Apple’s Notes app had already got the document scanning tool in iOS 11. Thus, its arrival in the Files app , which is often touted as the Finder for iPad and iPhone, was on the expected line. Apart from supporting both auto and manual scanning, the app provides multiple options to fine-tune colors and even adjust the end result before saving the doc as PDF. Having said that, let’s find out how document scanning works in the Files app!  

1\. Open the **Files app** on your iPhone or iPad and ensure than the **Browse tab** is selected. After that, head over to the **location** where you want to save _your scans and then **swipe down on the screen**. Next, tap on the **three dots (ellipsis button)** at the top left corner of the screen and choose **Scan Documents** in the pop-up menu. _
