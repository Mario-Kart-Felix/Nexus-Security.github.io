Three Methods:[Using Google Image Search](https://www.wikihow.com/Search-and-Find-About-Someone-Using-Image-Easily#Using_Google_Image_Search_sub)[Using TinEye](https://www.wikihow.com/Search-and-Find-About-Someone-Using-Image-Easily#Using_TinEye_sub)[Using a Mobile Device](https://www.wikihow.com/Search-and-Find-About-Someone-Using-Image-Easily#Using_a_Mobile_Device_sub)[Community Q&A](https://www.wikihow.com/Search-and-Find-About-Someone-Using-Image-Easily#Questions_and_Answers_sub)

Have a picture of someone, but don't know who it is, or what the picture means? You can use various image searching tools online to find other copies of the image, track down the origin, and discover more information. Google Images and TinEye are the most popular options, and you can even do it from your mobile device.

Using Google Image Search

    **Find the image that you want to search with.** You can use Google to search by image instead of text. Google will attempt to find other copies of the same image on the internet, as well as provide visually similar images. This can help you determine where the picture originated from, and potentially find more pictures of the same person. You can search from images that have been saved to your computer, or you can search using the image's URL.
    
    *   To find an image's address, right-click on it and select "Copy image address/URL."
    *   To save an image to your computer, right-click on it and select "Save image."
    *   If you're using a mobile device, click here instead.

Tips

*   TinEye is great for checking to see if someone who is claiming an image is an original image of them actually is! Put in the image details of anyone you know on line, even wikiHow profile pictures, and see how many other times 'their picture' has been used on line.
