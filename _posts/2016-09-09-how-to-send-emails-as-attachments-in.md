[Google](https://beebom.com/google-page/) introduced the ability to send emails as attachments in Gmail earlier this week. With this new implementation, users will be able to seamlessly attach emails inside emails without spamming the inbox of the recipient with a dozen of follow-up emails.  

_“Sending emails as attachments allows you to write a summary email message to your recipients, and attach the set of supporting emails that recipients can directly open in their mail client.”,_ wrote the software giant in a [blog post](https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2019/12/forward-emails-as-attachments.html).

3\. The selected emails will now appear as attachments on the compose window, just like how it looks after you attach files on emails. Alternatively, you can select the emails and click on “**Forward as attachment**” option that appears when you click the vertical three dots icon.
