Spending way too much time on your Android device? Use a digital wellbeing app to track your app usage and set app limits. Want some peace of mind? Block specific apps for a bit with Focus mode.

How to Set An App Timer in Android 9 and Higher
-----------------------------------------------

Digital Wellbeing is Google’s screen time management feature. It’s available on [Google Pixel phones](https://www.howtogeek.com/336133/if-you-want-android-just-buy-googles-pixel-phone/), Android One devices (that run Android 9 Pie and higher), and a limited number of other phones. After you download the [Digital Wellbeing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.wellbeing&hl=en_US) app on your device, it shows up as a Settings item.

The Digital Wellbeing app monitors how much time you spend on your phone. It tells you how many times you’ve picked up your phone, how much time you’ve spent in a specific app, and how many notifications you’ve received today.

You can use this information to make decisions about how much time you spend on your smartphone. The app also gives you tools, like App Timer, to curb your usage.

With App Timer, you can restrict how much time you can spend in an app. For example, you can set it up so you only use YouTube 30 minutes per day.

To do this, either swipe down on the notification shade, and then tap the gear icon to open Settings (or open it from the app drawer). Next, tap “Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls.”

In the Dashboard, scroll down to the YouTube app and tap the hourglass icon next to it.
