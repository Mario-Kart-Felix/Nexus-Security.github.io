It’s not always convenient to read text messages on your Android phone, especially if you’re driving. Rather than risk trouble with the law, you can use Android’s built-in features that read texts aloud.

These features can also benefit people with poor eyesight, or those who want to reduce their screen time. There are also third-party apps that read your texts to you.

Let’s look at all the options, and how you can get set up.

How to Install Google Assistant on Your Phone
---------------------------------------------

[Google Assistant](https://www.howtogeek.com/336212/the-best-things-google-assistant-can-do-on-your-android-phone/) is built-in on most modern Android smartphones, and you can set it up to read your text messages aloud.

If you don’t have [Google Assistant](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.googleassistant) on your phone, you can install it. The app is linked to your Google account. After you install it, you can use it for everything from finding the latest weather forecast and controlling smart devices, to reading and responding to messages.

After you install Google Assistant, there are several ways you can activate it. You can just say, “OK, Google,” or “Hey, Google,” to get started. Alternatively, tap the Google app (if it’s preinstalled on your device) or Google Assistant, and then tap the microphone icon.

On some devices, you can also hold down the home button for a few seconds to access the Assistant.
