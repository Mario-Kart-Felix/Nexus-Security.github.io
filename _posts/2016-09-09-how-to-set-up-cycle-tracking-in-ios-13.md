Apple Watch has continued to push the boundaries for health and fitness. While the rest of the industry still seems to be struggling to find a foothold, Apple’s smartwatch is dominating the market. One of the major reasons why the smartwatch has become such a big hit is the much-improved watchOS that packs a range of health-centric features like the newly launched Cycle Tracking feature. For those unfamiliar, it’s a women’s health tracking feature that makes it pretty easy to track the menstruation cycle and fertility window from Apple Watch and the companion iPhone. In this article, I walk you through the quick steps to set up and use Cycle Tracking in iOS 13 and watchOS 6.  

Complete Guide: Use Cycle Tracking in watchOS 6 and iOS 13
----------------------------------------------------------

  

Apart from letting you keep a track of your monthly cycle data, Cycle Tracking also allows you to monitor your daily symptoms and monthly activity either from the Health app or the standalone Cycle Tracking app from Apple Watch. Based on the data you have entered, it also offers period and fertility window predictions so that you can stay in the loop and plan accordingly.  

Thanks to the seamless integration, all the data from iPhone’s Health app is synced with Apple Watch. Hence, you get timely alerts about fertility days, next period, log symptoms and more. Even better, you also have a ton of customization to make cycle tracking a lot straightforward and personalized. That said, let’s get going!  

1\. To get started, launch the **Health app** on your iPhone and tap on the **Browse** tab at the bottom.

That’s it! You have successfully set up cycle tracking. Now, the Health app will create a custom prediction and fertility calendar so that you can easily keep a track of the menstrual cycle.  

Customize Cycle Tracking Using Health App
-----------------------------------------

  

Now that you are all set, you can ideally customize cycle tracking to keep a track of periods with ease. For instance, you can include/exclude cycle log options depending on whether you want to conceive or simply track your periods.  

1\. Open **Health** app on your iPhone and go to **Browse** > **Cycle Tracking** > **Options**.  

2\. Now, turn on the switch for **Symptoms** to display preferred symptoms like Abdominal cramps, Acne, Bloating, Appetite Changes, and more in the Apple Health app.

![Customize-period-tracking in Health app](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Customize-period-tracking-in-Health-app.jpg)

*   _**Sexual Activity** to display logged sexual activity._
  
*   _**Ovulation Test Results** to show the logged ovulation test results._
  
*   _**Cervical Mucus Quality** to display the logged cervical mucus data._
  
*   _**Basal Body Temperature** to display logged temperature._
  
*   _**Spotting** to show logged activities of spotting._
  

Enable Period and Fertility Predictions
---------------------------------------

  

Probably the best part about Cycle Tracking is the ability to get the period and fertility predictions. Based on the data you enter, the app predicts your period and fertile window. Predictions kickstart once you have entered your last period in the Cycle Tracking app. Do note that just in case you have logged a period before it’s likely to start, you won’t receive a period notification for that specific cycle.  

1.  Launch **Health** app on your iPhone > **Browse tab** > **Cycle Tracking** > **Options**.
  

2\. Now, turn on the switches for **Period Prediction and Fertility Prediction.**  

![Enable notification for Period and Fertility tracking](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Enable-notification-for-Period-and-Fertility-tracking.jpg)

  
  

  

The fertile window prediction completely depends on the traditional calendar method. It’s the six days during which you are most likely to be fertile. It is generally calculated by subtracting 13 days from the predicted next cycle start date.  

_**Note:** While you can track fertility windows using Cycle Tracking feature. Note that it’s not a replacement for consulting a doctor. You can use this feature in addition to your doctor to get the most accurate results. _
