If the two-finger tap gesture has simplified the task of [managing messages on iPhone](https://beebom.com/manage-messages-iphone-ipad-two-finger-tap/), the option to set up an iMessage profile has further enhanced Apple’s already feature-rich Messages app. Before iOS 13, iMessage didn’t use to share any personal information with people whenever users would communicate. While it was a good decision from the perspective of privacy, it was certainly not in sync with time. Moreover, this old-fashioned restriction would also force iPhone owners to manually set images and names for their contacts in the address book. To say the least, that was a rather tedious affair. Thankfully, those days are gone as you can now set up name and photo sharing in iMessage on your iPhone and iPad.  

Customize iMessage Profile for Name and Photo Sharing in iOS 13 and iPadOS 13
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

For those who love full-on customization, the stock messaging app offers multiple ways to personalize the iMessage profile. For instance, you can use a cool Memoji as your profile photo for iMessage. Aside from letting you choose your desired image, the app also allows you to deck up status with crazy Animojis like poop, panda, pig, robot, ghost, and more. Not to mention, the filters and colors that can come super handy in enhancing the look of your pics. That all being said, let’s customize the iMessage profile for name and photo sharing in iOS 13 and iPadOS 13.  

1\. Launch the **Messages** app on your iPhone or iPad and then tap on the **three dots** at the top right corner of the screen.
