Along with [Cycle Tracking](https://beebom.com/set-up-cycle-tracking-ios-13-watchos-6/), the Noise app is the biggest highlight of watchOS 6. With the help of the microphone and the duration of exposure, the app measures the environmental sound levels. And when Apple Watch detects that the decibel level has exceeded the set threshold and could damage your hearing, it alerts you with a gentle tap on the wrist. By default, the app notifies whenever the noise level goes past 90 decibels. However, depending on your hearing health, you can choose from multiple options like 80 or 85 decibels to stay away from the loud environment. In this guide, I’m going to walk you through the quick steps to set up the Noise app to measure decibel levels with Apple Watch. So, let’s get started!  

_**Note:** Despite the fact that watchOS 6 is being released to all the previous generations of Apple Watches barring the original Apple Watch, the Noise App will only come to the latest Apple Watch Series 5 and the previous generation Series 4 Apple Watch._  

How to Use Noise App in watchOS 6 on Apple Watch
------------------------------------------------

  

According to the World Health Organization, at 80 decibels, the volume could destroy the hearing after 5 hours and 30 minutes of exposure each day. And if the sound level goes up to 100db, the hearing could be damaged after just 3 minutes of exposure per day. Well, it just goes on to show why we must refrain from repeated and long-term exposure to loud sound.  

Set Up Noise App on Apple Watch
-------------------------------

  

1\. Launch **Noise app** on your Apple Watch.

2\. Now, tap on **Enable** to start monitoring the noise levels.

Going forward, you can use the Noise app to measure the environmental noise around you.  

_**Note:** Water and wind might have an impact on the accuracy of sound levels. During water-based activities, try using Water Lock (from the control center). It’s also worth noting that measurements are stopped when you are using Water Lock, microphone, or speaker on your smartwatch. _

  
  

  

Define Noise Threshold and Turn on Noise Notifications
------------------------------------------------------

  

1\. Open **Apple Watch app** on the companion iPhone and ensure that **My Watch** tab is selected at the bottom.

3\. Next, tap on a **Noise Threshold** located under Noise Notifications and then select a preferred option. By default, 90 decibels is selected. According to the World Health Organization, at 90 decibels the volume may damage the hearing after 30 minutes of exposure every day.  

*   _80 decibels, Limit: About 5hr 30min / day_
  
*   _85 decibels, Limit: 1hr 45min / day_
  
*   _90 decibels, Limit: 30min / day_
  
*   _95 decibels, Limit: 10 min / day_
  
*   _100 decibels, Limit: 3 min / day_

Once you have configured the noise threshold, the app will send you notifications whenever the sound level exceeds that limit.  

Track Environmental Sound Levels Using Your Apple Watch and iPhone
------------------------------------------------------------------

  

Once you have set the Noise app, you can check the noise levels of your environment right from your Apple Watch or the iPhone.  

1\. Open the **Noise** app on your Apple Watch.

  
  

  

2\. Now, a **live-updating bar graph** will display the noise level of your environment.

Under the graph, you should see a brief explanation of the sound levels. If you are exposed to a loud environment, it would warn you to stay away from that or use protection. But if the decibel level is normal, it would say that the long-term exposure to this sound won’t affect your hearing. Besides, you can also use the Noise watch face complication to track the live updates about the noise level of your environment with ease.  

How to Check Out the Noise Level from Your iPhone
-------------------------------------------------

  

1.  Launch the **Health** app on your iPhone and then tap on the **Browse** tab at the bottom of the screen.

_**Note:** On this very screen, there is also an option to check the audio levels of your headphone. It could be helpful when you want the audio level to stay within the limit._

  
  

  

Disable Noise Measuring on Apple Watch
--------------------------------------

  

Maybe you no longer find the Noise app helpful or think that you can live without it. Whatever could be your personal reason, you can turn off noise measuring on your Apple Watch with ease.  

1.  Simply open the **Settings** app on your Apple Watch and choose **Noise**.
