First introduced in iOS 12 last year, “Screen Time” has traveled to Mac with the new macOS Catalina update. As part of Apple’s digital health push, Screen Time helps you keep a track of how you spend time on your Mac and other connected devices like iPhone and iPad. With comprehensive reports, it offers better insight into your app usage, how often you pick up your device, and the number of alerts you receive – which can go a long way in getting rid of Mac addiction or cutting down unnecessary usage. What’s more, you can also set up Screen Time for a child on your Mac so that you can keep an eye on the movies your little champ watches, the websites that he/she visits or even the games they play. With that said, in this complete guide, we are going to show how you can enable Screen Time to set up parental controls on Mac in macOS Catalina to bolster your digital health or reign in your smart kid.  

Use Screen Time to Set Up Parental Controls on Mac in macOS Catalina
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  

With the introduction of macOS Catalina, Apple has replaced “Parental Controls” in System Preferences as those features have been included in Screen Time settings. Therefore, do not get confused if you don’t see the erstwhile Parental Controls icon in the System Preferences. So, first we will start by enabling Screen Time on macOS Catalina and then see how you can use it to set up parental control on your Mac.  

Enable Screen Time in macOS Catalina and Set Up Parental Controls
-----------------------------------------------------------------

  

1\. Open **System Preferences** on your Mac by clicking on the Apple menu at the top left corner of the screen and choosing System Preferences.

5\. Now, based on your preference, you can customize the Screen Time settings on your macOS device.  

*   _**Share across devices:** Enable this option if you want the Screen Time to present a comprehensive report of the time spent on all of your devices synced with the same Apple ID. _
  
*   _**Use Screen Time Passcode:** Choose this option to prevent anyone from making changes to Screen Times settings without your permission. Besides, it will also ensure that your kids will need your approval for the additional time when limits expire. _
  
*   _**Include Website Data:** Enable this option to get the details about the specific websites that your kid visits. (this option appears only when you are using Family Sharing.) _
  

6\. Up next, configure all the following options in line with your requirements:  

*   _**Downtime:** It lets you set a daily schedule for when you don’t want to use your Mac. During this period, only the apps you allow and phone calls will be available. You will get a reminder five minutes before the downtime starts. Moreover, it will apply to all the synced devices. To set up downtime, choose it in the sidebar and then click on **Turn ON.** After that, set the schedule as desired. _

Do note that app limits will apply to all the connected devices and will automatically reset every day at midnight. Again, you will get an alert five minutes before the limit expires. _
