Despite the [meteoric rise](https://beebom.com/tiktok-downloads-july-2019/), TikTok has been [embroiled into too many controversies](https://beebom.com/80-youngsters-want-tiktok-banned-in-india-survey/). So much so that the video-sharing social networking service was banned in many parts of the world including India. As you may have guessed, it’s the obscene content that has proved to be the wrecker-in-chief for the ByteDance owned platform. While I’m a huge fan of lip-syncing videos showcasing stunning dancing skill or out-of-the-box creativity, I always felt the company could do a lot better to ward off offensive stuff so that everyone from a little kid to a grown-up can use the app safely. So, I’m pleased to know that ByteDance now allows users to set up parental controls for TikTok on iPhone and Android. If you are yet to unravel this feature, let me help you get going!  

Set Up Parental Controls for TikTok on iPhone and Android
---------------------------------------------------------

  

There are two ways to enable parent control on TikTok on your iPhone and Android device. First is to use the native parental control methods that come in the app. And the second is to use the OS level parental controls on your iPhone or Android device. We have explained both the methods below.  

### Enable Parental Controls on TikTok Using Native Method

  

TikTok features a pretty handy native parental control feature. So, if you don’t want to go for a [full-on Screen Time](https://beebom.com/set-up-parental-control-mac-macos-catalina/) on your iPhone or Android device, you can enable the restriction right from the [social networking app](https://beebom.com/facebook-alternatives/). Aside from allowing you to enable app limitation, TikTok also offers a reliable way to reign in inappropriate content from showing up in the personal feed.  

_**Note:** The steps to enable parental controls using the app is same on iPhone and Android. So, we are only attaching screenshots from the iOS version of the app._  

1\. Launch the **TikTok** app on your device and tap on the **profile tab** at the bottom.

*   _**Screen Time Management** – It lets you set up the screen time limit for the TikTok app. To enable this feature, **tap on it**. Then, tap on **Time Limit** and then choose the preferred time from multiple options like **40m, 60m, 90m, and 120m. **_
  

_![get started with screen time management for TikTok](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/get-started-with-screen-time-management-for-TikTok.jpg)After that, tap on **“Turn on Screen Time Management”** and **set a passcode.**_

Once the time is up, you will get an alert, saying something like it’s time to wind up. If you still want to use the app, you will need to authenticate using the passcode.  

### Set Time Limit for TikTok Using Screen Time on iPhone and iPad

  

Just in case you want to have more control over TikTok, you can use the [built-in Screen Time feature](https://beebom.com/how-set-up-communication-limits-iphone-ipad/) to prevent your kid from overusing the app. Do note that app limits will apply to all the devices synced with the same iCloud account. Moreover, the limits will reset every day at midnight.

  
  

  

1\. Open **Settings app** on your device **\-> Screen Time -> App Limits.**  

![Tap on App Limits](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Tap-on-App-Limits-.jpg)

2\. Now, tap on **Add Limit** and then enter your **Screen Time Passcode. **

3\. Next, tap on **Creativity** and select **TikTok**. Then, tap on **Next.** After that, set the time limit and tap on **Add** at the top right to finish.

_**Note:** You can also customize the restriction based on days if you want to. To do so, tap on Customise Days and then fine-tune the limitation as per requirement. _  

From now onwards, an alert will appear five minutes before the limit is reached. And when the timer runs out, you will need to enter the passcode to use the app.  

### Set Up Parental Controls for TikTok on Android using Digital Wellbeing

  

The latest versions of Android including [Android Pie](https://beebom.com/android-p-features/) and [Android Q](https://beebom.com/android-q-features/) come with a full-fledged parental control feature that can help you set up parental controls for the TikTok app on your Android smartphone or tablet.
