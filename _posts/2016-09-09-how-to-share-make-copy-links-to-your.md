Google Drive lets you send a file to others with a link to “Make a Copy” while maintaining the original. The copy is then saved into the recipient’s Drive where they can edit it however they want.

This guide works for [Google Docs](https://www.howtogeek.com/435522/how-to-copy-google-drive-folders/), Sheets, Slides, and Drawing files. We’ll be using Docs, but the procedure for each service is essentially the same.

Fire up the [Google Docs homepage](https://docs.google.com/document/) and open a file you want to share with someone to make a copy. Right-click the URL in the address bar and click “Copy.”

Next, open [Gmail](http://mail.google.com) and compose a new message to the recipient. Paste the URL into the body of the message with Ctrl+V (Windows/Chrome OS) or Cmd+V (macOS), click on it to bring up the More menu, and then click on “Change.”

At the very end of the URL, change “Edit” to “Copy” and then click “OK” to save the web address.
