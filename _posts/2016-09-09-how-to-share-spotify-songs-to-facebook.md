In May 2018, Spotify added the option to [share songs to Instagram Stories](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/add-music-instagram-stories/). This adds a sticker to an Instagram Story, allowing viewers to click through to hear the song. Then, in September 2019, Spotify added the option to share songs to Facebook Stories.

How to Share Spotify Songs to Facebook Stories
----------------------------------------------

As detailed on [the Spotify for Artists Blog](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/share-your-songs-on-facebook-stories-now-with-music), Spotify now lets you share music directly to Facebook Stories. You can share songs, albums, playlists, or your profile, all of which will generate a link people can click on to end up on the Spotify app.

However, if you share a single song (rather than an album, playlist, or your profile), anyone who views your Facebook Story will be treated to a 15-second preview of that song. They can then click “Play on Spotify” to hear the rest of the track.

To share a Spotify song to a Facebook Story, tap “Share” when viewing a track on Spotify. Select Facebook, choose to customize your Story, and post it. Viewers of the Facebook Story will be able to preview the track instantly, or click through to hear the rest.

Spotify notes that “the previews are generated from our Web API,” and that the “Feature availability will differ based on territory”. Unfortunately, Spotify doesn’t list the countries supported, so you’ll have to try sharing songs to find out where it works.

This is beneficial to everyone involved. Ordinary users get to share their songs with friends. Artists get to share music with their fans. Spotify gets people interacting with its API. And Facebook gets another tool to improve engagement with Stories.

If any of your friends or fans clicks through to Spotify after seeing a song on a Facebook Story you should direct them to [our beginner’s guide to Spotify](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/spotify-music-streaming-unofficial-guide/).
