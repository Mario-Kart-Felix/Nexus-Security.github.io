Tie dyeing is a great way to make a plain, white garment look more interesting and colorful. The most popular design is the spiral. The trick to getting the design is to twist the shirt into a disk, then wrap rubber bands around it. T-shirts are the most popular item to tie dye, but you may be able to use other items too, such as sarongs.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Spiral-Tie-Dye&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Tying and Soaking the Fabric")\]Tying and Soaking the Fabric

1.  Get a white, 100% cotton T-shirt that you want to tie dye. It can be brand-new or an older shirt. If the shirt is brand-new, wash it first to remove any coatings that might prevent the dye from adhering. If it's an older shirt, make sure that it's clean. You can also use other items, such as sarongs and pillowcases as long as they're white and 100% cotton.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   Don't use colored items, or the dye won't show up. The fabric must also be 100% cotton in order for the dye to adhere.
    *   Items with large surface areas will work the best. Something like a pair of shorts or socks will be difficult to twist into a spiral.
2.  Spread the shirt out on a smooth, flat surface. You won’t be dyeing on this surface, so it can be anything, as long as it's flat and rigid. A table or a hardwood floor would work the best. Don’t work on carpet, grass, or concrete; the texture will create too much friction for the twisting part.
    
    [![Spiral Tie Dye Step 2 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c8/Spiral-Tie-Dye-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/aid8355724-v4-728px-Spiral-Tie-Dye-Step-2-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Spiral-Tie-Dye-Step-2-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   if you're tie dyeing something else, then make sure that you spread it out flat as well.
3.  Place a fork in the center of the shirt with the prongs pointing down. The fork should be perpendicular to the shirt and the surface that you’re working on.[\[2\]](#_note-2) Alternatively, pinch the center of the shirt between your thumb and index finger. This will form the center of your spiral.  
      
    *   For a more unique design, pinch elsewhere on the shirt. For example, you could pinch the top-right corner or the bottom-left corner.
4.  Use the fork to twist the shirt into a disk. Twirl the fork between your fingers until the shirt starts to gather into a spiral. Once you’ve twisted the shirt as much as you can, use your hands to finish tucking any loose bits of fabric against the bundle.[\[3\]](#_note-3)  
      
    *   This is a little like winding spaghetti around the prongs of a fork.
    *   You can twist the shirt clockwise or counterclockwise.
    *   If you pinched the fabric with your fingers, simply twist your hand like turning a key. You'll have to re-pinch and adjust your hand after each twist.
5.  Wrap 3 to 4 rubber bands around the disk. Wrap the first 2 rubber bands around the spiraled disk to make a cross shape. Add 1 or 2 more rubber bands to make the bundle more secure. Make sure that all of the rubber bands meet in the middle.[\[4\]](#_note-4)  
      
    *   Space the rubber bands evenly, like the numbers on a clock, or just wrap them around the bundle randomly.
    *   If the bundle feels loose, add a few more rubber bands.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Spiral-Tie-Dye&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Preparing the Soda Ash and Dye")\]Preparing the Soda Ash and Dye

1.  Put on a pair of plastic gloves and a dust mask. Soda ash and dye can irritate skin and cause allergic reactions, so put those gloves on. The fine particles in soda ash and powdered dyes can also irritate your lungs, so a dust mask would also be a good idea.[\[5\]](#_note-5)  
      
    *   Not all fabric dyes require soda ash. Double-check the instructions on the dye package.
    *   It would be a good idea to put on an old set of clothes or an apron. This way, you won't risk accidentally staining your clothes.
    *   Work outside, if possible. If you can't, cover your work surface with a plastic tablecloth or several layers of newspaper.
2.  Mix 1 cup (598 g) of soda ash with of warm water. Pour of warm water into a large bucket, then stir in 1 cup (598 g) of soda ash. The soda ash is the magic ingredient that will set the dye into the fabric without the use of heat or constant soaking.[\[6\]](#_note-6)  
      
    *   Once you add the T-shirt, the water level will rise, so make sure that the bucket is big enough. Something that can hold would work.
3.  Choose your desired colors of fiber reactive dyes. These dyes are wonderful for tie dyeing because you don't need heat to activate them. You also don't need to leave the fabric in the dye for long periods of time. This makes it easy to apply multiple colors at once.[\[7\]](#_note-7)
    
    [![Spiral Tie Dye Step 8 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9f/Spiral-Tie-Dye-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/aid8355724-v4-728px-Spiral-Tie-Dye-Step-8-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Spiral-Tie-Dye-Step-8-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   You can get fiber reactive dyes online. Fabric stores and craft stores also sell them, but typically in kits.
    *   Fiber reactive dyes come in powdered form, but not all powdered dyes are fiber reactive. Read the label!
    *   How many colors you choose is up to you. Most people stick with 2 colors, but you can use anywhere between 1 and 4 colors.
4.  Mix the dye with the amount of water recommended on the package. Each brand of dye will require a different amount of water. If your fiber reactive dye came in a plastic squeeze bottle, you'll most likely have to fill the bottle to the fill line with water. Again, read the instructions.[\[8\]](#_note-8)
    
    [![Spiral Tie Dye Step 9 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/61/Spiral-Tie-Dye-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/aid8355724-v4-728px-Spiral-Tie-Dye-Step-9-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Spiral-Tie-Dye-Step-9-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   If your dye came in a packet, mix the dye in a jar first, then transfer it into a plastic squeeze bottle.
    *   Some dyes can be mixed ahead of time and stored indefinitely while others need to be used immediately. Read the instructions on your package of dye.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Spiral-Tie-Dye&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Soaking and Dyeing the Fabric")\]Soaking and Dyeing the Fabric

1.  Soak the shirt in the soda ash solution for 10 to 20 minutes. Dunk the shirt into the soda ash solution, then squeeze it to ensure that it's thoroughly soaked. Leave it in the bucket for 10 to 20 minutes.[\[9\]](#_note-9)
    
    [![Spiral Tie Dye Step 10 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/93/Spiral-Tie-Dye-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/aid8355724-v4-728px-Spiral-Tie-Dye-Step-10-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Spiral-Tie-Dye-Step-10-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   If the shirt floats in the water, it's not soaked through. Squeeze it some more, or allow it to soak longer.
    *   You can remove the dust mask at this point since the soda ash and dye powders are dissolved. You should keep the gloves and old clothes/apron on, however.
2.  Take the shirt out and squeeze out the excess soda ash solution. After this, you won’t need the soda ash solution again, so dump it out. If you’re dyeing more shirts, however, leave it in the bucket and soak the rest of your desired items.[\[10\]](#_note-10)  
      
    *   You can pour the soda ash solution down the drain. It won't harm the pipes. In fact, it may even clear out any clogs!
3.  Use the squeeze bottles to apply the dye to the front of the disk. Use whatever pattern you like. Most people prefer to use 1 color per section. Some people like to apply the colors randomly with multiple colors per section. Make sure that you stick the nozzle into the creases and folds, however; otherwise, the dye won't penetrate.[\[11\]](#_note-11)  
      
    *   Each space between 2 rubber bands counts as 1 section.
    *   Work on top of a surface that can get dirty or stained. An old baking sheet covered with plastic wrap would work great.
4.  Flip the disk over and apply the dye to the other side. Use the same colors and patterns as you did for the front, or change them up for a more unique design. Once you are done, pour the rest of the dye down the drain.[\[12\]](#_note-12)  
      
    *   You may be able to save the dye for later. Each brand is different, however, so read the label to find out whether or not you can store it for later use.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Spiral-Tie-Dye&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Setting and Rinsing the Dye")\]Setting and Rinsing the Dye

1.  Place the shirt into a plastic bag for 24 hours. Use a resealable bag, such as a Ziploc bag. If you can only get a plain plastic bag, tie it shut instead. Leave the shirt in the bag for 24 hours so that the dye can set.[\[13\]](#_note-13)  
      
    *   Don't untie the shirt before you put it into the bag.
    *   Place the bag on top of a tray or a larger plastic bag in case the dye leaks. This will protect your work surface against stains.
2.  Remove the shirt from the bag with gloved hands. Put the plastic gloves back on your hands, then take the shirt out of the bag. Do not take the rubber bands off; leave them on.[\[14\]](#_note-14)  
      
    *   If you take the rubber bands off now, you risk getting dye onto the white areas of the shirt and ruining the tie dye effect.
3.  Rinse the shirt with cool water until the water runs clear. How long you rinse the shirt for depends on the brand and colors of dye that you used. Some will take a lot longer to rinse than others. Keep your gloves on for this step as the dye may still stain your hands.[\[15\]](#_note-15)  
      
    
4.  Remove the rubber bands, then rinse the shirt again. If you can't pull the rubber bands, cut them off instead. Shake the shirt out so that it's smooth, then rinse it again to get the rest of the dye out. Be sure to use cool water, not warm.[\[16\]](#_note-16)  
      
    *   Remember to wear your plastic gloves so that you don't get dye on your hands!
    *   You need to rinse the shirt twice because some of the dye was trapped inside the spiral.
5.  Wash the shirt in the washing machine. There will still be some dye left in the shirt, so it would be best to wash it separate from the rest of your laundry. If that's not possible, add a dye-setting solution (e.g.: Synthrapol) into your laundry. This will prevent the dye from staining the rest of your laundry.[\[17\]](#_note-17)  
      
    *   Alternatively, wash the shirt with similar colors. You can also wash it with black clothing; the dye won't show up on that.
    *   Stick with a "cool" or "cold" water setting. It is safe for all fabrics and won't fade the dye.
6.  Allow the shirt to dry. Hang the shirt up in the sun or use a clothes dryer. The heat from the dryer would actually help set the dye into the fabric better, but be aware that it may also cause the shirt to shrink a little!

    *   Once the shirt is dry, it's ready to wear!
    *   If you are using a clothes dryer, you can dry the shirt with other items. The color should not transfer to other garments.

\[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Spiral-Tie-Dye&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Tips")\]Tips
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Wash the shirt separately from the rest of your laundry for the first 3 or 4 washes to minimize bleeding. Alternatively, wash it with like or black colors.
*   If you can't get a white shirt, consider using the [reverse tie dye](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Bleach-T-Shirt "Make a Bleach T Shirt") technique with bleach and a colored shirt.

\[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Spiral-Tie-Dye&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Warnings")\]Warnings
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Don't reuse measuring cups and stirring utensils for food or cooking. Washing alone won't remove the contaminants from the dye and soda ash.
