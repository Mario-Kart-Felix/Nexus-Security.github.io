When you have an unlimited data plan, there is no harm in watching the best available quality content, is it? By default, Apple TV+ app streams lower-quality content to [use less of your data](https://beebom.com/enable-low-data-mode-ios-13-iphone-ipad/), which is a wise decision considering how fast a full-on binge-watching can gobble up the entire data plan. But what if you have the luxury of an unlimited data plan, wouldn’t you want to stream high-quality [Apple TV+ movies and shows](https://beebom.com/apple-tv-plus-complete-show-movies-list/) on mobile data?  Most probably, you would. To get the most out of Apple’s offerings, let’s customize the TV app’s settings so that it can deliver the best for you!

------------------------------------------------------------

  

According to a [study](https://www.flatpanelshd.com/flatforums/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=12779) conducted by FlatpanelsHD founder Rasmus Larsen, Apple TV+ boasts the _**highest 4K streaming quality provided by a streaming service that supports 4K**_. It states that the app uses variable bitrate with a wide span from low to top, averaging 29Mb/s video bitrate and a 41Mb/s peak. Of course, watching 4K videos on iPhone isn’t possible as yet (even though [shooting 4K video and selfies](https://beebom.com/best-iphone-11-11-pro-11-pro-max-camera-tips/) seems an old story now). But we can definitely squeeze the best out of the TV app to ramp up video streaming.  

1\. Navigate to the **Settings app** on your iPhone or iPad. Scroll down and choose the **Apple** **TV** icon.

2\. Now, tap on **iTunes Videos.**

_**Note:** By default, **Good** is selected so that you can watch lower-quality TV shows and movies and be able to save mobile data. But if you have the luxury of plenty of data (like I have), it’s better to stream the top quality content._  

Later, if you ever want to cut down your cellular data usage, all you need to do is return to this setting and select a Good option in the end.

What if you have a limited internet plan and want to stream low-quality Apple TV shows or movies to prevent the app from eating into large share of data? Turns out, there is a way to do it as well.  

1.Open **Settings** app on your device > **TV > iTunes Videos. **  

![Launch Settings and hit TV option and then choose iTunes Videos](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Launch-Settings-and-hit-TV-option-and-then-choose-iTunes-Videos.jpg)

2\. Under **Playback Quality**, tap on **Wi-Fi. **  

![Select Wi-Fi](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Select-Wi-Fi.jpg)

3\. By default, the **Best Available** option is selected so that you can watch high-quality content. Choose **Good** to force the TV app to use less data.

_**Note:** Depending on your convenience, you can choose to have all of your purchases and rentals in high definition or standard definition. To do so, simply tap on **Purchases and Rentals**. After that, choose the desired option. For instance, if you have a fast internet connection, go for the High Definition option. When you are dealing with a sluggish internet connection, choose Standard Definition. _
