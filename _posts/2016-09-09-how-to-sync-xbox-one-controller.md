Wireless controllers are convenient, but connecting them can be a bit confusing. If you’re wondering how to connect an Xbox One controller to your console, you’ve come to the right place.

Whether you have bought a new controller and need to sync it to your Xbox One or have brought your controller over to a friend’s Xbox, it isn’t difficult to pair your Xbox One controller. 

In this article we show you how to sync a controller to each model of the Xbox One, as well as a few tips if this doesn’t work for any reason.

How to Sync an Xbox One Controller to Your Console Wirelessly
-------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Turn on the Xbox One you want to sync with by pressing the **Xbox** button on the front of the system.
2.  Next, turn on your controller by holding the **Xbox** button for a moment. The Xbox button will flash, indicating that it’s looking for a console to sync with.
3.  Press and release the **Bind** button on your console.
    *   On the Xbox One X and Xbox One S, you’ll find this small circular button at the bottom-right of your system, under the power button.
    *   For the original model Xbox One, the button is on the left side of the console, right around the corner from the disc slot.
4.  After pressing the button on your console, press and hold the small circular **Bind** button on top of your controller. The Xbox button should flash a few times, then stay solid once connected.

How to Pair Your Xbox One Controller Using a Cable
--------------------------------------------------

If you’d rather, you can also use a micro-USB cable to pair your Xbox One controller and console.

Simply plug the cable into a USB port on Xbox, then connect the other end to your controller. Once they’re connected, press and hold the **Xbox** button on the controller to sync them. You can disconnect the cable to use the controller wirelessly after the syncing completes.

How to Sync an Xbox Controller to Your PC
-----------------------------------------

We’ve written a full guide explaining [how to connect your Xbox One controller to a Windows PC](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/connect-xbox-one-controller-pc/). Follow those steps to use your existing controller with your favorite PC games.

Can’t Connect Your Xbox One Controller?
---------------------------------------

The above steps should sync your Xbox controller and console in most cases. But if pairing doesn’t work, try these tips:

*   Try replacing the batteries in the controller. If you use the Xbox One Play and Charge Kit for rechargeable batteries, make sure your controller is charged.
*   Keep the controller close to the console when you sync it. The wireless connection between your console and controller has a range of about 20-30 feet.
*   Turn off any other wireless devices (like microwaves or laptops) that are close to the Xbox and controller to reduce interference.
*   Fully restart your console by holding the **Xbox** button on the front of the system for about 10 seconds. Disconnect the power cable for at least 30 seconds, then reconnect it and turn on your system again.
*   Remember that you can only have eight controllers connected to the system at once.

When you press the **Xbox** button on your controller, it tries to connect to the system it was last paired to. If you have multiple Xbox One consoles, your controller thus might be connecting to another system as soon as you turn it on.

Try fully shutting down and unplugging any other Xbox One systems in your vicinity to avoid this overlap. This also applies when you’re trying to connect an Xbox One controller to a PC when the controller is already paired with your nearby console.
