Realme has just started rolling out its [Android 10](https://beebom.com/android-q-features/) based Realme UI to the Realme XT and the Realme 3 Pro, and it comes with some interesting changes and visual overhauls. Among the many [new Realme UI features](https://beebom.com/realme-ui-features/) are a bunch of new ways to take a screenshot, share them, and even take long screenshots. So, if you have just updated your smartphone and can’t wait to share those memes with your friends, here’s how to take a screenshot in Realme UI.  

How to Take a Screenshot in Realme UI
-------------------------------------

  

If you’re just looking to take a plain old screenshot in Realme UI, that method is the same as it has always been. You can use the **power button + volume down key combo**, or perform a three finger swipe down on the screen to take a screenshot — that’s easy. However, with Realme UI, you can do some more interesting things with screenshots as well.  

Take a Partial Screenshot in Realme UI
--------------------------------------

  

There are times when you simply want to share a part of your screen with someone. This could be if you’re trying to share a meme you saw on Instagram, or a hilarious text message you just need to show your friend. While you can take a screenshot and then crop it out (that’s what I have to do on my phone), Realme UI makes it easier.  

Simply **press and hold on the screen with three fingers** and you will see a selection box that you can drag up or down to **select the area of the screen** of which you want to take a partial screenshot. I’ve shown this process in the screen recording below.  

  

Take a Long Screenshot in Realme UI
-----------------------------------

  

If you often find yourself in situations where you want to take a screenshot of a long webpage, or maybe a screenshot of your entire Spotify playlist for some reason, Realme UI’s long screenshot function might come in handy. This feature has existed since before Realme UI was a thing, but with the new update it’s easier to take a long screenshot on your phone. Here’s how:  

Simply **take a screenshot with the three finger gesture**, or by pressing the power button + volume down button combo. Once you take the screenshot, a floating window will appear showing you the screenshot you just took.  

**Tap and hold on this floating screenshot window, and drag it upwards** to start taking a long screenshot on your phone as shown in the screen recording below.  

  
  

  

Turn off Screenshot Sounds in Realme UI
---------------------------------------

  

One of my biggest peeves with taking screenshots on smartphones is the sound that plays when you take a screenshot. It sounds very much like clicking a picture, which leads to a lot of confused looks from people around me whenever I take a screenshot. That’s not good. Fortunately, Realme UI lets you disable screenshot sounds easily.  

You can simply go to “**Settings > Sound & Vibration**” and turn off the toggle next to “**Screenshot Sound**”

Take Screenshots in Realme UI with These Handy Gestures
-------------------------------------------------------

  

As you can see, Realme UI brings a ton of useful gestures for taking screenshots, be it regular screenshots, partial screenshots, or even long screenshots. In fact, you can even share screenshots with a quick drag-down gesture on the floating screenshot window that pops up after you take a screenshot. It’s pretty handy, and I really like the new screen capture gestures that Realme UI brings to Realme smartphones.
