A new Android device means transferring all of your content, including your favorite apps, from old to new. You don’t have to do this manually as Google offers built-in support for backing up and restoring your content. Here’s how you do it.

These steps may vary based on your device manufacturer, Android version, and may only be available on newer builds of Android. If you don’t have these steps available at all, you can use a third-party app provided by your device manufacturer to transfer your apps instead.

Using the Google Backup Method
------------------------------

Google uses your Google account to back up your content, including apps, using your included Drive storage. You’ll need to make sure you’ve enabled Google Backup on your old device before you make any transfers.

### Switch On Google Backup

To start, access your device “Settings” menu in the app drawer or by swiping down to access your notification shade and then tap the gear icon.

Next, tap on “System.” If you have a Samsung device, the option is “Accounts and Backup.”

In the next menu, Samsung owners will need to tap “Backup and Restore.” Other Android device owners can ignore this step.
