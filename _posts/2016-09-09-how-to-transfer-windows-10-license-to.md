The best part about Windows 10 is that you can transfer the license key to another computer in case you are upgrading your machine or moving to a new computer. It saves you from spending big dollars and that is really great on Microsoft’s part. So, in this article, we are going to show you how to transfer a Windows 10 license to a new computer. We have shared two simple methods so you can move to a new PC without much friction. In addition, we have also explained some specific details which will help you find whether your license key is transferrable or not. Now having said that, let’s start the article without further delay.  

Is Your Windows 10 License Transferrable?
-----------------------------------------

  

You can only transfer a Windows 10 license if you have a Retail key– either purchased from a store or online portal (a digital copy). You can **check the type of product key** by following these steps. Press Windows and R keys at once and type “cmd”. Here, type _slmgr -dli _and hit enter. A dialog box will appear with the description of the product key. **If it shows retail then you are good to go**. However, if it shows OEM then sadly, you can’t transfer the license to another computer.

Apart from that, you must **ensure the same edition of Windows 10 is installed** on both the computers. For example, if you have an activated Windows 10 Home PC then you can only transfer the license to another Windows 10 Home PC.  

Also, if you are swapping a new hard disk on an old laptop or PC then you don’t have to do anything. Just do a [fresh installation of Windows 10](https://beebom.com/create-windows-10-bootable-usb/) and **the OS will automatically pick the product key** since the license is tied to the motherboard. You just have to choose the correct edition during the installation. Having said that, if it asks for a product key during the process, simply choose “I don’t have a product key” and proceed with the installation. Later, Windows 10 will automatically activate itself after connecting to Microsoft servers.  

So those are some key points to keep in mind before transferring a Windows 10 license. If you fulfill these criteria, you can go ahead and move to a new PC with your license intact.
