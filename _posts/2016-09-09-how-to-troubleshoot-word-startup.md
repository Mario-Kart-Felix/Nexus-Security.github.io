Microsoft Office is constantly working to improve its software. Still, there might be times when Word just refuses to start. Here are a few ways you can get Word up and running again.

Update Microsoft Office
-----------------------

It’s always a good idea to [keep your software up to date](https://www.howtogeek.com/413180/windows-10s-check-for-updates-button-just-got-safer/) as companies constantly issue fixes for bugs and vulnerabilities that hinder the performance of the application.

Since Office 2013, Microsoft issues any updates to its Office applications automatically [unless you told it to do otherwise](https://www.howtogeek.com/395315/how-to-turn-off-automatic-app-updates-from-the-microsoft-store-in-windows-10/). If that’s the case, and you’re experiencing startup issues with Word, you might want to update it to the latest version and see if that fixes the problem.

The good news is you can do this from any of your Office apps. So, if Word won’t start, you can update through Excel, PowerPoint, or any other Office programs you happen to have.

To update, open your Office app, click the “File” tab, and then click “Account” at the bottom of the left panel.

Under the “Product Information” section, click “Update Options” next to “Office Updates.” In the drop-down menu, select “Update Now.”

Office checks for and applies any updates. After the update completes, you see a success message.
