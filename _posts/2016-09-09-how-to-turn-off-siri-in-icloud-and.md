Ever since the sensitive report about how Apple contractors [listened to private Siri recordings](https://beebom.com/apple-contractors-listen-siri-audio-samples/) came out in the open, the safeguard of my personal voice recordings has begun to concern me like never before. While I’m pleased with the way Apple has addressed the whole Siri grading controversy by not only providing a straightforward way to [delete Siri and Dictation history](https://beebom.com/how-delete-siri-dictation-history-macos-catalina/) across iDevices but also allowing users to [opt-out of the audio recording program](https://beebom.com/how-opt-out-siri-audio-recordings-iphone-ipad-mac-watch-tv/), I still wish to add an extra shield for the private voice recordings. And that’s exactly what drove me to turn off Siri in iCloud and delete everything that Siri has learned. In this article, I am going to show you how you can wipe out everything that Siri has learned about you by following this hands-on guide.  

Disable Siri in iCloud and Delete What Siri has Learnt

### Is the Trade-Off Worth It?

  

But before going ahead with the quick steps, let me clear out a few clouds that might be running in the background. First things first, it _**turns off the virtual assistant only in the iCloud, and not on your device.**_ That means you can continue to use the personal assistant on your device without any problem. And second, it **_limits Siri’s learning to an individual iDevice_**.  

Will it affect your user experience? Of course, it will. Siri won’t be able to offer recommendations based on what it has learned on your other devices synced with the same iCloud account. However, restricting its learning can play a vital role in [protecting your privacy](https://beebom.com/improve-security-privacy-tips-ios-13/). If you find the trade-off worth, let’s get started with the guide!  

### Steps to Disable Siri in iCloud and Delete the Data
