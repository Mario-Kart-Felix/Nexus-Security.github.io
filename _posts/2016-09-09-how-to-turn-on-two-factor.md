Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a great security tool as it makes it harder for attackers to break into your account. Most apps make it pretty easy to turn on 2FA, and Twitter is no exception. Here’s how to enable it.

To begin, you’ll need to be logged in to your Twitter account, either on the [Twitter website](https://twitter.com) or in the [Twitter app](https://twitter.com/download?lang=en) for Android, iPhone, or iPad. The process is almost identical for both, except for the starting point.

The 2FA process for Twitter sets up SMS messaging by default. If you want to use an authenticator app, you’ll have to go through this process and then change from using SMS to using an authenticator app.
