Public Wi-Fi is freely available, but [it does come with risks](https://www.howtogeek.com/178696/why-using-a-public-wi-fi-network-can-be-dangerous-even-when-accessing-encrypted-websites/). If you enable the hotspot feature on your Android handset instead, you can create a portable Wi-Fi network and connect other devices to the internet.

Mobile Wi-Fi hotspots are useful in other situations, too. For example, if your internet connection goes down at home, you can switch to your hotspot and get your other devices back online in seconds.

Thanks to [Android fragmentation](https://www.howtogeek.com/305771/fragmentation-isn%E2%80%99t-androids-fault-it%E2%80%99s-the-manufacturers/), the steps to set up your mobile hotspot might vary, depending on your phone’s manufacturer and the version of Android it’s running.

Configure Your Phone’s Mobile Wi-Fi Hotspot
-------------------------------------------

Android has included some form of a Wi-Fi hotspot since 2.2 Froyo, so it should be available on your phone. However, you need to check with your mobile carrier to see if your plan allows you to share your data connection.

To create your Wi-Fi hotspot, open your device settings; you can do this from the apps drawer. Or swipe down on your display to view the notifications shade, and then tap the gear icon at the top right.

The next step varies depending on your device. On a Samsung device, tap “Connections”; otherwise tap “Network & Internet.”
