If your toilet is clogged and you don’t have a plunger nearby, you can still use many other things in your household to loosen the blockage. For a serious clog, you may need to use a special toilet auger to break it apart. When you’re finished, your toilet should work like new!

1.  Add of dish soap to your toilet and let it soak for 25 minutes. Pour liquid dish soap directly into the toilet bowl so it can sink to the bottom.

During this time, you may notice the water level go down as the clog loosens up.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   Only pour hot water into the bowl if there’s no risk of it overflowing.
    *   You can also add 1 cup (200 g) of Epsom salt to help break apart the clog.
3.  Try flushing the toilet to see if the clog went through. Flush your toilet as normal and see if it drains completely. If it does, then the dish soap and hot water worked as intended. If not, you may try again or try to break the clog a different way.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

    *   Make sure the vinegar doesn’t fizz over the edge of your toilet or else you’ll have a bigger mess to clean.
