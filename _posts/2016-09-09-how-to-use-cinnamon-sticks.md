1.  Use cinnamon sticks and leather cord to make scented ornaments. String a piece of leather cord, about long, through the hollow center of 3 cinnamon sticks. Fold the cinnamon sticks into a triangle shape, then pull the cord tight to secure the shape. Tie the loose ends together at the top. To hang the ornament, cut another piece of leather cord about . Loop it around the top of the triangle and tie it in a knot to secure.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   You can also use a piece of twine or hemp instead of a leather cord.
    *   For more of a holiday vibe, use craft glue to glue a piece of tree garland onto the bottom corner of the triangle cinnamon ornament.[\[2\]](#_note-2)
2.  Make a fall-ready cinnamon stick candle. Coarsely chop 4 cinnamon sticks and set aside. Set out your candle holder (you can use a jar, small bowl, or any small container you’d like) on a flat surface. Lay one end of a candle wick in the center of the bowl then wrap the other end around a pencil to hold the wick straight up and in place. Melt candle wax in a nonstick pan on low heat. Once melted, mix the chopped cinnamon sticks into the wax and quickly pour the hot wax into the candle holder to fill it about ¾ of the way up.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

    *   Let the wax cool and harden for at least 15 minutes before removing the pencil and trimming the wick as needed.
    *   To make your candle’s cinnamon scent stronger, add a few drops of cinnamon extract to the wax as its melting.[\[4\]](#_note-4)
3.  Craft your own homemade spice potpourri. Preheat your oven to . Thinly slice an apple and an orange and lay the slices flat on a baking sheet. Bake the fruit slices for an hour and a half, then remove them from the oven to cool. Once cool, mix the slices in a large jar with about 2 tablespoons (28.3 grams) of cloves, 3 to 5 cinnamon sticks, and about 2 tablespoons (28.3 grams) of star anise..[\[5\]](#_note-5)

    *   Put the lid on the jar and let the mixture settle for 1 day before pouring out and displaying it in a bowl or decorative jar.[\[6\]](#_note-6)
4.  Secure cinnamon sticks together for easy scented drink coasters. Set out about 5 or 6 cinnamon sticks. Add a dab of craft glue to the center of one of the cinnamon sticks, and press another stick to it firmly to secure the two together. Repeat this process until all 5 or 6 cinnamon sticks are glued together.[\[7\]](#_note-7)

    *   To add a bit more visual interest to your coasters, weave a piece of colorful string or twine along the ends of the cinnamon sticks (like a log raft). This will make your coasters look a bit more finished.[\[8\]](#_note-8)
5.  Tie cinnamon sticks onto gifts for an added personal touch. For an easy way to elevate your fall or holiday gifts, use ribbon, twine, or holiday-colored string to tie a few cinnamon sticks onto your wrapped gifts. The recipient will surely appreciate your added effort and the pleasant scent.

    *   In addition to wrapped gifts, you can tie a few cinnamon sticks onto soaps, jam jars, or cider mix for an easy yet thoughtful gift for your friends, neighbors, or family members.[\[9\]](#_note-9)
6.  Make a moth-repelling pouch for your closet. Fill a small mesh baggie or sachet with a cinnamon stick, 1 tablespoon (14.3 grams) of black peppercorns, and 1 tablespoon (14.3 grams) of whole cloves. Hang the pouch on a hanger in your closet, or place it in a dresser drawer to keep moths off of your clothing.[\[10\]](#_note-10)
