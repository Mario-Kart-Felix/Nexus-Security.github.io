If you don’t want to throw your yolks away, you might be looking for easy recipes that only require the yolks of eggs, and not the whites. By making an egg wash, creating a custard, or mixing up some mayonnaise, you can get use out of your leftover egg yolks and create something delicious in the process.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Use-Egg-Yolks&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Making an Egg Wash")\]Making an Egg Wash

1.  Mix 3-4 egg yolks with of water or milk. Use a whisk or fork to lightly blend your ingredients together, just enough that they will spread smoothly onto a pastry surface.[\[1\]](#_note-1)  
      
    
    [![Use Egg Yolks Step 1.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5f/Use-Egg-Yolks-Step-1.jpg/aid11318963-v4-728px-Use-Egg-Yolks-Step-1.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Use-Egg-Yolks-Step-1.jpg)
    
    *   Using milk in your egg wash mixture will give it a creamier texture and make your wash stick to uneven surfaces more easily. Using water will help thin it out the yolk and make it easier to spread over large areas.
2.  Apply your egg wash to uncooked dough with a pastry brush. Gently dip your pastry brush into your yolk and liquid mixture and brush it over your dough before baking. You can use your egg wash to give a golden brown shine, stick 2 pieces of dough together, or make the outside of your baked goods crispy.[\[2\]](#_note-2)  
      
    *   You can buy a pastry brush online or at any home goods store.
3.  Bake your dough according to instructions. Each [pastry](https://www.wikihow.com/Bake-Cakes-and-Pastries "Bake Cakes and Pastries"), [bread](https://www.wikihow.com/Bake-Simple-Bread "Bake Simple Bread"), or [pie](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Pie "Make a Pie") has a different baking time, so you should bake yours for however long the recipe specifies. The egg wash will turn your dough a deeper brown than they normally would have been, so make sure that it is baked all the way through.[\[3\]](#_note-3)  
      
    

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Use-Egg-Yolks&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Creating a Custard")\]Creating a Custard

1.  Boil milk and sugar together in a large pot. Combine of milk and ¼ cup (50 g) of sugar by boiling them on the stove. Once your mixture reaches boiling, you can reduce the heat and keep it simmering.[\[4\]](#_note-4)  
      
    *   You’ll want to keep this mixture warm so that it combines well with the other ingredients.
2.  Whisk 4 egg yolks, sugar, and cornstarch together. Combine 4 egg yolks, ¼ cup (50 g) of sugar, and 3 ½ tbsp. (26.25 g) of cornstarch. Do this in a separate bowl from your milk and sugar mixture.[\[5\]](#_note-5)  
      
    *   Make sure that the cornstarch is completely folded into the mix, or else your custard could be lumpy.
3.  Pour your cornstarch mixture into your milk and sugar mixture. The milk and sugar should still be warm from simmering on the stove. You can combine your ingredients slowly to help them mix evenly and to avoid splashing.[\[6\]](#_note-6)  
      
    
4.  Stir the mixture for 3-5 minutes, or until it is thick. Your custard should start to thicken right away, but you are looking for a mayonnaise like consistency. Keep stirring it gently with a spoon until it gets slightly difficult to keep going. If you overcook your custard, you could cause it to curdle.[\[7\]](#_note-7)  
      
    *   If you have a thermometer, you can check to see when your custard is done when it reaches .
5.  Turn off your stove and add of butter. Butter thickens the custard and makes it less likely to fall apart while it is cooling. Stir this in gently so that you don’t overwork your custard mix.[\[8\]](#_note-8)  
      
    
6.  Add of vanilla extract. Vanilla extract will give your custard a flavor and make it sweeter. Vanilla is a more neutral flavor that pairs well with other dessert items, but you can also use flavors like almond extract, nutmeg, or fruit zest, like lemon or lime..[\[9\]](#_note-9)  
      
    
7.  Transfer the custard mixture to a separate container and let your custard cool. Put your custard in separate, air tight bowl or storage container to cool it. Once it cools to room temperature, you can serve it right away or put it in the fridge to save for later.[\[10\]](#_note-10)

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Use-Egg-Yolks&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Making Mayonnaise")\]Making Mayonnaise

1.  Mix together 1 egg yolk, white vinegar, and salt. Combine of white vinegar, ½ tsp. (3 g) of salt, and 1 egg yolk by putting your ingredients in a medium bowl and whisk them together until they are smooth, or for about 30 seconds. There should be no lumps and you should be able to run your whisk through evenly.[\[11\]](#_note-11)  
      
    *   You can add of lemon juice or mustard to your mixture for a more acidic taste.
2.  Add of canola oil to the mixture gradually. Pour your oil in at a time so that your ingredients mix evenly. It may be helpful to have a partner to pour in the oil while you mix, or vice versa.[\[12\]](#_note-12)  
      
    *   You can substitute extra virgin olive oil for canola oil if you prefer a more olive taste.
3.  Whisk your mixture for about 8 minutes. Your mayonnaise mixture should be thick and stick to your whisk, but still fall off if you lift your whisk out of the bowl.[\[13\]](#_note-13)  
      
    
4.  Chill your mayonnaise for about 1 hour. Cover your bowl with plastic wrap or put it in an airtight container and store it in the fridge to chill. This recipe makes about of mayonnaise and should be eaten within 1 week after you make it.[\[14\]](#_note-14)  
      
    

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Use-Egg-Yolks&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Storing Your Egg Yolks")\]Storing Your Egg Yolks

1.  Put your yolks in an airtight container to save for later. If you don’t want to use your egg yolks right away, you can store them in an airtight container in your fridge. A tupperware with a tight fitting lid or a bowl with plastic wrap on the top would be a great way to store your yolks.[\[15\]](#_note-15)  
      
    
    [![Use Egg Yolks Step 15.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e0/Use-Egg-Yolks-Step-15.jpg/aid11318963-v4-728px-Use-Egg-Yolks-Step-15.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Use-Egg-Yolks-Step-15.jpg)
    
    *   You should use your egg yolks within 2-4 days of storing them.
    *   If you are worried about your egg yolks drying out, you can cover them in cold water before you store them. Make sure to drain the water before you use your egg yolks again.
2.  Freeze your egg yolks with a simple syrup so they don’t crystalize. If you’d like to freeze your egg yolks to use at a later date, you can make a simple syrup by boiling 2 parts sugar and 1 part water until they are completely mixed. Then, pour the simple syrup into your egg yolks and freeze them. This will stop the egg yolks from flaking in your baked goods when you use them.[\[16\]](#_note-16)
    
    [![Use Egg Yolks Step 16.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f7/Use-Egg-Yolks-Step-16.jpg/aid11318963-v4-728px-Use-Egg-Yolks-Step-16.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Use-Egg-Yolks-Step-16.jpg)
    
    *   Frozen egg yolks should be used within 2 weeks.
3.  Cure your egg yolks in salt. You can make your egg into a hard consistency to save them and use them like a hard cheese later by grating them over pasta or vegetables. You can save salt cured eggs for up to one month before using them.[\[17\]](#_note-17)  
      
    *   Mix 1 cup (200 g) of sugar with 1 cup (288 g) of salt and spread the mixture on a baking tray.
    *   Set 4-6 egg yolks in the mixture and make sure they are fully covered in the salt and sugar.
