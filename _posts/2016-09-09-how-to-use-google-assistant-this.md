Just in time for Valentine’s Day, Google has launched a new way to use Assistant to get the romance started. Google has also published a list of ways to use Assistant to ensure this Valentine’s Day works out just the way you (or your partner) planned it.

Hey Google, Turn Up the Love
----------------------------

In a post on [The Keyword](https://www.blog.google/products/assistant/hey-google-turn-love/), Google spells out the many and varied ways Assistant can help your Valentine’s Day go well. The post was written by someone called Olive U. Somuch, which is clearly a real person and not just a made-up name in honor of Valentine’s.

The headline feature use Google Assistant to “transform your home from forgettable to festive”. All you need to say is “Hey Google, turn up the love”. Doing so will make the Assistant play smooth jazz music and turn your color-changing lights to red and purple.

This works with an “Assistant-enabled smart speaker or Smart Display, like \[the\] Nest Hub Max,” and is available in English all around the world. However, even if you don’t own a compatible device, there are other ways to use Google Assistant on Valentine’s Day.

Google lists a number of different ways to use the Assistant on Valentine’s Day. This includes, “Hey Google, play romantic music,” “Hey Google, show romantic dinner recipes,” “Hey Google, serenade me,” and “Hey Google, directions to a flower shop near me”.
