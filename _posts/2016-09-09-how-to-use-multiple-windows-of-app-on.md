The [iPadOS 13](https://www.howtogeek.com/423446/ipados-will-almost-make-your-ipad-a-real-computer/) update brings new window management features that almost turn the iPad into a laptop replacement. With it, you can open multiple windows of the same app. Here’s how this works on the iPad.

Create a New Window Using Drag and Drop
---------------------------------------

iPadOS 13 picks up where iOS 11’s drag-and-drop feature left off. In iOS 11, you could select elements, text, and links and then drop them into another app.

Now, you can do the same with parts of an app. This can be a note in the Notes app, an email in the Mail app, or a link in Safari. The simplest way to learn this new mechanism is by using Safari as an example.

Open a website in Safari, tap and hold on a link, and move your finger. You have just picked up a link.

Now, move your finger to the right edge of the screen untill you see a black bar and a Safari icon.

When you lift your finger, iPadOS will create a new Safari window with the link open.
