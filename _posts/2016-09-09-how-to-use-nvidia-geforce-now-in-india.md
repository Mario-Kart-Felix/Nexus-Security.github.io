Nvidia’s game streaming service [GeForce Now](https://beebom.com/what-is-nvidia-geforce-now/) has been in beta for quite some time, but now, the company has finally opened it for public access. However, the company is still limiting its [Stadia](https://beebom.com/play-google-stadia-games-any-android-phone/) competitor to the US so far. So, if you’re in India and you want to test out Nvidia’s take on the whole cloud-gaming concept, here’s how you can use Nvidia GeForce Now in India right now.  

What is GeForce Now
-------------------

  

First off, what is GeForce Now? Simply put, GeForce Now is a cloud game streaming service that lets users play high-end games on basically any computer or smartphone they have without worrying about the hardware inside their system. You can play [battle royale games](https://beebom.com/best-upcoming-battle-royale-games/) like [Apex Legends](https://beebom.com/apex-legends-tips-tricks/) on a MacBook or a low-end Windows laptop, or even an Android smartphone. All you really need is an account with GeForce Now, and a fast internet connection. If you have that, you’re all set to play your games wherever you like and on whatever device you want.  

In concept, this is similar to other options like Microsoft’s [Project xCloud, and Google Stadia](https://beebom.com/microsoft-project-xcloud-vs-google-stadia/). However, unlike Google Stadia, Nvidia isn’t restricting users to a very short list of devices anymore. You can use GeForce on [Windows](https://beebom.com/windows-10-1-billion-users/), [macOS](https://beebom.com/macos-catalina-features/), Nvidia Shield TV, and Android smartphones. The only thing missing so far is iOS, and I hope Nvidia adds that soon as well.  

How to Use GeForce Now in India
-------------------------------

  

So, now that we have a general idea about what GeForce Now is, let’s take a look at how you can use it in India right away. Here’s what you need to do.  

*   First up, download a VPN if you don’t already have one. You can choose one from our list of [best VPN apps for Windows](https://beebom.com/best-vpn-for-windows-10-pc/) and macOS if you want. For testing, I tried Tunnelbear and ExpressVPN and both of them worked perfectly fine.
  
*   Now, connect to a US server from your VPN app and head over to the [GeForce Now website](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/) to create your account. Click on “**Join Today**“, and **select the subscription tier** you want to use. I chose the “Free” tier for testing things out.

*   **Log in with your Nvidia account** if you have one, or **create a new account** like I did.
  

![nvidia geforce now create account](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nvidia-geforce-now-create-account.jpg)

*   Once you **verify your email**, you will be able to **download the GeForce Now app** for your platform of choice. Since I’m testing this on a Mac, I downloaded the GeForce Now app for macOS.
  

![geforce now client side apps](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/geforce-now-client-side-apps.jpg)

*   Launch the app, click on **Log In**, and log in with the account you just created.
  
*   You can now **search for games you own, or for the free to play titles** like Apex Legends (that’s the one I tested the service with) and add them to your GeForce Now library.

When you launch a game for the first time, GeForce Now might ask you to sign in with the account you use for the game. It will then check your network to ensure you get a seamless experience.

In my case, I was testing the service on our incredibly slow office WiFi with a VPN running on top of it. So I wasn’t really surprised when GeForce Now said that the network will support only 1280×800 at 30FPS streaming. Your mileage may vary depending on the WiFi speeds you have at your place, and the VPN service you’re using.

Play Your Favorite Games Anywhere with GeForce Now
--------------------------------------------------

  

So that’s basically it. You can now play any of the over 400 supported games on GeForce Now (although [GTA V isn’t on it](https://beebom.com/gta-5-ditches-nvidia-geforce-now-stadia/)) on any device you like. It’s pretty great. However bear in mind that since we’re using a VPN to access the service, you **might have to deal with higher than usual ping values**. I would recommend not playing multiplayer shooters until the service is actually available in India, otherwise you might get really annoyed with the latency here.  

Anyway, which games are you itching to play on your devices with GeForce Now? Let us know in the comments. Personally, I was stoked to see Apex Legends running on a MacBook Pro with such ease. After all, the list of [good Mac games](https://beebom.com/best-free-mac-games/) is fairly limited, so I’m definitely going to try this out more.
