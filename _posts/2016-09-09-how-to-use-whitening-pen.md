Despite what magazines and movies might lead you to believe, countless people deal with yellow teeth on a daily basis. While laser-whitening treatments and other professional procedures are expensive and inaccessible to many people, whitening pens offer an affordable option to those looking to brighten their teeth at home. After choosing the right product and cleaning your teeth ahead of time, you’re ready to apply the whitening pen to the surface of your teeth. Keep using this tool for at least a week to see if you notice any changes!

1.  Select a whitening product that is convenient for you. Familiarize yourself with ingredients that are in different whitening pens. While almost all products include peroxide, note that other pens require you to use teeth trays to set the whitening agent in place. Try choosing a product that best fits into your routine.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   Although they’re known to work slower than whitening pens, whitening strips are also an affordable option.
2.  Brush your teeth to ensure that they’re clean. Take 2 minutes to fully clean your teeth before applying any whitening product. Take extra care to brush the front surface of your teeth, as this is where the whitening pen will go. To develop a consistent routine, choose to use your whitening pen in the morning or evening so you can apply it right after you brush your teeth.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

3.  Floss your teeth to clean them more thoroughly. Make sure that your teeth are completely clean when you go to apply the whitening product. Use a strand of floss that’s long enough to wrap around both index fingers several times, creating a straight length of floss that’s at least long. Work your way between all of your teeth, prioritizing the gum line as you go.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

    *   If you don’t want to use regular floss, try using plastic flossers instead.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Use-a-Whitening-Pen&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Applying the Product")\]Applying the Product

1.  Open your mouth with your lips stretched away from your teeth. Spread your lips apart into a toothy smile with both your upper and lower teeth visible, as well as your gum lines. Hold this position whenever you use the whitening pen, as you don’t want your lips to move the product around.[\[4\]](#_note-4)
    
    [![Use a Whitening Pen Step 4.jpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5b/Use-a-Whitening-Pen-Step-4.jpeg/aid11418051-v4-728px-Use-a-Whitening-Pen-Step-4.jpeg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Use-a-Whitening-Pen-Step-4.jpeg)
    
    *   Whenever you whiten your teeth, be sure to work in front of a mirror.
2.  Brush on the product in short, vertical strokes along the surface of each tooth. Remove or unscrew the cap from the whitening pen to access the brush portion. Don’t worry about adding any product to the tip, as the bristle will already be coated in whitening formula. Apply the whitening product in short, vertical strokes, working from the top of the tooth to the bottom. Aim to paint over each tooth 3-5 times with the applicator.[\[5\]](#_note-5)
    
    [![Use a Whitening Pen Step 5.jpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/65/Use-a-Whitening-Pen-Step-5.jpeg/aid11418051-v4-728px-Use-a-Whitening-Pen-Step-5.jpeg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Use-a-Whitening-Pen-Step-5.jpeg)
    
    *   Twist the pen if the tip doesn’t seem to have any product on it.[\[6\]](#_note-6)
3.  Hold your mouth in place for 1 minute to set the product. Keep your lips pulled back and teeth visible for 1 minute after you finish applying the pen. Set a timer or count to 60 while you keep your mouth in this position. Try not to relax your mouth until you’ve waited for this amount of time.[\[7\]](#_note-7)

    *   As you wait, try to avoid swallowing the serum.
4.  Rinse out the whitening product with warm water. Spit out as much of the whitening agent as you can, then swish some warm water around your teeth to dislodge any excess product. Continue spitting until there’s no longer any whitener on your teeth.[\[8\]](#_note-8)

    *   If you think you’re able to spit out all of the product, don’t worry about swishing or gargling.
5.  Keep applying the product daily for at least 1 week. Read the instructions on your specific whitening pen to figure out when you’ll start seeing results. Continue using the pen once a day, directly after you brush and floss your teeth.[\[9\]](#_note-9) When you’re not using the pen, keep it stored in a cool, dry place.[\[10\]](#_note-10)

    *   Some products might not show results right away. Be patient, and continue using the pen for several weeks before deciding if it works or not.[\[11\]](#_note-11)
