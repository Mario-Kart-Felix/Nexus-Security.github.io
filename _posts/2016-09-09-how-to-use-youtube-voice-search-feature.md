Recently, [Google](https://beebom.com/google-page/) updated the YouTube app to introduce an all-new voice-search feature. What makes this feature so handy is that it makes searching for content pretty simple especially when casting YouTube videos to a [smart TV](https://beebom.com/best-4k-tvs-india/). Times when you are planning to watch an [exciting flick](https://beebom.com/best-family-movies-netflix/) but don’t know what will light up your show-time, this intuitive search feature can come into play really well. If you find it worth giving a shot, follow along as I show you how you can use YouTube’s new voice search feature when casting to a smart TV.
