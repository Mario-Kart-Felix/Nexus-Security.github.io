You downloaded pictures from your camera, phone, or USB drive. Now you want to share these galleries with friends and family in a nice presentation. This guide shows you how to view a slideshow on Windows 10 using native tools.

This guide explains two built-in methods: using the Photos app and using File Explorer. The benefit of the Photos app is that you have immediate access to other albums and folders without digging through File Explorer. Meanwhile, the File Explorer version provides built-in slideshow controls not present in the Photos app.

**Use the Photos App**
----------------------

Normally, all you need to do is double-click on an image file to launch the Photos app. If Photos isn’t set as the default image application on your computer, right-click on a photo, hover over “Open With,” and select “Photos.”

Once the app loads, you’ll see the static picture on your screen. Hover your mouse over the picture’s left or right side and you can advance or “rewind” to another image using the virtual arrow overlays.

To start a slideshow, click the three-dot button located in the top-right corner. This expands a drop-down menu listing a “Slideshow” option at the top. Click this option to start the show.

Once the slideshow begins, it will cycle through all images stored in the initial photo’s associated folder. The slideshow will not add pictures stored in sub-folders.

For controls, you can press the Right Arrow key to move to the next picture or press the Left Arrow key to rewind back to the previous image.
