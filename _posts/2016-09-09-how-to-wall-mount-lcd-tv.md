Mounting your LCD TV to your wall may seem challenging, but with the right tools, it’s a breeze. First, choose where you want to mount the TV and locate wall studs or install toggle snap anchors that you can use to support it. Then, install the mounting bracket to your wall and attach the mounting plate to the back of your TV. After that, connect the plate to the bracket on the wall, and kick back and enjoy your newly mounted TV!

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Choosing a Mounting Location")\]Choosing a Mounting Location

1.  Choose a wall where you want to place your TV. Pick a wall that allows the whole room to see the TV and will provide the best picture quality and won’t be affected by sunlight coming in from windows. You also need to consider the position of the furniture in the room and what direction they face.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   Because you need to screw holes into the wall to mount your LCD TV, be sure of your placement before you begin mounting it!
    *   In a living room, the center of the wall across from the main entranceway allows for a wider viewing angle.
2.  Position your TV so it’s at eye level. Place your TV on the wall where it’s most likely to be at eye level when you’re viewing it. If you plan to mostly watch it while sitting on the sofa you’ll want to place it lower than you would if you plan to mostly watch it while standing or at a bar. Use a ruler or tape measure to measure from the floor to the best height to put the TV at eye level and lightly mark the height with a pencil.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

    *   Placing your TV at off of the ground will put the screen at eye level with the average adult sitting down.
    *   If you plan to view the TV more often while standing, then mount it off of the ground.
    *   Mount the TV as close to eye level as possible if there’s an obstruction such as an existing appliance or piece of furniture.
3.  Select a location that allows you to conceal wires and devices. The cables and wires of your TV and any devices you plan to connect to it can be unsightly. When you’re picking a place to mount your TV, think about how difficult it will be for you to conceal them to help inform your decision.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

    *   Centering the TV on a bare wall in the center of the room may make it difficult for you to hide the wires.
    *   Use furniture placement to help conceal the wires.
4.  Move any furniture, pictures, or decor from the area. You need to have a clear area to work in when you’re mounting your LCD TV. Slide over any chairs, tables, or sofas so you can access the wall easily. Take down any paintings, pictures, or decor so they’re out of your way.[\[4\]](#_note-4)

    *   Gently place the items that were hanging on the wall nearby so you don’t crack or break them.
    *   Take down anything hanging on the wall so they can’t wobble, shake, or potentially fall when you’re drilling into the wall.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Installing the Mounting Bracket")\]Installing the Mounting Bracket

1.  Line up the mounting bracket and mark where you plan to drill. Hold up the mount against the wall where you want to place the TV and use a level to make sure it’s straight. Then, take a pencil and lightly mark where you need to drill holes to mount the bracket to the wall.[\[5\]](#_note-5)
    
    [![Wall Mount an LCD TV Step 5 Version 6.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/67/Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-5-Version-6.jpg/aid714251-v4-728px-Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-5-Version-6.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-5-Version-6.jpg)
    
    *   Make a pencil mark on the wall through the screw holes on the mounting bracket.
    *   Set the bracket aside until you’re ready to mount it.
2.  [Find wall studs](https://www.wikihow.com/Find-a-Stud "Find a Stud") in the area with a stud finder. Look for studs in the area you plan to mount your LCD TV so you can install the framework into them. Take a stud finder and run the tool across the wall at the height you plan to mount the TV to locate studs you can use.[\[6\]](#_note-6)
    
    [![Wall Mount an LCD TV Step 6 Version 6.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f2/Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-6-Version-6.jpg/aid714251-v4-728px-Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-6-Version-6.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-6-Version-6.jpg)
    
    *   Use a pencil to lightly mark the location of a stud on the wall.
    *   You can purchase stud finders at hardware stores, department stores, and online.
3.  Use a masonry bit to drill pilot holes into the marked areas. Fit a masonry bit into the end of your power drill. Drill pilot holes into the wall where you marked the locations of the screw holes with your pencil.[\[7\]](#_note-7)
    
    [![Wall Mount an LCD TV Step 7 Version 6.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/92/Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-7-Version-6.jpg/aid714251-v4-728px-Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-7-Version-6.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-7-Version-6.jpg)
    
    *   The pilot holes will make it easier for you to install the screws that will support the mounting bracket.
    *   Make sure you drill into a wall stud so the brackets are supported.
4.  Insert toggle snap anchors if there aren’t any studs. Toggle snap anchors are plastic devices you can insert into your wall that will help support your TV if there aren’t any studs. Use a drill bit to drill holes into the wall where you need to install the snap anchors to mount the bracket. Push the snap anchors into the holes so they’re secure.[\[8\]](#_note-8)
    
    [![Wall Mount an LCD TV Step 8 Version 6.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/76/Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-8-Version-6.jpg/aid714251-v4-728px-Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-8-Version-6.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-8-Version-6.jpg)
    
    *   Make sure all of the toggle snap anchor is fully inserted into the wall.
5.  Line up the mounting bracket up with the pilot holes or toggle snap anchors. After you drill all of the pilot holes or install the toggle snap anchors, replace the bit with a screwdriver bit that fits the mounting screws. Hold up the mounting bracket to the wall and line up the screw holes with the pilot holes or toggle snap anchors.[\[9\]](#_note-9)
    
    [![Wall Mount an LCD TV Step 9 Version 6.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/bf/Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-9-Version-6.jpg/aid714251-v4-728px-Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-9-Version-6.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-9-Version-6.jpg)
    
    *   Hold the bracket so it’s flush against the wall.
6.  Drill the mounting screws into the pilot holes or toggle snap anchors. Apply pressure against the bracket to hold it flush against the wall. Then, drill the mounting screws through the screw holes of the bracket and into the pilot holes that you drilled or the toggle snap anchors that you installed.[\[10\]](#_note-10)
    
    [![Wall Mount an LCD TV Step 10.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/17/Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-10.jpg/aid714251-v4-728px-Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-10.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-10.jpg)
    
    *   Drill the screws all the way into the stud or anchor so they secure the bracket.
    *   Wiggle the bracket to make sure it’s secure and tighten the screws if there’s any movement.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Attaching the TV to the Bracket")\]Attaching the TV to the Bracket

1.  Locate the mounting plate attachment holes on the back of your TV. On the back of your LCD TV are holes that correspond to the screw holes on the mounting plate. If there are already screws in the holes, remove them so you can attach the plate.[\[11\]](#_note-11)
    
    [![Wall Mount an LCD TV Step 11.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/53/Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-11.jpg/aid714251-v4-728px-Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-11.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-11.jpg)
    
    *   They may also be covered in plastic if you just bought your TV.
2.  Attach the mounting plate to your TV. Fit the screws through the screw holes of the mounting plate and into the corresponding holes on the TV. After you slide the screws through the slots, attach the nuts to the screws and tighten them so the mounting plate is flush against the back of the TV.[\[12\]](#_note-12)
    
    [![Wall Mount an LCD TV Step 12.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e6/Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-12.jpg/aid714251-v4-728px-Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-12.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-12.jpg)
    
    *   The mounting plate will support the TV on the bracket, so make sure the nuts are tight on the screws!
    *   Give the mounting plate a good shake to make sure there isn’t any movement. If there is, tighten up the nuts on the screws.
3.  Line up the mounting plate with the bracket on the wall. Pick up the TV and hold it up to the mounting bracket on the wall. Align the mounting plate on the back of the TV with the slot that the plate will fit into on the bracket.[\[13\]](#_note-13)
    
    [![Wall Mount an LCD TV Step 13.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d6/Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-13.jpg/aid714251-v4-728px-Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-13.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-13.jpg)
    
    *   Use another person to help you hold the TV up against the wall.
4.  Connect the mounting plate to the bracket. Depending on the mounting plate and bracket that you have, you may need to slide the plate into a slot on the bracket. You may also need to screw the mounting plate to the bracket. Check the manufacturer's instructions to make sure you’re connecting the plate to the bracket correctly.[\[14\]](#_note-14)
    
    [![Wall Mount an LCD TV Step 14.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e4/Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-14.jpg/aid714251-v4-728px-Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-14.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-14.jpg)
    
5.  Conceal the cables with a cord cover. A cord cover is a plastic track that mounts directly to the wall on top of the wires to hide them. Use screws to mount the base to the wall beneath your TV and lay the cords inside of them. Then, snap the plastic cover in place on top of it.[\[15\]](#_note-15)
    
    [![Wall Mount an LCD TV Step 15.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c5/Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-15.jpg/aid714251-v4-728px-Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-15.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Wall-Mount-an-LCD-TV-Step-15.jpg)
    
    *   Choose a cord cover color that blends into your wall so it’s less noticeable.
    *   You can remove the top of the cover at any time if you need to adjust or add additional wires.
6.  Finished.
