1.  Play around with colors and styles for a laidback vibe. Don’t feel like you have to stick with the traditional red and black or blue and black flannel shirts. You can easily find flannel shirts in all sorts of colors and washes. Try a distressed, acid-washed flannel for an edgy look or opt for a flannel shirt in pastel colors for a softer option.

2.  Create an effortless outfit by wearing a flannel with a T-shirt and jeans. This is probably the most popular way to style a flannel shirt. Simply toss on a T-shirt and layer your favorite flannel over top. Choose a graphic tee to make a statement or a plain tee for a more traditional approach. Any style of jeans will look great, from more relaxed fits to skinny jeans.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   Tuck in your T-shirt for a more refined look or leave it untucked for a laid-back vibe.
    *   A red and black flannel, white T-shirt, and blue jeans is a classic outfit that works well for both men and women.
3.  Bring back '90s grunge style by tying a flannel around your waist. Throwback to the heyday of alternative rock by adding a flannel to your most worn-in and comfortable T-shirt and jeans. Tie the flannel around your waist and head out the door.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

    *   Complete the look with Converse sneakers or combat boots and sunglasses.
4.  Run errands in a cozy flannel and leggings or joggers. Whether you’re headed to the mall or the market, it’s easy to create a simple but stylish outfit. Button up a flannel shirt and put on a pair of leggings or joggers in a matching neutral color.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

    *   Toss on some sneakers or boots and finish up the look with a baseball cap or beanie.
5.  Layer your flannel with warm outerwear for cold, wintery days. Flannel is a cold-weather fabric and looks great underneath sweaters and coats. Add a heavy winter jacket, a leather moto jacket, or a puffy fall vest for a great outdoorsy look.[\[4\]](#_note-4)

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Wear-Flannel-Shirts&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Dressing up Your Flannel Shirts")\]Dressing up Your Flannel Shirts

1.  Stick to neutral colors for work and dressier functions. Though flannel shirts are available in a wide array of colors and washes and even come distressed, stick with the more classic versions if you want to dress up. Choose traditional prints with colors like red, black, gray, blue, green, and white.[\[5\]](#_note-5)
    
    [![Wear Flannel Shirts Step 6.jpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e0/Wear-Flannel-Shirts-Step-6.jpeg/aid856002-v4-728px-Wear-Flannel-Shirts-Step-6.jpeg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Wear-Flannel-Shirts-Step-6.jpeg)
    
2.  Pair a tucked-in flannel shirt with corduroy pants for an office-friendly look. You can look stylish and trendy in a flannel shirt while still staying comfortable. Rather than pairing your shirt with jeans, opt for corduroys to take this outfit to the next level.[\[6\]](#_note-6)
    
    [![Wear Flannel Shirts Step 7.jpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b7/Wear-Flannel-Shirts-Step-7.jpeg/aid856002-v4-728px-Wear-Flannel-Shirts-Step-7.jpeg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Wear-Flannel-Shirts-Step-7.jpeg)
    
    *   Complete this retro look with a pair of pumps and a matching handbag. Or, add a pair of Oxfords or brogues and grab your briefcase before heading to the office.
3.  Be a trendsetter by wearing a flannel shirt under a suit jacket or blazer. Button up your flannel and add a blazer or jacket on top for a polished look. Slip into a pair of dress pants, add some loafers or heels, and you’re good to go.[\[7\]](#_note-7)
    
    [![Wear Flannel Shirts Step 8.jpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/56/Wear-Flannel-Shirts-Step-8.jpeg/aid856002-v4-728px-Wear-Flannel-Shirts-Step-8.jpeg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Wear-Flannel-Shirts-Step-8.jpeg)
    
    *   For a formal look, pair a light-colored flannel print with a solid grey or blue suit and a thin, solid tie that matches the suit.
    *   To create a smart business casual outfit, layer a darker flannel with a blue or brown blazer and wear it with a pair of office-friendly tan or brown chinos.
4.  Wear a flannel with a solid-colored skirt for a night out on the town. Depending on your style and your plans for the night, you can wear your favorite flannel shirt with a long, dark-colored skirt or with a fun and flirty mini-skirt. Make the look sexier by leaving several buttons undone on the shirt and pairing it with some brightly-colored heels.[\[8\]](#_note-8)

    *   Stick to 2 contrasting colors to really make this outfit pop. For example, you could choose a red and black flannel print, a black skirt, red shoes, and a black handbag.
5.  Show up for a day date in a flannel shirt and chinos. For a classic and refined day-date look, select a freshly-pressed flannel shirt and pair it with crisp chinos. If you want to look more relaxed, leave the shirt untucked. As long as it’s wrinkle-free, it will still look nice enough for a day picking apples or walking in the park.[\[9\]](#_note-9)

    *   A brown and black flannel, tan chinos, and brown Chelsea boots make for a great date outfit.

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Wear-Flannel-Shirts&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Accessorizing Your Outfit")\]Accessorizing Your Outfit

1.  Put on sneakers or boots for casual styles. Converse shoes are a great match for flannel shirts. Several styles of boots, from combat boots to knee-high boots with heels, also work well. Opt for shoes in neutral colors so your flannel shirt is the star of the show.[\[10\]](#_note-10)
    
    [![Wear Flannel Shirts Step 11.jpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/00/Wear-Flannel-Shirts-Step-11.jpeg/aid856002-v4-728px-Wear-Flannel-Shirts-Step-11.jpeg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Wear-Flannel-Shirts-Step-11.jpeg)
    
    *   Avoid sandals or strappy shoes, as they’ll contrast with the cold-weather feel that flannel shirts have.
2.  Wear heels or loafers to dress up your outfit. If you’re sporting a flannel to the office or for a date, choose a dressier shoe to complete your look. Pumps, loafers, Oxfords, or brogues are great choices.[\[11\]](#_note-11)
    
    [![Wear Flannel Shirts Step 12.jpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/dd/Wear-Flannel-Shirts-Step-12.jpeg/aid856002-v4-728px-Wear-Flannel-Shirts-Step-12.jpeg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Wear-Flannel-Shirts-Step-12.jpeg)
    
3.  Top off your look with a baseball cap or beanie. Flannel shirts pair well with hats, especially for casual looks. Stick with a baseball cap in the warmer months or choose a beanie if the weather is colder. You could even add a straw or cowboy hat if the occasion calls for it.[\[12\]](#_note-12)
    
    [![Wear Flannel Shirts Step 13.jpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/7d/Wear-Flannel-Shirts-Step-13.jpeg/aid856002-v4-728px-Wear-Flannel-Shirts-Step-13.jpeg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Wear-Flannel-Shirts-Step-13.jpeg)
    
    *   A blue beanie, blue and green flannel shirt, jeans, and boots make for a smart, cozy outfit.
4.  Add a pair of suspenders for a chic look. Tuck your flannel shirt into a pair of jeans or chinos and strap on a pair of suspenders to create an outfit that’s perfect for a crisp fall day. Add a pair of boots or Brogues to finish it off.
    
    [![Wear Flannel Shirts Step 14.jpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a1/Wear-Flannel-Shirts-Step-14.jpeg/aid856002-v4-728px-Wear-Flannel-Shirts-Step-14.jpeg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Wear-Flannel-Shirts-Step-14.jpeg)
    
5.  Opt for understated jewelry rather than statement pieces. A simple necklace or bracelet are the perfect accessories for a flannel shirt. Avoid large or gaudy jewelry which could make your outfit look too busy.[\[13\]](#_note-13)
    
    [![Wear Flannel Shirts Step 15.jpeg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e1/Wear-Flannel-Shirts-Step-15.jpeg/aid856002-v4-728px-Wear-Flannel-Shirts-Step-15.jpeg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Wear-Flannel-Shirts-Step-15.jpeg)
    
    *   A pastel flannel over a white tank top, a denim mini-skirt, and a few bangle bracelets would look great for a movie date.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   When choosing a shirt or jacket to your flannel, pick one in a hue from the plaid pattern. This will keep your look uniform and crisp.
*   Flannel comes in a single nap (one side is brushed/soft) and a double nap (both sides are brushed/soft). For warmer wear, choose a double nap flannel shirt over a single nap.
