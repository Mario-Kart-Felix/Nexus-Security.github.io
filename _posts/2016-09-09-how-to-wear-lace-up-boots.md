1.  Add tall socks to your boots for a pop of color. If your boots are black or brown and you’d like to throw in a pop of color on top of them, [wear tall socks](https://www.wikihow.com/Wear-Socks-with-Boots "Wear Socks with Boots") that will peak between your boots and pants. If you want to keep a classic look, opt for neutral and toned-down colors, like black, white, or beige.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   Some stores sell socks that are specifically made for boots. These are usually thicker and will be easier to pull out of the top of your shoes.
2.  Tie your boots tightly for a comfortable walking shoe. Lace up boots are used for fashion and function. If you want to take a hike in your boots or are planning a long walk, make sure that your boots are [tied snugly](https://www.wikihow.com/Lace-Boots "Lace Boots") and fit on your feet well. This will cause less strain on your feet over time.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

3.  Keep your shoelaces loose for a relaxed look. Some boots have shoelaces that can be tied loosely or not at all and still stay on your feet. If you want to look relaxed and fashionable, keep your shoelaces loose and your boots slightly floppy when you wear them.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

1.  Wear your boots with a dress and tights for semi-formal events. Heeled lace up boots can be paired [with a dress](https://www.wikihow.com/Wear-Ankle-Boots-With-Dresses "Wear Ankle Boots With Dresses") if you're going somewhere that calls for a little more formality. Add a pair of tights to elevate your outfit and make it formal enough to wear to weddings, dances, and parties while still allowing for the comfort of a boot.[\[7\]](#_note-7)

    *   Wearing oversized clothing can overwhelm your frame if you are petite.
3.  Create a sleek look by pairing your boots with skinny jeans. The contrast between the chunky wedges and the sleek, straight line of [skinny jeans](https://www.wikihow.com/Wear-Skinny-Jeans-with-Ankle-Boots "Wear Skinny Jeans with Ankle Boots") creates a dynamic outline that you'll look great in! Choose a dark-wash pair of skinny jeans to go with neutral lace up boots that have a wedge heel.[\[9\]](#_note-9)

4.  Elongate your legs with high-waisted jeans. Heeled boots are going to add length to your legs, but if you want your legs to look even longer, pairing your high heel lace up boots with high-waisted jeans will do just that. Choose jeans that go up to your belly button and wear them with your lace up boots.[\[10\]](#_note-10)

1.  Emphasize your legs by wearing a midi dress or skirt. Midi dresses and skirts hit at mid thigh, which means your legs and your boots will be accentuated. Wear your lace up knee high boots with a dress or skirt to events where you want to look both casual and stylish, like birthday parties or housewarming get-togethers.[\[11\]](#_note-11)
    
    [![Wear Lace Up Boots Step 11.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c3/Wear-Lace-Up-Boots-Step-11.jpg/aid11413840-v4-728px-Wear-Lace-Up-Boots-Step-11.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Wear-Lace-Up-Boots-Step-11.jpg)
    
    *   Knee high boots with midi dresses and skirts are not quite formal enough for very fancy events.
2.  Pair your knee high lace up boots with jeans to cover up. If you like the look of knee high lace up boots but you don’t want to show off a ton of leg, pull them on over a pair of your favorite skinny jeans. Your boots will still accentuate your legs, but you’ll stay covered up.[\[12\]](#_note-12)
    
    [![Wear Lace Up Boots Step 12.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c4/Wear-Lace-Up-Boots-Step-12.jpg/aid11413840-v4-728px-Wear-Lace-Up-Boots-Step-12.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Wear-Lace-Up-Boots-Step-12.jpg)
    
3.  Show off your boots while staying warm by wearing an overcoat. If it’s the winter time but you still want to use your boots to make a statement, pair them with a large overcoat that stops just above the top of your boots. People will still be able to see them as you walk, and it will be the first thing they notice as they see you.[\[13\]](#_note-13)
    
    [![Wear Lace Up Boots Step 13.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e6/Wear-Lace-Up-Boots-Step-13.jpg/aid11413840-v4-728px-Wear-Lace-Up-Boots-Step-13.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Wear-Lace-Up-Boots-Step-13.jpg)
    
    *   Try to get an overcoat that isn’t the same exact color as your boots, or it could wash you out.
4.  Mix comfort and fashion by wearing your boots over leggings. Lace up boots are great to pull on over [tight-fitting leggings](https://www.wikihow.com/Wear-Leggings "Wear Leggings"). Wear patterned leggings with neutral colored boots, or mix it up and add a pop of color with a bright pair of lace up boots.[\[14\]](#_note-14)
