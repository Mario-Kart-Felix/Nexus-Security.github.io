Red is a striking and classic color that can brighten up any outfit. It is the perfect choice for a date, a formal event or casual outing. Choose a shade of red that brings your complexion to life. Pair your red clothes with neutral colors for a formal look, or with clashing colors for a fun and trendy look. Add extra color to your outfit by wearing red accessories.

1.  Choose a shade of red that compliments your skin tone. If you have olive or darker skin, you’ll look great in an orangey red, like coral or tangerine. If you have a fair complexion, look for reds that are slightly more pink, such as ruby red or berry red. If your skin is a medium shade, you will probably look good in most shades.

    *   If you notice that your skin looks particularly good in a shade of red, you’ve probably found your best color match.
2.  Pair red with black or white to create a smart, business look. Red, black, and white are bold colors that create a striking contrast when paired together. This is a good option if you want to achieve a formal look for an event or for work. A red dress shirt with a black tie and a black suit makes a striking contrast that exudes power and confidence.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   Choose a bright shade of red if want to create a really sharp look.
    *   If you feel shy wearing bold red, look for black or white shirts that have red prints or patterns on them.
    *   Wear a red dress with a black or white blazer for a formal event.
3.  Wear red from head to toe if you want to stand out. Wearing red from head to toe is very on trend. If you are feeling really bold, wear red shoes, red trousers, and a red shirt. This outfit would be perfect for a fashion show or a trip to the city.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

    *   Choose different shades of red to help break the outfit up.
    *   If you like to blend in with the crowd, you may want to pick a muted shade rather than a bold one.
4.  Combine red with mustard, pink, or silver to create an on-trend look. Currently, pairing red with contrasting colors is a trendy look. Wear a red item of clothing with an item that clashes. A mustard or pink sweater paired with red flared trousers is a bold choice.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

    *   This style works best for block colours. Wear a top that is completely red or mustard, rather than a top that has a mustard and red pattern.
    *   Pair red with light blue to create a slightly less bold, but still trendy look.
    *   You may want to avoid this look if you are going to a formal work event.
5.  Wear a red dress if you want to create a classic and feminine look. Red dresses are a fun way to wear red because you can style them in so many different ways.
