### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Win-at-the-Game-Risk&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Conquering and Keeping Territories")\]Conquering and Keeping Territories

1.  Conquer continents wisely. While it is good to try to conquer continents early in the game, you should be careful about which continents you decide to conquer. There are advantages and disadvantages to each continent, but the main thing to consider is the isolation of a continent. More isolated continents may be easier to maintain, but they are also more difficult to expand from. Therefore, you should choose a continent that is in line with your strategy.[\[1\]](#_note-1)

    *   For example, Australia is easy to conquer and maintain because of how isolated it is, but it is also hard to expand from Australia and you may fall prey to more powerful plays later in the game. For these reasons, conquering Australia may offer you an advantage, but only if you feel capable of overcoming its disadvantage.
2.  Pay attention to the army bonus that you get for each continent. Some continents are much more beneficial to hold than others because you will get a better army bonus each turn. Before you begin trying to conquer a continent, find out how many armies you will get as a bonus for holding that continent. For example, Europe gives you a bonus of 5 armies per turn for holding the continent, while Africa gives you a bonus of 3 armies per turn.[\[2\]](#_note-2)

    *   Keep in mind that Europe and North America are the most beneficial continents to hold because they give you the best army bonuses. Try to hold one of these continents if you can.
3.  Attack with the right amount of armies. Knowing how many armies to use in an attack on an opponent can be a big boost to your chances of winning. A good general rule in attacking an enemy territory is to use twice as many armies as your opponent has on the territory you want to attack. This will increase your chances of winning and overtaking the territory. Keep in mind that you will need to move these armies to an adjacent territory before you begin your attack.[\[3\]](#_note-3)

    *   For example, if an opponent has two armies on a territory that you want, then you should attack that territory with at least four armies.
4.  Determine how many armies to keep on each territory. In most cases, you will benefit from having most of your armies on your border territories. Concentrating your armies in this way helps to reduce the chances that you will have a weak spot and be overtaken by an opponent. The territories within your borders can have fewer armies, but try to avoid having a single weak spot that an opponent may try to target.[\[4\]](#_note-4)

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Win-at-the-Game-Risk&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Dealing with Your Opponents")\]Dealing with Your Opponents

1.  Count your opponents’ armies at the end of each turn. It is a good idea to keep track of how many armies your opponents have by counting them after every turn. Doing so will help you to determine who is the weakest and who is the strongest player at all times.[\[5\]](#_note-5)
    
    [![Win at the Game Risk Step 5 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/32/Win-at-the-Game-Risk-Step-5-Version-3.jpg/aid168018-v4-728px-Win-at-the-Game-Risk-Step-5-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Win-at-the-Game-Risk-Step-5-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   Try not to count out loud or let your opponents see you counting their armies or they may become suspicious of you.
2.  Block opponent territories within your own territories. If you get the opportunity to surround an opponent’s territory with your territories, take it. Doing so will allow you to conquer that territory without fear of immediate retaliation. Blocking in an opponent’s territory will also prevent your other opponents from conquering a territory that you want.[\[6\]](#_note-6)
    
    [![Win at the Game Risk Step 6 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/00/Win-at-the-Game-Risk-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/aid168018-v4-728px-Win-at-the-Game-Risk-Step-6-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Win-at-the-Game-Risk-Step-6-Version-3.jpg)
    
3.  Nail neighboring contents to prevent them from becoming too powerful. If one of your opponents is becoming strong and/or is close to conquering an entire continent, then you may want to consider a nailing strategy to slow him or her down. Nailing is when you place a large force on an opponent’s continent to disrupt his or her strategy. Doing so will slow the opponent down and prevent him or her from advancing too quickly.[\[7\]](#_note-7)
    
    [![Win at the Game Risk Step 7 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/ba/Win-at-the-Game-Risk-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/aid168018-v4-728px-Win-at-the-Game-Risk-Step-7-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Win-at-the-Game-Risk-Step-7-Version-3.jpg)
    
4.  Form an alliance with a player of equivalent strength. Alliances are very helpful in _Risk_. When you form an alliance with a fellow player, you can team up against other stronger opponents and have more success in your conquests. Just keep in mind that you may have to fight against each other if you both survive to the end of the game, so the alliance is a temporary measure.[\[8\]](#_note-8)
    
    [![Win at the Game Risk Step 8 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d4/Win-at-the-Game-Risk-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/aid168018-v4-728px-Win-at-the-Game-Risk-Step-8-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Win-at-the-Game-Risk-Step-8-Version-2.jpg)
    
5.  Try to earn your fellow players’ trust. If you are deceptive or dishonest, your fellow players may target you more often or be reluctant to negotiate with you. Therefore, it is in your best interest to be honest and try to earn your fellow players’ trust. [Avoid lying](https://www.wikihow.com/Stop-Lying "Stop Lying") or making and breaking promises, especially early on in the game.[\[9\]](#_note-9)
    
    [![Win at the Game Risk Step 9 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/09/Win-at-the-Game-Risk-Step-9-Version-3.jpg/aid168018-v4-728px-Win-at-the-Game-Risk-Step-9-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Win-at-the-Game-Risk-Step-9-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   If you often play with the same people, keep in mind that they may remember past deceitful practices in future games that you play with them.
6.  Negotiate with your opponents whenever possible. If you and some other players are competing for a group of territories, then you may end up battling it out until one of you is out of the game. Instead of fighting with a neighboring player over land, try to negotiate with that player to reduce your chances of getting wiped out early in the game.[\[10\]](#_note-10)
    
    [![Win at the Game Risk Step 10 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a7/Win-at-the-Game-Risk-Step-10-Version-3.jpg/aid168018-v4-728px-Win-at-the-Game-Risk-Step-10-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Win-at-the-Game-Risk-Step-10-Version-3.jpg)
    
    *   Try to make a treaty with another player. For example, if you have the majority of your armies on Africa and another player has the majority of his or her armies on South America, then you can agree to leave each other alone until you have both had a chance to expand your territories to the north.[\[11\]](#_note-11)

### \[[Edit](https://www.wikihow.com/index.php?title=Win-at-the-Game-Risk&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Improving Your Game")\]Improving Your Game

1.  Make sure that you understand the rules. If you are new to _Risk_, then gaining a thorough understanding of the rules may help you to play a better game.

Read the rulebook carefully to make sure that you have a good understanding of how to play Risk.

2.  Play often and with more experienced players. The more you play, the more you will be able to work on your game strategy, so play as often as you can. It is also a good idea to try to play with more experienced players who are willing to share their knowledge with you.
    
    [![Win at the Game Risk Step 12 Version 3.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/24/Win-at-the-Game-Risk-Step-12-Version-3.jpg/aid168018-v4-728px-Win-at-the-Game-Risk-Step-12-Version-3.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Win-at-the-Game-Risk-Step-12-Version-3.jpg)
    
3.  Use the three basic strategies described in the _Risk_ rulebook. The _Risk_ rulebook offers three strategies for players that may help you when you are just getting familiar with the game. Try to use these strategies every time that you play the game and your game will improve. The three pieces of strategic advice given to players by the _Risk_ rulebook include:[\[12\]](#_note-12)
    
    [![Win at the Game Risk Step 13 Version 2.jpg](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2e/Win-at-the-Game-Risk-Step-13-Version-2.jpg/aid168018-v4-728px-Win-at-the-Game-Risk-Step-13-Version-2.jpg)](https://www.wikihow.com/Image:Win-at-the-Game-Risk-Step-13-Version-2.jpg)
    
    *   Hold entire continents to earn bonus reinforcements. The more army reinforcements that you have, the more powerful you are. Therefore, you should try to get as main reinforcements as possible.
    *   Watch your borders for enemy armies. If one of your opponent’s is going to attack you, he or she will probably start to gather forces along one of your borders.
    *   Fortify your borders against enemy attack. Make sure that you place reinforcements along your borders to make it harder for enemies to penetrate your territory.
