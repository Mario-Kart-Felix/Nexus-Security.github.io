Just a couple of weeks after [launching the 47.2mm version](https://beebom.com/huami-amazfit-gtr-launched-india-price-specs-features/) of its **Amazfit GTR smartwatch** in India, Huami has launched the **42.6mm version** of the device in the country. In a press release on Wednesday, the Xiaomi-backed Chinese firm said that the device will be offered in _“attractive designs and multi-color variations for women”_. The device was originally unveiled last July [alongside a Swarovski Edition](https://beebom.com/amazfit-gtr-heart-rate-tracker-battery-life/) with crystal encrusted bezels, although, that doesn’t seem to have made its way to India.  

Amazfit GTR 42.6mm Features and Specifications
----------------------------------------------

  

The smaller iteration of the Amazfit GTR comes with a 1.2-inch (390×390) display instead of the 1.39-inch (454 x 454) panel on its bigger compatriot. Another notable difference is the battery, which differs significantly between the two models. While the bigger one comes with a 410mAh LiPo battery with up to 24-days battery life, the newly-launched device carries a 195mAh LiPo battery with only up to 12-days battery life.  

Apart from that, the hardware specs and software features remain almost identical for the most part, including Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection and compatibility with devices running Android 5.0 or above and iOS 10 or higher. The GTR also comes with 5ATM certification, which means it is **waterproof up to a depth of 50 meters**. The device comes with twelve sports modes, including swimming, walking, running, climbing, skiing, trail running, mountaineering, workout and more.  

It also has BioTracker PPG bio-optical sensors for **24-hour heart rate monitoring**. There’s also sedentary reminder, all-day health monitoring, sleep analysis and other advanced health features. Connectivity options include Bluetooth 5.0 LE and GPS+GLONASS. While the Chinese model also gets an NFC chip, there’s no mention of that in the Indian model. Sensors include a 6-Axis Accelerometer, a 3 Axial Geomagnetic sensor, an air pressure sensor, a Capacitive sensor and an Ambient Light sensor.  

Amazfit GTR 42.6mm Price and Availability
-----------------------------------------

  

**The Amazfit GTR 42.6mm is priced at Rs. 9,999**, which is significantly higher than its 799 yuan (around Rs, 8,000) price-tag in China. Like its bigger sibling, it will also be [available exclusively on Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com/huami-amazfit-gtr-42-mm-starry-black-smartwatch/p/itm7ae6741c71a78?pid=SMWFJHNYJHPZ26BH), but unlike the former which is already available for purchase, this one will go on sale as part of the e-tailer’s upcoming Big Billion Days festive sale next week. It will be offered in starry black, cherry blossom pink, moonlight white and coral red colors with silicone straps, said Huami.
