After unveiling its Android 10-based custom Android skin, [EMUI 10](https://beebom.com/huawei-announces-emui-10-rollout-p30-series/), at its developer conference in China last month, Huawei announced that the new software will be rolled out to a number of its Huawei and Honor smartphones, starting with the P30-series. Now, the company has announced the rollout timeline for 33 Huawei and Honor devices that will be part of the EMUI 10 beta program. The company also said it will add more devices to the list in the days ahead.
