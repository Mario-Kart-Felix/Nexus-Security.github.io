![](https://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Huawei-Kirin.jpg) HUAWEI introduced its latest Kirin 990 7nm and Kirin 990 5G 7nm EUV Octa-Core SoCs at the IFA last month, and these are used in the Mate 30 series that were launched a few weeks back. Now, details about the next-generation Kirin 1000 SoC have surfaced. According to the latest rumor, HUAWEI has started working on Kirin 1000 SoC that will use 5nm process technology, compared to 7nm process technology in the Kirin 990. It is said to be based on ARM Cortex-A77 architecture, compared to A76 in the current SoC, and it could also use Mali-G77 GPU compared to Mali-G76. It is expected to debut in the HUAWEI Mate 40 series that should be introduced in Q3 2020. This will likely come in both 4G and 5G versions, feature improved Da Vinci-based NPU and improvement in energy efficiency and savings in bandwidth in high-bandwidth scenarios compared to Kirin 990. We can also expect faster download and upload speeds for both 4G and LTE. We should know more details about the Kirin 1000 in the coming months. Source
