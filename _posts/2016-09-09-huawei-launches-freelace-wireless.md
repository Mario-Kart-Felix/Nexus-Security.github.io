The launch comes as part of the company’s Diwali sale, which kicked off recently, offering a hoard of discounts on phones, wearables, and a lot more.

As you can see in the image above, Huawei FreeLace earphones sport a neckband-style design with a flexible memory metal cable (nickel-Titanium alloy and silicone). FreeLace earphones come packed with 9.2 mm dynamic driver units, which will offer great sound quality and “surging” bass, as per Huawei. It supports magnetic switch feature (works using Huawei’s HiPair technology) to automatically pair with a smartphone and pause or play music – similar to Bullets Wireless, wind noise reduction, and IPx5 water and sweat resistance among other things.  

Huawei promises 18-hour music playback on a complete charge, thanks to the 120mAh battery onboard. It has fast-charge support, via the USB Type-C port on board, and can provide up to 4 hours of playback.

Huawei Mini speaker weighs only 101 gm and will enable you to listen to music on the move while traveling. Its light and compact body make it the perfect travel companion, says Huawei. It has a minimalist design with only a power button and status LED light.  

As for the audio experience, Huawei has **baked 40mm drivers inside to provide a 3W audio output** with this Mini speaker, offering a loud and clear sound with deep bass. One can create a 360-degree stereo audio experience by pairing two speakers. The speaker is IPX4 rated for daily water and sweat resistance, which only adds to the appeal.  

Price and Availability
----------------------

  

Huawei FreeLace wireless earbuds are not competing against the Mi Neckband Bluetooth earphones or Realme Wireless Buds. Instead, it’s gunning for OnePlus Bullets Wireless 2 with Rs. 4,999 price tag, available exclusively on [Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com/huawei-freelace-bluetooth-headset-mic/p/itm79654fb96fbbd?pid=ACCFKDVHYGFK96YQ&lid=LSTACCFKDVHYGFK96YQSSO9ZB&marketplace=FLIPKART&srno=s_1_1&otracker=search&otracker1=search&fm=SEARCH&iid=a98ef2f8-83c3-4acf-a30b-6624b7f56674.ACCFKDVHYGFK96YQ.SEARCH&ppt=sp&ppn=sp&ssid=78zz6ishn40000001569943138256&qH=d7b875ab7fb1d616).
