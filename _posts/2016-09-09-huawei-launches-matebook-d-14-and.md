Huawei has launched a couple of new laptops in China. The MateBook D 14 and MateBook D 15 are Huawei’s latest laptops, and they come packing in the latest 10th-gen processors from Intel, with optional AMD configurations available as well.  

Both the MateBook D 14 and MateBook D 15 feature a similar design, and even share their specifications to some extent. Both the laptops come with a **FullHD display, with 250nits of peak brightness, TUV Rheinland certification, and 178-degree viewing angles**. The only difference in the display is the size — the MateBook D 15 packs in a 15.6-inch FullHD display, while the MateBook D 14 packs a 14-inch FullHD display instead.  

Under the hood, the laptops come with **10th-gen Intel Core processors, configurable up to a 10th-gen Intel Core i7-10510 processor**. The processor here is paired with up to **16GB RAM, and up to an Nvidia MX250 GPU**. If you go with the AMD configuration, Huawei is offering the **Ryzen R5-3550U processor** paired with up to 16GB RAM, and Radeon Vega 8 GPU.  

For storage, the MateBook D 15 will let you go up to a **256GB SSD paired with a 1TB HDD**, while the 14-inch **MateBook D 14 is limited to a 512GB SSD**. What’s intriguing about the configurations here is actually the battery. The MateBook D 14 comes with a 56Wh battery, but the bigger 15-inch MateBook D 15 actually comes with a smaller 42Wh battery pack instead.  

In terms of I/O options, both the laptops come with a **USB-C port, a USB 3.0 Type-A port, a couple of USB 2.0 Type-A ports, an HDMI port, and a 3.5mm** headphone jack here. There’s also a webcam, but that’s hidden under a Function key until it’s actually needed.  

Huawei has launched the MateBook D 15 and MateBook D 14 for a starting price of CNY 3,999 (~Rs.40,000). The laptops are available to pre-order in China and will go on sale starting December 3.
