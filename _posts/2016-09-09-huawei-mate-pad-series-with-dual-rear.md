Image of the MatePad Pro tablet that surfaced recently revealed a punch-hole screen, stylus support and a keyboard accessory. There could be normal and Pro versions of the tablet. It is rumored  to be powered by Kirin 990 SoC with support for up to 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage, as well as a large battery of at least 7000mAh with support for QuickCharge technology. This was earlier rumored to launch as MediaPad M7, successor of the M6, which was announced back in June, so this might feature a similar four-channel Quad Speakers, HUAWEI Histen sound support and Harman Kardon audio certification, and  pogo pins on the for keyboard support. We should know more details in the coming days and the price when it goes official later this month. Source
