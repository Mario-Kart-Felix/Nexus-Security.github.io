Huawei on Monday announced a new flagship tablet that it believes will be able to compete with other premium tablets in the market, such as the iPad Pro and the Galaxy Tab S6. Called the **Huawei MatePad Pro**, the device brings one interesting design element that had hitherto only been seen on smartphones – a punch-hole camera upfront. Other than that, the device looks not-too-dissimilar to the Apple iPad Pro, thanks to the slim bezels and rounded corners.

Huawei MatePad Pro Features and Specifications
----------------------------------------------

  

The Huawei MatePad Pro features a 10.8-inch 16:10 WQXGA (2560 x 1600) 2.5D curved glass display and is powered by the Kirin 990 SoC. It comes with either 6GB or 8GB of LPDDR4x RAM alongside with 128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB of built-in storage. The device carries a 7,250mAh battery with 40W wired charging and 15W wireless charging. It also supports reverse wireless charging up to 7.5W. It runs Android 10 out-of-the-box, but as one would expect, lacks Google’s apps and services thanks to the US government’s ongoing [embargo against Huawei](https://beebom.com/huawei-planning-android-replace-google-apps/).  

Imaging options on the MatePad Pro include a 13MP (f/1.8) auto focus rear camera with PDAF and an 8MP (f/2.0) front-facing camera. The device also sports Harman Kardon-certified Quad speakers with Huawei Histen sound effect. Connectivity options include 4G LTE (Optional), dual-band (2.4/5GHz) Wi-Fi 802.11 ac, Bluetooth 5.1 LE, GPS and USB Type-C. Huawei has also confirmed that a 5G version is in the works for Q1, 2020.  

The MatePad Pro also comes with a Samsung Dex-like feature called ‘Computer Mode’ that brings a desktop interface on the tablet. Another notable feature is the **M-Pencil** for Graffiti painting, document processing, note-taking and more. The device comes with 4096-level pressure sense and 20ms ultra-low latency. The M-Pencil can be wirelessly charged by magnetically attaching it to the top of the tablet. An hour of charge is said to offer up to ten hours of continuous usage.
