Render image of the phone has surfaced showing its design differences from the standard Nova 6 5G. The render shows the primary differences between the SE and the standard version. Notably, the punch hole camera in the front is a single one, compared to the dual punch hole design in the Nova 5G variant. The back of the phone also shows differences in its camera array. There is a square camera bump with a flash below it. The cameras are rumoured to be the upcoming Sony's IMX686 60-megapixel sensor, along with 16 megapixel, 2-megapixel and another 2-megapixel sensors. The phone will likely be powered by its in-house HUAWEI Kirin 810 7nm chipset and could packs a 4800mAh battery with 40-Watt charging support. Source
