Huawei unveiled the Sound X, a [smart speaker](https://beebom.com/best-smart-speakers-india/) built in partnership with French audiophile-grade equipment maker Devialet earlier this week in China. Judging by the looks, it certainly looks somewhat similar to [Apple’s HomePod](https://beebom.com/apple-homepod-vs-amazon-echo-vs-google-home/).  

However, we are not here for the looks. Let’s get to the specifications of the Sound X. Firstly, Sound X is a **360-degree speaker** with a **60-watt double subwoofer**. Thanks to the collaboration with Devialet, Sound X comes with the company’s Speaker Active Matching technology (SAM) that reduces distortion in audio and push-push woofer vibration-canceling technology, as Engadget [reports](https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/25/huawei-devialet-sound-x-speaker/).  

The speaker has a convenient one-touch control and Huawei’s HiLink smart home control. For voice commands, it comes with Huawei’s “Xiaoyi” voice assistant that supports Huawei Music.  

In case you’re wondering, Huawei Sound X is a **Hi-Res certified speaker** capable of producing lossless audio output. It has a diameter of 165mm, a height of 203mm, and weighs 3.5kg. It also supports pairing two Sound X speakers at once for the stereo effect.  

It is worth noting that this is not the first time Huawei is coming up with a smart speaker that resembles popular smart speakers. In fact, the company launched a Google Home lookalike speaker with Alexa and a HomePod resembling speaker last year.  

As far as the pricing is concerned, Sound X will **retail at 1,999 Yuan** which roughly translates to Rs.20,000. For those interested to buy 2 units for that stereo experience, Huawei offers it for 3,888 Yuan. The smart speaker will be sold exclusively in China and the pre-orders have already begun.  

Sound X got announced by Huawei along with [Huawei MatePad Pro](https://beebom.com/huawei-matepad-pro-launched/), the Chinese tech giant’s reply to Apple’s iPad Pro. So, what are your thoughts on Sound X? Tell us in the comments.
