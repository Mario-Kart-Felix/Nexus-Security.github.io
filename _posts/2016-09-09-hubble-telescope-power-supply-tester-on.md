Got $75K spare? Then this is the eBay deal for you! \[jvanorsdal\] pointed us to this eBay bargain: the [VPI Vehicle Power Interface Rack & Console Hubble Space Telescope](https://www.ebay.com/itm/NASA-ARTIFACT-VPI-Vehicle-Power-Interface-Rack-Console-Hubble-Space-Telescope/261090432601). This was the actual system used to test the power systems of the Hubble Space Telescope before it was launched, so it’s a genuine piece of space history.

For the price you get two, yes two CRT displays, six HP power supplies and a huge amount of hand-wired history. Even if you aren’t going to bid, it is worth taking a look at the insides of this thing, as it is all hand-soldered and the cable routing is a thing of beauty. I have absolutely no use for this, but I totally want it for my living room.![](https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/hubble-2.jpg?w=400)

There are a few gotchas, though. Because it is NASA space hardware, you can’t export it to places like Iran, and the shopping cost for the US is a cool $1.5K. Considering the size of the thing, that is not so bad, perhaps: it is built into a three rack metal cabinet with built-in wheels that measures over 7 feet long and weighs over 800 lbs.

Interested? It is on sale for $75k, and there is a handy buy it now button on the site.

We all love space history here at Hackaday. Back in 2019, our own \[Tom Nardi\] got to spend an [evening with the Space Shuttle Atlantis](https://hackaday.com/2019/06/18/an-evening-with-space-shuttle-atlantis/).
