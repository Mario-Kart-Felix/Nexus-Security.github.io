> [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), the San Francisco–based for-profit AI research lab, this week released [a study](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/papers/solving-rubiks-cube.pdf) documenting the development of an AI-linked robotic hand named [Dactyl](https://openai.com/blog/learning-dexterity/). Since May of 2017, the researchers have been trying to train Dactyl to intelligently solve the [Rubik’s Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube).

> For robotic systems built specifically to solve the puzzle, the Rubik’s Cube hasn’t traditionally posed much of a challenge. Some such systems have been shown to solve the puzzle in [under a second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&v=nt00QzKuNVY), well below the previous human record of five seconds. Those robots don’t use humanoid hands, though.
