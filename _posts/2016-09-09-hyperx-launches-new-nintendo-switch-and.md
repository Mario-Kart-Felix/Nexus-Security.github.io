You’re probably familiar with Hyper X’s products for PC gaming, and perhaps consoles as well. At CES 2020, Hyper X also pulled back the curtain on two mobile-oriented products that can take your gaming on the Nintendo Switch or mobile phone to the next level.

We got to try the HyperX ChargePlay Clutch for Nintendo Switch, which is a charging case for Nintendo’s portable system. It acts as both a grip for improved hold on the system, as well as a battery pack to extend the Switch’s lifetime. The built-in battery pack is 6000mAh, which can charge the 4310mAh internal battery almost one and a half times.

If you prefer to play your Switch in handheld mode, you can attach the Joy-Con grips to the system and carry it around in one piece. Or, if you prefer, you can also detach the Joy-Con grips and use the ChargePlay Clutch’s kickstand to hold the Switch up on a table.

Finally, you can clip the Joy-Con holders together and use them as a grip, similar to the one included with the Switch. Due to the nature of the product, it’s not compatible with the Switch in docked mode.

HyperX plans to release the ChargePlay Clutch for the Switch in January 2020 at a cost of $59.99.

Those who prefer to play mobile games on their phone can check out the ChargePlay Clutch for Mobile. This is a similar device that securely clamps your smartphone in to hold it for mobile gaming. The textured grips give you an advantage over your opponents.

Even better, the grip supports Qi wireless charging, meaning you can keep your device topped up while playing. The 3000mAh battery is removable and doubles as a portable charging pack.

Expect to see the mobile ChargePlay Clutch in Q2 of 2020 at a price of $59.99.

HyperX is trusted for providing quality gaming products at prices lower than the competition. If either the Switch or mobile are your preferred gaming platform, you should certainly check these offerings out.
