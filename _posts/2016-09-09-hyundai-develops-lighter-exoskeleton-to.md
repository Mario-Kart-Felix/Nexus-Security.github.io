> Jobs like car mechanics require workers to lift one of both arms while lifting heavy weight, drilling, driving screws etc. These tasks may lead to a number of injuries. The injury risk greatly increases when the worker works with unstable footing, holds materials above shoulder height, twists their arms in an awkward position, frequently flexing the neck, or performs repetitive movements with force.
> 
> To alleviate the burden in this type of work, Hyundai Motor Group has developed a wearable exoskeleton vest called Vest Exoskeleton (VEX). The new vest is up to 42% lighter than similar products in the market, the company said in a [press release](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hyundai-motor-group-develops-wearable-vest-exoskeleton-to-alleviate-burden-in-overhead-work-300910861.html)
