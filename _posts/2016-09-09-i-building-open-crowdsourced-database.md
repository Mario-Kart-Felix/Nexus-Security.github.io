Thanks for visiting! I am building a database of all the models so we (ML engineers) have a central place to find and share models and their variants. I'm not sure where this is leading - maybe a directory site, maybe a repository where you can upload models and edit them - but I figured I could start with this spreadsheet, which would hopefully provide value to you on its own. Please contribute if you have a moment to share your expertise, and feel free to download and/or bookmark this for your future reference.
