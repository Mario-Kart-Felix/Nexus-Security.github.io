Youtube has one of the worst user experiences out there, there are thousands of people complaining about the same and is why [this meme](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FxdG1FDJ.jpg&t=MjU0NWQyN2Q3ZjZjN2MwYmY0OTkxOGZiYzk2Njg3MTU3ZDY2ZTc1YSw5d2VadFB2cQ%3D%3D&b=t%3A8HDYYr_43fD_jdFotLVdxQ&p=https%3A%2F%2Fivanca.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F189138018193%2Fwhy-i-click-the-dislike-button-on-videos-that-i&m=1) went viral with a caption that reads: “Youtube is unwatchable. The ads are incessant, the up next related videos are horrible inaccurate, autoplay is a major pain, and for the last time NO I don’t want to sign up for youtube premium.” 

One part that really stands out is how bad is recommendation engine is, and one of the main reasons is so bad is that is the user cannot chose what their recommendations are based on, so I (and I suspect many others) realized the most simple way to train the algorithm: Click “dislike” on videos that I don’t want any recommendations from even if I don’t really want to lower the rating of such videos, unfortunately this is usually not enough, navigating the web remembering to click “dislike” on every video I don’t want recommendations from is hard, so I’m using this post to beg for someone at Alphabet/YouTube to give us viewers (prosumers?) a quick and easy way to undo what videos recommendations are base on, as shown in this little video I made:
