Bad news for Zedd fans in the Far East.

According to **[Zedd](https://edm.com/tag/zedd)**, one of his online interactions has landed him on the receiving end of a ban from lawmakers in China. After showing the most nominal level of support for the creators of the animated comedy series _South Park_, he says he is no longer allowed in the country.

According to Zedd (real name Anton Zaslavski), his ban resulted from him liking a tweet from the _South Park_ account. The show itself had been scrubbed from the Chinese internet after the airing of an episode aptly titled "Band in China" which criticized Hollywood for bending to the will of overseas censors.

Zaslavski has not specified which tweet he thinks landed him the ban. On Monday, _South Park_Â creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker shared an incendiary response to Chinese lawmakers. In the show's subsequent 300th episode, one of the characters, Randy Marsh, was also given the line "Fuck the Chinese government."

Zaslavski's **ORBIT Tour** will take him to Madison, Wisconsin on Friday, October 11th. The following night he will appear in Minneapolis, Minnesota, followed by a European leg of tour dates.
