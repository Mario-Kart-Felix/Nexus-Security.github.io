> For my project I decided to line the heart in a ‘I love NYC’ t shirt so that the heart lit up. I decided to make the lights fade in and out at a rather fast pace because it reminds me of the entertainment lights in restaurants and bars that cause people’s eyes to focus on them. I decided to make this because I am currently in a Wearable Technology class at the University of Cincinnati and thought it would be a cool and unique way for me to show the skills I have developed so far. It is a battery powered circuit that you turn on and off with the Lilypad ProtoSnap board. When on, the lights fade in and out around the heart bringing focus to that feeling.
