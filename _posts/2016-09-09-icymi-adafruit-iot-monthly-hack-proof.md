How I Made My Heating Smart without Damaging or Replacing Anything
------------------------------------------------------------------

[Andy Bradford](https://twitter.com/andycb/status/1223606976246157313) has been wanting to upgrade their home’s heating system for a some time – but their house is rented. Damaging the house would cause them to lose their security deposit, “so the whole system must do no damage, be made only of removable parts and be installed without modifying any of the existing infrastructure.” – [AndyBradford.dev](https://andybradford.dev/2020/02/01/how-i-made-my-heating-smart-without-damaging-or-replacing-anything/)

The Things Industries announced the launch of a Global Join Server which allows activation of any LoRa network, anywhere in the world, as long as it uses LoRa standard interfaces. This new ecosystem’s role is to “store root keys, generate session keys, and send them securely to the network and application servers”. This new model replaces the need for manufacturers to generate secure keys. – [Things Industries via LinkedIn Pulse](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/things-industries-launches-global-join-server-push-secure-giezeman/)
