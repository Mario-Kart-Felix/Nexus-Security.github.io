IoT News and More!

Particle deprecates Particle Mesh, discontinuing Particle Xenon
---------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/02/particlenote.png)

[Particle](https://www.particle.io/) has announced today that they are discontinuing development of Particle Mesh, their OpenThread-based mesh networking solution, and will no longer be manufacturing their associated Xenon development board.

Particle states they ran into two barriers which kept them from delivering on the promise with Particle Mesh:

*   Mesh networking, while a compelling technology, is extremely complex, and trying to make it “just work” with zero configuration for all customers in all environments just wasn’t feasible. As a result, the experience of Particle Mesh doesn’t live up to the standard that we set for ourselves with our other products.
*   It turns out that, for most of our customers, 802.15.4 mesh networking seems to not have been the right technology in the first place; most customers would be better off using Bluetooth Low Energy (which we will continue to invest in) or a sub-GHz radio like LoRa (which can be added to Particle through third-party accessories).

See Particle’s [full announcement](https://blog.particle.io/2020/01/28/mesh-deprecation/) and learn [How to use Xenon with CircuitPython](https://docs.particle.io/tutorials/learn-more/xenon-circuit-python/).

All the Internet of Things Episode 6: Digi-Key IoT Studio
---------------------------------------------------------

![](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/02/dk_all_the_iot.png)

Adafruit and Digi-Key have teamed up to present All the Internet of Things – a six-episode series covering everything you could ever want to know about the Internet of Things.

We are very excited to release the final episode, which incorporates all the different subjects discussed in previous episodes, and shows off this incredible resource: [Digi-Key IoT Studio](https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/design-tools/dk-iot-studio).

Unlike most other IoT platforms, [Digi-Key IoT Studio is code-less — all sensor interaction and storage is done automatically by the drag-and-drop IDE](https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/design-tools/dk-iot-studio). You don’t need to install toolchains, code editors or compile any code on your computer! Digi-Key Studio runs in your web browser, handles all aspects of developing an internet of things project, and even compiles your code remotely.
