> _“Scott Shawcroft is the project lead for CircuitPython and is sponsored by Adafruit Industries, an open source electronics company. CircuitPython is an implementation of Python that runs independent of any OS and is plug and play. It is based on MicroPython rather than CPython. CircuitPython ships on thousands of electronics every month, introducing new coders to Python on inexpensive electronics.”_

> _“PyCascades is a two-day, single-track Python conference. We previously hosted PyCascades in Vancouver and Seattle. For our third iteration in 2020 we’ll be in Portland, Oregon USA. PyCascades is organized by members of the Python communities in Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland. We aim to bring together Python users and developers from both the Pacific Northwest and around the world.”_

> _…when I heard about MicroPython Kickstarter campaign and read some technical descriptions which were very solid, I got instantly hooked and pledged to its author to open up source soon after the conclusion of the very successful campaign, instead of at the time of shipping the devices – all to allow open-source cooperation. I’ve contributed to MicroPython for around 4 years since, having written some 30% of the codebase. Sadly, going forward, I felt that the ideas of minimalism with which we started are being betrayed, while conflict of interest was growing between a contributor doing a work in his own free time, based on beliefs and ideals, vs a small business which needs to satisfy its customers to stay afloat and generate profit. So, we parted our ways. That’s how Pycopy came to be. Unlike MicroPython, which came to concentrate on “microcontrollers” (a mistake repeated after another small Python implementation, PyMite, which in my opinion came is its downfall), Pycopy wants to be a full-stack language for “everything”._

What’s the team up to this week?
--------------------------------

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

[![Bryan](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/02/0211202bryan.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This week I assembled and tested the Rev B board for the APDS9500 gesture sensor. I then got to work turning my prototype code into something that resembles a CircuitPython driver, followed by writing an Arduino version of the same. This little guy is pretty cool; we’ve got it fairly reliably detecting up, down, left and right hand waves and we’re also getting pretty decent detections of forward and backward motions. There is a lot more this sensor can do, but that will probably be it for now. If it proves wildly popular, we’ll consider adding more.

I also wrote a CircuitPython driver for the DPS310 pressure sensor and helped Kattni with the guide for it. Pressure sensors are pretty cool, and that least right into my next project: I’ve been working on using the [Feather STM32F405 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4382) and [ST LPS33 Pressure sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4414) to make a CircuitPython powered sip and puff input device.

These helpful tools sense the relative pressure applied to a tube by the user and translates that into an input that their computer can understand. This allows folks who aren’t able to use a mouse or keyboard to control their computer by sipping or blowing on the tube. Since we’re doing this one in CircuitPython, we’ll be able to make it super simple to configure things like how much pressure is needed to trigger an input, and what input or input combinations can be triggered by the user.

**Dan**

[![Dan](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/02/02112020dan.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I released CircuitPython 5.0.0-beta.5 on Tuesday evening. The release includes a number of bug fixes and enhancements, and you can now connect to up to five BLE devices instead of just two.

I am working on a CircuitPython BLE bicycle speed and cadence library. I built a jig to simulate a bicycle hub and crank arm (running at the same speed), spun by a motor driven by a Crickit. It was a pleasure to actually use the Crickit library I wrote a long time ago for something other than just testing.

After I finish the bicycle library, I’ll be working on increasing the SPI speed on the nRF52840 so we can drive displays more quickly. The nRF52840 can do SPI up to 32MHz on one of its SPI peripherals, but we have to work around some significant hardware bugs to make use of it.

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/02/02112020jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This week I’m building on work by Zoltán Vörös (v923z on GitHub), Andrew Gatherer (@GathererA) , and Thomas Schucker to bring a library called “ulab” to CircuitPython.

ulab is similar to the numpy package for standard Python, and enables efficient operation on arrays of numbers. ulab is authored primarily by Zoltán Vörös, and Andrew Gatherer did the bulk of converting it so it was ready to be used in CircuitPython. Their open source code really made this project a breeze!

ulab includes routines for FFTs, so I adapted a demo by Thomas Schucker to compute an audio spectrogram and made it run on the new CLUE board from Adafruit.

It’s our hope to enable ulab soon for all nRF boards and almost all “m4” boards supported by CircuitPython! It slightly missed the deadline for beta 5 because we’re working on the documentation.

**Kattni**

This week I created a library for the new [Adafruit CLUE](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4500). [Adafruit CircuitPython CLUE](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_CLUE) makes it super simple to use all the features of the board, without the need for all the setup. It provides easy access to all the sensors, buttons, LEDs and touch inputs. As well, it provides an quick way to display lines of text on the display, with customisable colors. This allows you to quickly create a list of sensor data, or any text you’d like. There is a simpletest example that prints sensor data to the serial console, so you can verify that all your sensors are working as expected, as well as an example of how to use the text display feature of the library to show sensor and input data on the display. For more information and examples of each feature, check out the [documentation on Read the Docs](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/projects/clue/en/latest/).

[![Kattni](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/02/02112020kattni.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

The library is available in the [CircuitPython library bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). Testers have already found a couple of issues with it and I’ve fixed them, so check for updates over the next few weeks as more people start testing it and, as is the way of things, find new bugs. You can always download the latest release from GitHub, but it’s best to keep everything up to date with the latest [bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). Next up I’m working on creating a series of examples for CLUE using all of the amazing built in sensors, starting with a height calculator. Keep an eye out for a bunch of fun things you can do with your new Adafruit CLUE!

**Lucian**

This week, I added UF2 support to the STM32 make options. I also started on the STM32F407 Discovery board definition, which unfortunately has gotten caught up in some USB weeds. I also wrapped up the last STM32 issue for 5.0 by adding core temperature, voltage and us delay support.

This week, I’m hoping to wrap up my support for the Espruino boards, and also regroup a little and analyze the priorities for the STM32 port overall. I’ll also be modifying the UF2 bootloader to better match the behavior of other ports, and making it available to other boards with good external flash support.

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/02/02112020melissa.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This past week, I have been heads down mostly working on the WebSerial plotter. I have added features such as a dark mode theme and an XY plot mode for mapping acceleration data. After adding those, I have been combing through the code making improvements for switching seamlessly and other improvements in general.

**Scott**

This week I dove into using Adafruit IO with CircuitPython. Brent, Adam, Ladyada, and Justin have done an awesome job getting CircuitPython connected. I’m working to create a simple, but not secure, sensor network using Bluetooth Low Energy advertisements that we’re calling BroadcastNet.

In BroadcastNet, one or more bridge devices will listen for broadcasts and use WiFi or Ethernet to log data to an IoT service. I’m using an ItsyBitsy M4 Express with a Airlift Bitsy Wing now. The sensor nodes can be any nRF52840 based board and use any sensors that are connected to it. The broadcast packet format is standardized so that the bridges can listen for multiple sensors and automatically create new feeds for new data.

BroadcastNet will make it very easy to customize your own sensors for whatever purpose you have.

The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit’s highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it’s time to water a plant.
