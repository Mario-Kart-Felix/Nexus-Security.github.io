Currently, the game only works in beta. [Load it directly into your editor in beta](https://arcade.makecode.com/beta#pub:https://github.com/tballmsft/pxt-bouldergame).

The goal of the game: collect all the diamonds. Don’t let a rock fall on you or the skull get you! Kill the skull by pushing a rock so that it falls onto the skull. More features/levels are to come shortly. Comments and suggestions welcome. – [MakeCode Forum](https://forum.makecode.com/t/arcade-tileworld-extension-and-demo-boulder-game/659)

What is Microsoft MakeCode?
---------------------------

Microsoft MakeCode is a free, open source platform for creating engaging computer science learning experiences that support a progression path into real-world programming.

**Simulator**

[![Simulator](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2019/11/81419sim.jpg)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode/about)

An interactive simulator provides students with immediate feedback on how their program is running and makes it easy to test and debug their code.

**Block Editor**

[![Block Editor](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2019/11/81419block.jpg)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode/about)

Students new to coding can start with colored blocks that they can drag and drop onto their workspace to construct their programs.

**JavaScript Editor**

[![JavaScript Editor](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2019/11/81419jsed.jpg)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode/about)
