> More than 100 trees will adorn the gridded facade of IKEA’s city-centre Vienna Westbahnhof store, which will have no car parking spaces.
> 
> Currently under construction in the Austrian capital, the car-free IKEA store is designed by local studio Querkraft Architekten to address “radically changed customer and mobility behaviours”.
> 
> IKEA Vienna Westbahnhof, which will have a grid-like form enveloped by greenery, will provide on-the-day delivery services and be easily accessible by foot or public transport.
