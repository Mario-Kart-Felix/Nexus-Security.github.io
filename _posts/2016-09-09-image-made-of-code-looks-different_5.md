> PureCSS Lace is the latest of digital artist Diana Smith’s code portraits inspired by Flemish baroque oil paintings, joining [PureCSS Francine](https://github.com/cyanharlow/purecss-vignes) from May 2018. Along with a few [retro-inspired posters](https://github.com/cyanharlow/purecss-zigario) and a [woman in neon-glowing profile](https://github.com/cyanharlow/purecss-pink), the pieces are created from code, instead of embedded .jpg image files that look the same no matter how you view them.
