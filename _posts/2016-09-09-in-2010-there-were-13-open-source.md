In May of 2010, almost 10 years ago, Ladyada and I gave a presentation called “Million dollar baby – Businesses designing and selling open source hardware, making millions” ([video](https://youtu.be/hTqWOAjrvvk)).

Intro text from the event:

> _“At O’Reilly’s foo camp east 2010 at Microsoft’s NERD center (MIT campus) we presented “Million dollar baby – Businesses designing and selling open source hardware, making millions” at the Ignite hour. 20 slides, 15 seconds per slide – we tried to capture the excitement and great work from just a few of the dozens of open source hardware companies & resellers. Special thanks to all the companies who helped with some data points and to the OSHW workshop group.”_

**At the time (2010), the companies that were approaching $1m in annual revenue were:**

*   Bug Labs
*   Dangerous Prototypes
*   DIY Drones

![Ohm](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2019/09/ohm.jpg)

October is [open-source hardware month](https://ohm.oshwa.org/)! Every single day in October we’ll be posting up some open-source stories from the last decade (and more!) about open-source hardware, open-source software, and beyond!

Have an open-source hardware (or software) success story? A person, company, or project to celebrate? An open-source challenge? Post up here in the comments or email [opensource@adafruit.com](mailto:opensource@adafruit.com), we’ll be looking for, and using the tag [#OHM2019](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OHM2019&src=typed_query&f=live) online as well! Check out [all the events](https://ohm.oshwa.org/events/) going on here!
