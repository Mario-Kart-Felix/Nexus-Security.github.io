On India-US trade ties: “Both I and USTR Robert Lighthizer have understood that we have huge potential... We will hopefully come out with a first set of agreements soon... But we both believe India & US must look at much larger engagement.” On RCEP: “Every interest of domestic industry and people of India has to be protected before we execute any FTA. We won't fritter away FTAs like we saw in 2009-10 period of the Congress regime.”— PIYUSH GOYAL, Commerce & Industry Minister
