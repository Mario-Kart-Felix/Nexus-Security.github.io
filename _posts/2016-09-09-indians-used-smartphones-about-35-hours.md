It is no surprise that people use smartphones extensively here in India. Have you ever wondered how long that it could possibly be? Well, App Annie’s “State of Mobile: 2020” report sheds light on exactly that with some shocking statistics.  

According to App Annie, Indians spent **about 3 hours and 30 minutes per day on smartphones**. That’s a 25% increase when compared to 2017. _“Mobile-first emerging markets like Indonesia, Brazil, and India continue to spend the most time in mobile each day.”,_ [states](https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/state-of-mobile-2020-infographic/) the report.  

**India’s average smartphone usage time is still lower than the global average** of 3 hours and 40 minutes. Also, people in other emerging markets including Indonesia, China, Brazil, and South Korea spend more than 4 hours using smartphones on a daily basis.  

On the other hand, the values are much lower with less than 3 hours daily usage in markets like Japan, Canada, the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Take a look at the comparison chart below.
