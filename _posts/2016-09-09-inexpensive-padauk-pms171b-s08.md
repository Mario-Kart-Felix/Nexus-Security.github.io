The [electronupdate blog](http://electronupdate.blogspot.com/2019/10/padauk-pms171b-s08.html) has done their 6th Paduak decap, the PMS171B-S08.

With only 8 pins there are 6 IO. However it’s clear there are many more bond pads on this die.  We now see a die which is designed to be packaged in a variety of body styles: some with more pins, some less.

The die size is just a bit larger than the super-inexpensive PFS150.  0.403 mm2 vs 0.276 mm2.

For that die area one gets an 8 bit ADC,1 band gap (good for precision voltages) and 1x more 8 bit timer.

Below is the die annotated (the reason they are de-capping so many parts is to try to tease out what each block looks like.  As features are added or removed it should have a visible effect on the design.)

See the [blog post](http://electronupdate.blogspot.com/2019/10/padauk-pms171b-s08.html) for additional details and close-ups.
