\[Amirreza Nasiri\] sends in this cool [USB keystroke injector.](https://github.com/AmirrezaNasiri/usb-keystroke-injector)

The device consists of an Arduino, a Bluetooth module, and an SD card. When it’s plugged into the target computer the device loads the selected payload from the SD card, compromising the system. Then it does its unique trick which is to switch the injector over to Bluetooth mode. Now the attacker has much more control, albeit local, over the system.

While we would never even be tempted to plug this device into a real computer, we like some of the additional features, like how an added dip switch can be used to select from up to eight different payloads depending on the required attack. The addition of a [photo diode](https://hackaday.com/2019/02/22/radiation-detector-eschews-tubes-uses-photodiode/) is also interesting, and makes us dream of all sorts of impractical movie hacker scenarios. \[Amirreza\] says it’s to trigger when the person leaves the room and turns the lights off.

\[Amirreza\] has all the code and design files on the GitHub. There are also a few payload examples, which should be fun to hack on. After all, one of life’s pleasures is to find new ways to [mess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) with your friends.
