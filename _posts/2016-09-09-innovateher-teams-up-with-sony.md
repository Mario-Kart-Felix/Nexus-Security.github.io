InnovateHer is doing great work with their motto: “We’re getting girls ready for the tech industry, and the industry ready for girls.” With the help of Playstation the program is expanding across the UK.

Via [InnovateHer](https://www.innovateher.co.uk/sony/):

> [InnovateHer](https://www.innovateher.co.uk/) is teaming up with Sony’s PlayStation brand to expand its eight week tech programme for teenage girls to more locations across the country. The Digital Bootcamp programme aims to give girls aged between 12-16 key tech and interpersonal skills whilst encouraging them to consider STEM subjects and careers in tech.
> 
> Currently, girls make up only 20% of computer science entries at GCSE, and just 10% at A-level, with [nine times more boys than girls](https://www.wisecampaign.org.uk/news/a-level-results-bust-myths-about-girls-and-science/) gaining an A level in Computer Science this year. InnovateHer, whose mission is “to get girls ready for the tech industry, and the industry ready for girls”, [recently pledged](https://businessmanchester.co.uk/2019/03/01/combined-authorities-back-innovateher/) to tackle these figures by committing to work with schools to reach over 1,000 girls by 2020.
