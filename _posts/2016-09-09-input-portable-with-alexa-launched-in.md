One can also use voice commands to change the volume, control compatible smart home devices, answer questions, read the news, check the weather and more.  

The Echo Input Portable is compatible with a whole bunch of smart home devices from Philips, Wipro, Syska, TP-Link and more. It also comes with multiple layers of privacy protections and controls, including a microphone off button that electronically disconnects the microphones. Alongside all of the above, it is also compatible with most of the [Alexa skills](https://beebom.com/amazon-alexa-can-now-remind-you-to-take-your-medication-on-time/), like booking a cab, ordering food, playing games and more.
