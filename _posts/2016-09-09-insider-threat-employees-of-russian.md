In Russia, there are 73 services that recruit insiders in Russian banks. This information was shared by Darknet researcher Anton Staver.  
  
"Many groups providing such services is due to the amount of work that falls on them," explained Staver. According to the researcher, services that recruit Bank employees receive up to 50 orders a day, which is enough for the existence of an entire industry.  
  
The expert said that customers of such data are usually competitors of banks, jealous spouses of customers, as well as hackers and scammers. Scammers often asked to choose a list of victims with the big account balance. At the same time, according to Staver, recruitment is most often “carried out by specialized structures”.  
  
The expert noted that recruiters receive from customers about 15 thousand rubles ($240) for one employee of the Bank. During the work, the recruiter receives the search criteria, after which the client receives the contacts of the necessary person in Telegram or Jabber. It takes about 5-7 days to search for an insider.  
  
Pavel Krylov, who runs a company specializing in the investigation of cybercrime, agrees with the research data. "Fraudulent schemes using personal data are now successful and effective, so attackers are actively looking for insiders in banks," said the expert. He also noted that various criminal groups taking advantage of theft and withdrawal options use schemes with recruitment for monetization.  
  
The cost of recruitment ranges from 7 thousand to 100 thousand rubles ($112-$1600) and depends on the complexity of the task. If the security service of the Bank works effectively, the price will be much higher. Employees are usually hired through social networks, instant messengers, personal contacts, LinkedIn.
