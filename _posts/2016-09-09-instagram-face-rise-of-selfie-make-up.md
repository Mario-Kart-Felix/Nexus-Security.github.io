IRL, in the middle of the afternoon, on a busy street in London, I actually feel I look like an older woman (I’m 29) trying to be younger. The layers of foundation, contour, blush and highlight all sit thickly on my skin (3D thick, apparently). The eye shadow looks big and vampy. And none of it fits with my clothes, which look far too casual alongside The Face. I walk to meet my friend with my head down, not daring to make eye contact with anyone and feeling more ridiculous with each step. To cheer myself up I take a few more selfies and am instantly filled with a warm sense of satisfaction. Those pictures, so far removed from how I actually, really look, are like hot chocolate for the soul.
