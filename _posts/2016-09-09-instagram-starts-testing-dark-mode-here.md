Dark mode everything seems to be the motto going around right now. Google has now updated most of its apps to support the dark theme, which fits well with the addition of [system-wide dark mode](https://beebom.com/android-10-rolling-out-pixels/) in Android 10. Even [iOS 13](https://beebom.com/apple-releases-ios-13-1-ipados-13-1-tvos-13/) brings a dark mode in tow. So, the latest app to board the dark mode hype train is Instagram.  

Yeah, Instagram is **currently testing an AMOLED dark mode** on Android and it looks absolutely stunning. I was utterly confused when the updated theme applied to my own Instagram app on the Samsung S10e, so much so that I started frantically searching for the force dark mode option. But any other app on my device didn’t have the dark mode applied to it, hence I concluded that it comes from Instagram.

While several reports suggest that Instagram’s dark theme is live on Samsung phones, well, it’s not restricted by OEM and has been rolled out to beta users running the latest build #114.0.0.0.24 on Android. You could be running Android 9 Pie (like my Samsung S10e) or Android 10 (like our Pixel, screenshot above) on the device.  

Instagram’s new dark mode is **activated when you toggle the dark theme on your device**. We haven’t found any new option in the settings to turn on/off the feature and well, Instagram is yet to officially talk about the feature, so all we’re stuck with is mere speculation. There’s a bug in this beta build, which hides the status bar icons while you have the dark theme applied.  

If you are eager to try out the dark mode in Instagram, all you need is a device with an option to toggle the device’s theme (like the ones running Android 10, MIUI 10, OneUI), and the latest Instagram beta APK, which you can grab using the link [right here](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/instagram/instagram-instagram/instagram-instagram-114-0-0-0-24-release/). So, go ahead and give your eyes some rest while you scroll. Don’t forget to show some love to [Beebom’s Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/beebomco) while you’re there.
