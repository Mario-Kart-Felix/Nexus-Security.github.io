From Generative Engine Rumway ML experiments.

We recently wrote about RunwayML as a machine learning platform for creators. Recently, RunwayML started collecting some impressive [projects](https://runwayml.com/madewith) built with their tool. The posts for these ‘experiments’ vary from blog style write-ups with videos (like the trippy [paint your face away](https://shinjitoya.com/paint-your-face-away/) video) to full interactive applications that you can test out in the browser.

The image above shows an example from one of the interactive ‘experiments’ called ‘[Generative Engine](https://experiments.runwayml.com/generative_engine/)‘. Generative engine is billed as a ‘storytelling machine that automatically generates images as you write’. This multi-sensory experience is reminiscent of live painting at concerts with it’s mix of modalities (and it’s pretty fun). The Generative Engine utilized the AttnGAN model which does ‘Fine-Grained Text to Image Generation with Attentional Generative Adversarial Networks’. If you’d like to learn more more about the AttnGAN model checkout the [paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Xu_AttnGAN_Fine-Grained_Text_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf) or try implementing it on RunwayML or with the [code](https://github.com/taoxugit/AttnGAN/) on Github.

As a bonus, here are a few more interactive RunwayML experiments:
