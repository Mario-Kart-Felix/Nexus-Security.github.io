With the price and availability of components these days, it’s easier than ever to throw a whole pile of LEDs at a build and get them flashing away. The hard part is doing it well. \[Amy Goodchild\] is an artist, and has a knack for producing rather beautiful LED projects. [The _When in Dome_ installation is no exception.](https://www.instructables.com/id/Interactive-LED-Dome-With-Fadecandy-Processing-and/)

The build is based around a large geodesic dome, fitted with LED panels that glow and react to the occupants inside. Using the Microsoft Kinect as a sensor enables the dome to map out what’s happening in 3D space, and use this data to guide its animations. WS2812B LED strips were used, in combination with a Fadecandy controller along with Processing. This is a powerful combination which makes designing attractive LED effects easier, without forcing users to go to the effort of writing their own libraries or optimizing their microcontroller code.

For those more interested in the dome itself, you’ll be happy to know that \[Amy\] doesn’t skimp on the details there either. The build actually started as a commercially available kit, though there’s still plenty of manual cutting, screwing, and painting required. She does an excellent job documenting the dome build through a series of videos, and walks the reader through some of the design decisions she made (and would remake, if given the chance).

People love geodesic domes at the best of times; adding an interactive LED installation just takes things to the next level. [We’ve seen them used as greenhouses too](https://hackaday.com/2019/07/01/building-a-geodesic-dome-greenhouse/), and they make [a great hackerspace project as well.](https://hackaday.com/2016/03/07/geodesic-dome-build-at-rev-space-den-haag/) Video after the break.
