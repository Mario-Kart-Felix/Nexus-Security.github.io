> The real magic for this interactive table comes from [Roll20](https://roll20.net/) – it’s a free online service that is normally used to let people remotely connect to each other for a TTRPG game. As well as being able to talk to your group and GM, you can roll dice within the app and control tokens of your characters.
> 
> It also allows a GM to display a map that has a ‘fog of war’ – areas that the players cannot see. From their computer, they can reveal the map as the players explore. Sign up for an account – if you’re the GM, you might want a secondary account to act as the ‘player’ account for the screen.
