[A.T. Makers](https://twitter.com/at_makers) has a brilliant new interface box which allows using an XBox and the XBox Adaptive Controller with a standard PowerChair assistive technology joystick!

A small adapter box contains an [Adafruit Feather M4 microcontroller](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3857). The box converts the joystick signals to USB HID commands via a [CircuitPython](https://www.circuitPython.org/) program. The interface is in a 3D printed enclosure.
