[Spot the Station](https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/home.cfm) is a fun resource you can use to track the International Space station. You can see where it is now and sign up for alerts when its overhead!

Via [NASA](https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/home.cfm):

> Watch the International Space Station pass overhead from several thousand worldwide locations. It is the third brightest object in the sky and easy to spot if you know when to look up.
> 
> Visible to the naked eye, it looks like a fast-moving plane only much higher and traveling thousands of miles an hour faster!
