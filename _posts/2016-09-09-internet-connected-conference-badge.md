[Codensolder](https://codensolder.com/blog/cloudbadge) built a CloudBadge conference badge with the PyBadge, an internet-connected conference badge which communicates with Adafruit IO over MQTT.

While the PyBadge doesn’t have built-in WiFi, codensolder attached an [AirLift WiFi FeatherWing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4264) to the PyBadge’s Feather headers to add WiFi to the CircuitPython code:

The source code for this project is [well-documented on GitHub](https://github.com/iayanpahwa/CloudBadge). More information about [the full build, including the Adafruit IO integration, is available on codensolder’s website](https://codensolder.com/blog/cloudbadge).
