[Maker.io published a guide (and a video) for building an internet-enabled candy dispenser](https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/blogs/2019/iot-sweet-dispenser). The dispenser uses a [Particle Photon](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2723) and [servos](https://www.adafruit.com/product/155) to speed up the build, the real complexity of the project _“comes from the mechanical construction of the dispenser and the software that lies on the Photon”_.
