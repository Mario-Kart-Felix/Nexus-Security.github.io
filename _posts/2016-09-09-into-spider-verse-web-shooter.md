> My take on the web shooters from “Into the Spider-Verse,” version 1.0.
> 
> The design is hinged, making it easily wearable. I am still working on a good way to connect the other side, ideally with velcro. I placed small strips on my prototype print, but it was not strong enough to keep it shut around my wrist.
> 
> I am still working on the design to make it more screen-accurate as well as more functional.
> 
> This design is designed for a slightly smaller than average sized wrist, so rescale accordingly.
> 
> Enjoy and share any ideas you have for improvements.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
