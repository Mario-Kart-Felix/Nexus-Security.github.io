When I was a kid, my mom gave me a book that was titled something like “I Bet You Can!” It had science experiments and tricks and fun little projects. One of them offered a technique to cut a hole in a 3 x 5 card big enough to pass your whole body through. For some reason, that stuck, and I won a few little kid bets with the method.

Pippa Dyrlaga does one better. She makes intricate, astonishingly details works of art with single sheets of paper.

From [Pippa Dyrlaga](https://www.pippadyrlaga.com)‘s website:

> The simplicity of a blank sheet of paper appeals to me. Paper is used in so many aspects of our lives and used to communicate with each other, and I want to do this through my work. There is nothing as ordinary as a blank sheet of paper, but it has so many possibilities and can be turned into something beautiful or meaningful, without adding anything to it.
> 
> I first started paper cutting in 2010. My paper cut works are hand cut from a single sheet of paper. They are first drawn out by hand on the reverse of the paper, and then cut using a scalpel. They can take hours to complete, and I find the process is as important to me as the finished pieces.
