Apart from the new features, iOS 13.2 assets have also revealed the existence of new smart battery cases for iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro and this indicates that Apple might unveil them officially soon. According to a report by MacRumors, a total of 3 different model numbers exist for the new battery cases and each case has a different look. This suggests that Apple is working separate Smart Battery Cases for the newly launched iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max. Regarding the design of the new Smart Battery Cases, they are almost identical to iPhone XS/XS Max/XR Smart Battery Case that was introduced earlier this year, except for the change in the square-shaped camera cutout. There is no information on the price and availability of the new cases yet and we can expect Apple to launch them officially by end of 2019. Source
