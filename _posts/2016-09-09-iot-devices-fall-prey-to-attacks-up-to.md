With more than 40 lakh attacks on IoT (Internet of Things) devices, India is among one of the Top 10 Victims Countries lists in the world. This can be a disappointment for Tech Freaks and companies that have just begun using IoT devices but don't consider protecting their IoT devices such as smart cameras. Hackers didn't even flinch while penetrating the systems. That's how simple the breakthrough was.

Simple methods like password guessing are used for getting the entry in IoT devices. Some sufferers of these attacks set passwords as naive as 'Admin.' And now, India has made it to the index of the top 10 countries that fell prey to IoT attacks in 2019. As shocking as the disturbance was, all of these hacks have happened in just the first half of the year. Nevertheless, it's ironical that India wasn't on this list at the same time last year. That is how distressing the circumstance has become.  
  
In a study titled, 'IoT: A Malware Story,' Kaspersky, a cybersecurity company, says "There is an immense explosion in smart technologies like routers and smart cameras but people hardly care to guard them against cyber invasions, cyber safety solutions." This is due to a massive number of attacks happening in the first half of the year 2019. “Kasperky's honey pots (used as baits by the company to lure hackers) caught 10.5 crore invasions on IoT gadgets from 276,000 different IPs in contrast to 12 million invasions arising from 69,000 IPs in the very time previous year,” said its report.  
  
The increase of IoT gadgets and lack of knowledge on cyber safety make this a sweet harvest for hackers. Invasions on IoT gadgets traversed 10-crore line in the first half of 2019, 9 times the number of attacks happened in the year 2018 at the same time. The Honey pots used as baits to catch the hackers have obtained fascinating knowledge about the manner of working of the hackers. Fortunately, the invasions on IoT gadgets are not complicated. However, lack of knowledge leads to attacks on IoT gadgets. Clicking on vulnerable links in IoT systems, hackers have sharpened their drives to ship into IoT devices and make a profit.
