> This project uses a Raspberry Pi 3 computer to monitor the volume of sound in your home (via the Cloud) to see if and when your pet is upset.
> 
> The best part: if your pet gets too anxious and starts barking or making other loud noises, soothe their sad lil’ soul by turning on music or your own (pre-recorded) voice!
> 
> Along with the Pi (and speakers), we’ll use the SparkFun MEMS microphone breakout board to measure volume levels and trigger the audio player. Data is uploaded to the CloudMQTT service using the MQTT communication protocol.
