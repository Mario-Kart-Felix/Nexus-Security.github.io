TeCoEd on Twitter is rolling their own weather station using the new[ Enviro+ pHAT](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/enviro?variant=31155658457171) from our friends at Pimoroni and a Raspberry Pi in a (nicely painted) enclosure. The Enviro+ can monitor air quality, temperature, pressure, humidity, light and noise levels.

They also [built a beautiful dashboard with Adafruit IO](https://io.adafruit.com/) to monitor their weather station remotely. The dashboard includes gauges for temperature, ambient light levels, pressure, humidity, and the chance of rain. [You can view the dashboard here, though it seems it is a test run and not currently publishing](https://io.adafruit.com/TeCoEd/dashboards/da-weather).
