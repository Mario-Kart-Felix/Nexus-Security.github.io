> On my iPad there is this cover:([https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B06XZH8SKF/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_search\_asin\_title?ie=UTF8&th=1](https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B06XZH8SKF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1)).  
> Other covers are also fine, the important thing is that they do not measure more than 175mm in width and 11mm in depth. if the cover protects only the back side without the front part, the iPad can also be placed with the Home button at the bottom, in this case there are holes to make the audio come out with a slight increase in volume and low tones.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
