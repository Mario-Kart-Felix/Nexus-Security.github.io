Users who are still using iPhone 5 are advised to update their device software by the end of this weekend. If not, users can lose their internet access. The users are being pushed to update their former iOS gadgets. Many of them have got the popups on iPhone 5. However, software update notifications on iPad 4 have not appeared yet. The issue with this is that those devices are jailbroken. The main problem is that these devices are now outdated.

"People who are unable to install iOS 10.3.4 updates by 3 November can be deprived of features that depend on the right time and date," says Apple. This covers Apple's iStore, email, online surfing, and iCloud. While iOS 10.3.4 may not be the newest variant of the iOS system, it is the most up-to-date available for the model. Users of former iPhones are also notified to revive their system software if they want to have precise GPS tracking services.  
  
**How can iPhone 5 users update their devices?**  
The users have been getting pop-up notes recently, prompting them to replace it with the newest iOS update. The software updates can be installed either wirelessly or by using a computer before November 3. Following November 3, the users would have to attach their iPhone 5 to a Mac or computer as the wireless updates option will no longer function. The company also says that "the users of the iPhone 5 should check if their devices are running on software version 10.3.4."  
  
**Other Apple models that are concerned-Â **  
"Users of the iPhone 4S and some earlier variants of the iPad should update to the newest software for the proper working of the GPS location services." says the technology giant. Users of first-generation iPad mini, 4th generation iPad, and other earlier models are also covered in the list. Fortunately, users of the newer models are not concerned with this. Devices that run on wifi only are also safe. "iPhone 5 was a huge success story when it was first launched in 2012. Around 2 million devices were pre-ordered inside the 24 hrs of the launch. It was also the first phone to have a lightning charger. To date, around 70 million phones have been sold," says Apple.
