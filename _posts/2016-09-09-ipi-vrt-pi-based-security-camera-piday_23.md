> This is the IPi VRT. (Vertical) The design presented isn’t an iteration of the previous models; it is it’s own design.This model is made for the technical minded consumer, while having the style and simplicity for the interior decorator inside us all.
> 
> There are no hard edges, with the camera body and ceiling mount blending together to give the appearance of a singular structure. With today’s smart home technology being built with more sleek lines, and more organic in shape, this security camera fits in quite well.
> 
> On the mechanical design, this camera is designed to mostly snap fit together, requiring only two M2x8mm screws for mounting the camera module. The ceiling mount is also a rotational bearing; both pieces being printed as one part, unable to be separated. This makes the mount durable, while allowing reliable 360° rotation.
