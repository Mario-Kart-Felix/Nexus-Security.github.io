Con-KAT-ulations to all those nominated and this years winners! We look forward to reading and reviewing more IP books in 2020!

  

Please note: Some nominations do not appear in the list above, this is because some nominations were excluded for example for not being a book about IP Law, or not being published in 2019. Votes for books that were nominated in the wrong category (e.g. a trade mark book nominated in the copyright category) were counted towards the book in the relevant category.
