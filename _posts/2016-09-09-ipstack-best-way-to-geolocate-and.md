The internet has turned the world into a global marketplace. Now, not only you can sell your products in your local region, but anywhere in the world. It’s especially true for software products that can be delivered to customers with just a push of the button. While this is great, it also opens a lot of challenges. One of the biggest challenges that come with serving a global market is the inability to identify your customers. If you do not know your customer’s origin, you cannot effectively target them with proper prices and advertisements. For example, the purchasing power capabilities of customers vary widely depending on their country of origin and you might want to offer lower prices to potential customers from lower-income countries. That’s where a tool like [ipstack](https://ipstack.com/) can help you.  

ipstack offers a geolocation API and its global IP database services that can help you identify and locate your website visitors based on their IP address. Since IP addresses are unique to each machine, you can bet that you are getting correct data. It can even identify if a visitor is trying to spoof their IP address, so there is no chance of getting corrupted data here. In this article, we are going to take a quick look at ipstack and find out what it has to offer us.  

ipstack IP to Geolocation APIs: What Are the Advantages?
--------------------------------------------------------

  

As I mentioned above, the IP to geolocation APIs offered by ipstack can help you identify the location of your visitors. You can use this information to offer location-based prices, discounts, target ads based on location, and much more. You can even customize the whole user experience based on the user location if you wish. The best thing about ipstack and the thing that matters the most is that its data is accurate. Its **API covers over 2 million unique locations in more than 200.000 cities around the world**. It has partnered with most major ISPs around the world to get you the most accurate results.

But, don’t worry if you are not running an enterprise-level company. In fact, the second biggest advantage of ipstack is that it can serve you irrespective of your size. Whether you are an individual business owner, an enterprise, or anything in between, ipstack has a plan to satisfy your needs.  

ipstack API: The Different Modules

The ipstack API consists of multiple modules, all of which serve a specific purpose. Together, they give you a complete picture of your customer so you can deliver a tailored shopping experience. Here are the modules that ipstack brings.

This is the main module of ipstack API. **It identifies a visitor’s location thereby giving you access to a set of localization data** (country’s flag, language, capital, etc.) to implement geographic restrictions on your site, optimize ad targeting, or deliver user experiences based on the location of your website visitors.  

![currency module](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/currency-module.jpg)

  
  

  

The currency module gets you an instant and accurate information about the **primary currency used in the location along with the currency symbol, currency code,** and more. This is quite helpful if you are running an e-commerce website. For example, you can show a currency converter in the checkout page to show how much a product will cost in the customer’s currency.  

![timezone module](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/timezone-module.jpg)

As the name suggests, the time zone module helps you find out about the time zone your users are located. It consists of information such as such as **GMT offset, current user time, time code, and time zone location.**  

![connection module](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/connection-module.jpg)

The connection module can help you **log the unique autonomous system number** (ASN) of visitors’ ISPs along with their names. You can use this for analytics or setting up filters.  

![security module](https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/security-module.jpg)

Security Module helps you protect your data. First of all, it **identifies any proxy connections** which is helpful to filter out junk data. It also identifies IP addresses of crawlers along with the crawler type, **threat type, and the threat level.** You can use this data to either tighten your security or just outright filter them so they are not able to visit your website.
