A source known as iPTF14hls, assumed to be a Type IIP supernova, may be a long-term outﬂow similar to stellar winds, according to a new study published November 5 on arXiv.org. The new research proposes that iPTF14hls is most likely a so-called "hyper-wind"—an extreme mass outflow from a massive star.
