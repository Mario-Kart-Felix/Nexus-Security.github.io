**a**pple analysts claimed today that the new iPhone to be released in 2020 will pack an in display Touch ID sensor, possibly alongside Face ID but also as the only biometric option.  

  

Coincidentally, Qualcomm announced a new, larger ultrasonic sensor designed to be embedded behind a phone's display. It is reported to have a reader area seventeen times as large as those currently in use.

  

Aside from the hype and the larger display area they enable, I'm not a fan of this solution. I think Apple got Face ID right first time and the adoption of a sensor technology with known security weaknesses would be a retrograde step.

  

If Apple decides it wants a fingerprint sensor I'd prefer to see one embedded in the power button or in the back of a new iPhone design instead.
