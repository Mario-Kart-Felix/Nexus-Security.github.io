According to the fresh news that has been coming from various experts, it has appeared that Chandrayaan-2 (also known as Mission Moon), a famous mission by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) was attacked by hackers from North Korea. It also appears that the attacks were organized using a malware named Dtrack, which is connected to a club of North Korean hackers managed by the administration. "The malware was identified by the Financial Institute and Research Centers in 18 Indian states," confirms the reports by Kaspersky, a cybersecurity firm.

It is also said that the same malware was used to direct hacks on Kudankulam nuclear factory. The National Cyber Coordination Center that attempts to protect the nation from harmful cyber invasions recently received critical information from a US cybersecurity firm regarding the hack. It said that Kunankulam Nuclear Plant's master domain controllers alongside the ISRO were attacked by the hackers. Following this incident, Kaspersky's specialists detected the malware and notified the issue to the Indian government before the Chandrayaan-2 landing.  
  
"The hack was organized using very simple and basic techniques like phishing emails, an unedited browser, and poor security that resulted in allowing the hackers to easily invade the devices," says Yash Kadakia in an interview, founder, Security Brigade, a cybersecurity firm in Mumbai. He further adds that a similar server was used to send spams to superior nuclear experts at the Nuclear Plant in Kudankulam which was also aimed by the hackers to pick other experts at ISRO later.  
**About Dtrack Malware-Â **  
Generated by North Korean Hackers, the Dtrack malware provides a full command that permits the hackers to obtain data from the device. The virus can misuse devices with weak privacy and passwords. If the virus invades a device, it can obtain critical information like catalogs, IDs, user history, and IP addresses. "A high number of DTrack attacks were discovered. The hack was carried by Lazarus that has become a major concern for big corporations," said Konstantin Zykov about the virus who is a Researcher at Kaspersky Cybersecurity, at an event in Delhi.
