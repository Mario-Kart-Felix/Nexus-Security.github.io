[Issue 26 of HackSpace Magazine](https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/26) features the Adafruit Drawdio Kit as a Best of the Best in their Best of Breed on educational soldering kits.

> Another, more complicated, kit that makes the list is the [Drawdio](https://www.adafruit.com/product/124). It’s not going to be the kit we would use for teaching hundreds of people in a workshop, but again, with just a few students, or even one, this makes a great choice. It’s fun, easy to put together, and the end result is entertaining. We have even hacked a few kits to make other interesting musical  
> instruments. You can see a video of ‘Drawdio meets Unruly’ on the [Drawdio kit website](https://drawdio.com/).

> But what is Drawdio? Drawdio is an electronic pencil that lets you create music as you draw! It’s a basic music synthesizer that leverages the conductive properties of the pencil lead and can generate musical tones based on its resistance. It’s a lot of fun to draw a piano and be able to play the notes, once you complete the circuit. It runs off a single AA battery, so no need to source a strange cell size. And if you already know how to solder, go ahead and grab this kit anyway. It’s that fun!

HackSpace rated the Drawdio kit 9/10 saying “Fun to Build, fun to draw!”!
