[Oooh this is super early](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader/pull/110), but we love testing out fresh alpha code ![ðŸ™‚](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png) This is maker.makecode.com support for the Circuit Playground Bluefruit (nRF52840) â€“ only a few things work right now: buttons, NeoPixels, speaker and the accelerometer! Definitely doesnâ€™t have wireless support yet, and some things are missing. This isnâ€™t an official supported platform, so [stay tuned](https://youtu.be/Mc8-WnOvgpQ) for more!
