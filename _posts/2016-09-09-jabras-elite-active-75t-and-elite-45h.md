Last year at CES 2019, Jabra wowed us with its Elite 85h headphones. This year at CES 2020, the company is back with two new offerings.

First up is the Elite Active 75t. These truly wireless earbuds are a sport-focused iteration on the existing Elite 75t. The new fitness features include IP57 waterproofing for better protection against sweat. They don’t include active noise cancellation, but you can choose from a variety of colors (which will release in the months following CES).

Their battery life matches the standard model. Expect about 7.5 hours on a single charge, or 28 hours total with the charging case. Jabra will offer the Elite Active 75t starting in February at a recommended price of $199.

Jabra’s other announcement this CES is the Elite 45h, a pair of on-ear headphones. Jabra states that these are “a new standard for headphones in the below $100 category,” as they will retail for $99. They boast an impressive battery, packing 40 hours of listening on a single charge. When in a pinch, you can charge them for 15 minutes to gain eight hours of listening time. 

When we tested the Elite 45h, we were amazed at how light the headphones are. They sit on your head without any pain. In addition, they fold easily, making it a breeze to bring them on the go.

Later in 2020, Jabra plans to release a new functionality called MySound. This will personalize the sound of your headphones based on your level of hearing. It uses a series of beeps, similar to a hearing test, to analyze your listening profile and adjust the audio optimally for you.

While we weren’t able to test this feature at CES, Jabra’s sister company GN Hearing is a well-known manufacturer of hearing aids. Thus, there’s reason to believe it will be a valuable addition.

Whether you’re looking for true wireless earbuds you can wear during a workout or want a solid pair of headphones at an affordable price, Jabra has you covered in 2020.
