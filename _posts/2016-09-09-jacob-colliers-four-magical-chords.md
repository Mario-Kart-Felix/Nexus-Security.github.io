[Jacob Collier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Collier) is the internet’s favorite musical virtuoso. Here’s his mostly acapella arrangement of a Christmas carol called “[In The Bleak Midwinter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Bleak_Midwinter).”

The crazy part of this arrangement comes [between the third and fourth verses](https://youtu.be/mPZn4x3uOac?t=245), when Collier modulates from the key of E to the key of G [half-sharp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter_tone). That is the key which is halfway between G and G-sharp. Modulating there is a bananas thing to do!

Collier explains the modulation in this video:

Over the course of his “four magical chords,” Collier doesn’t just change key, he changes the entire tuning system he’s singing in. He’s able to accomplish this dazzling feat by exploiting the subtle differences between interval sizes [in equal temperament versus the ones in “pure” harmonic tuning](http://www.ethanhein.com/wp/2019/why-cant-you-tune-your-guitar/). Each of the four magical chords is overall a little bit sharper than the one before, but it still sounds in tune because it also shares a tone exactly in common with the previous chord. [David Bruce](http://www.davidbruce.net/) explains how this works in detail in his excellent video – [the crucial part is here](https://youtu.be/Xd54l8gfi7M?t=445).

Jacob Collier has unbelievable technique, no question about that. However, the question is: does all this harmonic trickery result in good music? Or is it just showing off for the sake of showing off?

All of Collier’s music is smooth and attractive, and his harmonies are intellectually fascinating. But for my tastes, the music isn’t as satisfying as it could be. Collier pays too much attention to the chords and not enough to everything else. There are some small production touches on “In The Bleak Midwinter”, for example, the little tinkly bells. But for such a lavish and complex arrangement, the soundscape is surprisingly conservative. I wouldn’t mind hearing fewer modulations and dense jazz chords if it freed up Collier’s creative bandwidth for other aspects of the arrangement and production.

I find the video of Collier explaining the four magical chords to be more emotionally engaging and appealing than the song itself. But it would sound even better looped over some beats. So for a recent [Disquiet Junto](https://disquiet.com/junto/) project, that’s exactly what I did.

Collier first came to my attention from [his viral YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23IHarmU) in which random people sent him short pieces of music and he accompanied them with intricate vocal overdubs. These videos are bottomlessly charming. Collier’s virtuosity is balanced out by the more ordinary-sounding people he’s accompanying, and the short length of the clips keeps him from chasing every idea to florid extremes.

So, Jacob Collier, if you’re reading this: you’ve proved your point, you’re a next-level harmonic genius. But now maybe it’s time to get in the studio with some other people, who maybe don’t have your chops, but who are cooler than you, who listen to more hip-hop and dance music, who can balance out your intellect with some guts. I would love to hear the result.

UPDATES: There are some Jacob Collier fans out there who get [VERY UPSET](https://www.facebook.com/groups/musictheory/permalink/2446261545435136/) if you criticize him.

Also, [Lee Rosevere](https://twitter.com/LeeRosevere) points out that Collier has done some beat-driven electronic music, for example:

This strange meter, whatever it is, is the rhythmic equivalent of modulating to G half-sharp. It’s intellectually interesting, but nobody could actually dance to it. In Dungeons and Dragons terms, the song has astronomical Intelligence, fairly high Charisma, and low to medium Wisdom. I’d rather hear all this craft being poured into a straightahead groove that’s more amenable to audience participation. Collier is [an outspoken Stevie Wonder fan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZP6nogQYPg), but while he has Stevie’s jazzy sophistication, he definitely does not have the soul. And for me, the soul is the important thing.

The one-man-band aspect of Collier’s music is both its most impressive and most limiting feature. It’s awesome that he can do this:

But just because you _can_ do something, doesn’t mean that you have to do it, or even that you should do it. There’s a microcosm of this idea within Collier’s arrangement of “Don’t You Worry ‘Bout A Thing.” It’s at the end of the second chorus, under the line, “’cause I’ll be standin’ on the side while you check it o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-out.” In [Stevie’s original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkBUx6Zn6mo), the word “out” descends over an extraordinary chord progression. It’s in F-sharp, but I transposed this transcription into C for ease of understanding:

How cool is this? As the chords descend chromatically, Stevie keeps the top notes steady, so the third of one chord becomes the suspended fourth of the next one. Then the suspension resolves, and this new third gets held to be the fourth of the next chord. It makes elegant and obvious sense when you hear it. But the progression isn’t “interesting” enough for Collier, I guess. He reharmonizes it to be a lot more complicated, with roots jumping around in thirds and all kinds of strange chord extensions, and the result sounds… okay? I guess? It doesn’t sound nearly as good as Stevie’s original harmony.

Collier’s fans, the ones who are furious at me right now, aspire to his level of multifaceted mastery. Who wouldn’t? But I suspect that the fans are also attracted to the fantasy of being able to do everything alone, without needing to collaborate or compromise with other people. Implicit in that fantasy is the yearning to spend uncountably many hours alone in the practice room. I get it! I don’t like collaboration or compromise either. I find other people annoying most of the time. But it is not my best quality, and the one-man band fantasy is not a healthy one. The only way to get as good at something as Jacob Collier is at singing is to practice it for thousands and thousands of hours. Even if you have no other obligations in your life, no job or family or anything, you still have to sacrifice a lot to put in that many hours. You have to be isolated. And while that isolation can buy you intelligence, it is not very good for your wisdom.
