Intel is putting some serious efforts towards its [sports division](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/sports/sports-overview.html) for making the viewing experience of people better. A couple of weeks back, we saw the tech giant announce its [3D athlete tracking](https://beebom.com/intel-3d-tracking-2020-olympics/) for the 2020 Olympic Games and now, it has unveiled Intel True View for an immersive viewing experience.  

Intel True View is an attempt by Intel to bring an experience close to what the player experiences in the stadium. The chipmaker has teamed up with **Manchester City** to bring the feature to the spotlight.  

With this partnership, Manchester City becomes the first football team in the world to show immersive highlights to its fans. _“We are proud to be the first team in the world to hand fans control of how they view immersive highlights. It is another example of how we continue to apply an innovative mindset to connecting with our fans and running our organization in a dynamic and sustainable way.”,_ said Nuria Tarre, chief marketing officer of City Football Group.  

This technology will let users view the key moments of a match, say a goal, from multiple angles for a better perspective and understanding._ “Intel’s pursuit of next-generation immersive media experiences continues with the launch of immersive highlights, marking another step forward in reimagining the sports experience for fans,”_ said James Carwana, Intel vice president and general manager of Intel Sports.  

Intel True View utilizes a series of cameras that capture “volumetric data” used for generating 360-degree viewing experiences. Fans will get complete control to choose and spin a player for a complete 360-degree perspective. This will help fans understand what the player is actually experiencing in the game if the angle is set to replicate his point of view.  

All this can be experienced from the Manchester City official mobile app. The app is available in Apple’s App Store and Google Play Store. As always, the links to download will be given below. Let us know your thoughts on this new True View technology in the comments.
