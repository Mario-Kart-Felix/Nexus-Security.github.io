TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese factory activity sank to more than a three-year low in October, with the sixth-straight month of contraction largely led by shrinking new orders and output in a fresh warning sign for the world's third-largest economy. The Jibun Bank Final Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dropped to 48.4 on a seasonally adjusted basis, hitting the lowest level since June 2016. The figure was down a notch from last week's preliminary October reading of 48.5, and compared to a final 48.9 in the previous month.
