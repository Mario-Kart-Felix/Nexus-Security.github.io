> Originary, the “tōrō” was an offering to Bouddha, nowadays this japaneese lantern can be found in every garden and shrine.
> 
> I made this lantern (h 82mm) when i was working in Japan to keep a part from this beautiful culture.
> 
> A led, supplied by a battery CR1632 in place of candle brings a peacefull light for hours.  
> The light can be switch on/off by moving up the top and make a 180° rotation (longer led’s leg need to be on + side of the battery for the led to shine).

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
