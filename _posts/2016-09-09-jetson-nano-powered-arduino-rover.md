> What Iâ€™m going to show you today is how to use the Jetson Nano as the brains of a rover. If you already have an Arduino powered rover/bot, you can easily add the Jetson Nano as a high-level decision making circuit that can make decisions off of input like Images, Video, Sound basically any sensor data.
> 
> The first part of the code consists of an Arduino sketch that shows how to use a simple binary communication protocol that can send and receive integers, floating points etc. The Arduino here acts as a client. [Communication.h](https://github.com/hazkaz/roverCode/blob/master/beachRover-v1-arduino/Communication.h)defines the interface for sending sensor data.
