Besieged with [controversies over illegal content in India](https://beebom.com/tiktok-ban-loss/) and [facing an investigation in the US](https://beebom.com/us-government-tiktok-national-security-investigation/) over national security concerns, ByteDance, the parent company of viral video-streaming app, TikTok, has unveiled its first smartphone in China. To be marketed under the Smartisan brand, the device is named **Jianguo Pro 3**, which curiously translates to ‘Nut Pro 3’ in English.  

A quick glance at some of the phone’s features reveals that while it does sport some flagship-grade hardware, the focus is well and truly on the various software features that the company believes will appeal to aspiring TikTok stars. The device comes with selfie-lighting and also offers direct access to the TikTok app with a single swipe on the lock-screen.
