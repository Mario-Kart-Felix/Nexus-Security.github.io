Jocelyn Bell Burnell is a shining star of inspirational women in STEM. In the 60’s Bell Burnell discovered [Pulsars](https://www.space.com/32661-pulsars.html). At the time she was [passed over](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1974/summary/) for recognition when her advisor received the Nobel prize.

> “She represents something very important in our recent history,” said Janna Levin, an astrophysicist at Barnard College of Columbia University. “She has tenacity, and ingenuity, and originality of thought, and a long legacy as an astronomer . . . that reaches into all branches of physics. I’m absolutely thrilled.”

> “The assumption was that the boys would do science and the girls would do cookery and needlework,” she said. “It was such a firm assumption that it wasn’t even discussed, so there was no choice in the matter.”

> But Bell Burnell would not be denied. She had read her father’s astronomy books cover to cover, teaching herself the jargon and grappling with complex concepts until she felt she could comprehend the universe.

Happy [Ada Lovelace Day!](http://findingada.com) Today, in honor of Ada Lovelace, the world celebrates all of the accomplishments of women in science, art, design, technology, engineering, and math. Each year, [Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/random/ald/) highlights a number of women who are pioneering their fields and inspiring women of all ages to make their voices heard. Today we will be sharing the stories of women that we think are modern day “Adas” alongside historical women that have made impacts in science and math.
