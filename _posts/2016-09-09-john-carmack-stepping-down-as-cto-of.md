The chief technology officer of Oculus, Facebook's VR subsidiary, is stepping down this week, he [posted on Facebook today](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2547632585471243&id=100006735798590). John Carmack, who was the lead programmer on _Doom_ and who put [the Oculus Rift on the map](https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/30/3052191/doom-3-bfg-edition-announced-for-the-fall-we-try-it-with-john) in 2012, says he plans to focus his time instead on artificial intelligence.

Carmack will remain in a "consulting CTO" position at Oculus, where he will "still have a voice" in the development work at the company, he wrote.

Carmack joined Oculus as [CTO in 2013,](https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/7/4597678/doom-and-quake-id-software-john-carmack-joins-oculus-as-cto) leaving id Software, the maker of _Doom_, which he'd co-founded. In March 2014, Facebook announced it would acquire Oculus. In May 2014, ZeniMax Media, id's parent company, [sued Oculus,](https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/21/5739086/oculus-vr-and-its-founder-sued-by-zenimax-and-id-software) alleging that misappropriated trade secrets were used to build development tools for the Oculus Rift. The two companies [settled last December](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/12/18138129/facebook-zenimax-oculus-vr-settlement-announced).

Recent comments from Carmack suggest he may have soured on VR. Carmack was a champion of phone-based VR for years at Oculus, but in October, he [delivered a "eulogy"](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20915791/google-daydream-samsung-oculus-gear-vr-mobile-vr-platforms-dead) for Oculus' phone-based Gear VR. And in a video for [receiving a lifetime achievement award](https://www.pcgamer.com/john-carmack-says-hes-not-satisfied-with-the-pace-of-progress-in-vr-development/) this week at the VR Awards, he said that "I really haven't been satisfied with the pace of progress that we've been making" in VR.
