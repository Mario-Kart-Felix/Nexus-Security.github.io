Turning around the mess that is WeWork isn't going to be up to John Legere. [According to CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/15/john-legere-isnt-leaving-t-mobile-to-take-wework-ceo-job.html), the current T-Mobile CEO does not intend to take the chief executive role, despite rumors earlier this week that WeWork was strongly pursuing him.

Legere "has no plans" to depart T-Mobile as it nears completion of its merger with Sprint, CNBC says. Both the Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission have greenlit the combined mega-carrier, but it still faces one final challenge: numerous state attorneys general are attempting to block the deal with a lawsuit.

Through his brash presentation style and a series of "Uncarrier" customer initiatives, Legere is credited for helming T-Mobile's impressive comeback from a stagnant fourth place position among US carriers into a company that continues to see strong growth. Though T-Mobile is the third-largest carrier right now, it will become far more powerful when it adds Sprint's customers to its ranks.

Earlier this month, T-Mobile announced the first programs it will launch if and when the Sprint deal successfully goes through, including [free 5G service](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20953330/tmobile-sprint-first-responders-free-5g-ten-years-merger-connecting-heroes) for first responders and "Project 10Million," an effort to [bring free internet to 10 million under-connected homes](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20953425/tmobile-sprint-merger-homework-gap-5g-for-good). Both are fairly blatant goodwill moves meant to drum up support for the merger.

Had Legere shifted over to WeWork, it would've raised some eyebrows. [Softbank, which now controls WeWork](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20928050/softbank-wework-buyout-marcelo-claure), is also the majority owner of Sprint — until T-Mobile's acquisition of the company is complete, at least. And Marcelo Claure, who campaigned for the industry-changing merger beside Legere, was recently elected executive chairman of WeWork.
