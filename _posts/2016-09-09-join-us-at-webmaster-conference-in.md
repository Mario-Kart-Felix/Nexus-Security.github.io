Earlier this year [we announced a series](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/06/webmaster-conference.html) of Webmaster Conferences being held around the world to help website creators understand how to optimize their sites for Search. We’ve already held 22 of these events, [with more planned](https://events.withgoogle.com/wmc/) through the end of the year. Building on the success of these events so far, we’re hosting a [product summit version of this event](https://events.withgoogle.com/webmaster-conference-mtv/) at the Google Headquarters in Mountain View on Monday November 4th.

This event is designed to facilitate an open dialog between the webmaster and SEO community and Search product teams. This one-day event will include talks from Search product managers, Q&A sessions, and a product fair giving attendees the opportunity to have direct conversations with product managers. Attendees will learn from the people building Search about how they think about the evolution of the platform, and have the opportunity to share feedback about the needs of the community.  
  
We also realize that not everyone will be able to make this event in person, so we plan to share out much of the content and feedback after the event.  
  
If you’re interested and able to make it, we [encourage you to apply today](https://events.withgoogle.com/webmaster-conference-mtv/) as space is limited. Complete details about the event and the application process can be found on the [event registration site.](https://events.withgoogle.com/webmaster-conference-mtv/) And as always, you can check out our other upcoming events on the [general Webmaster Conference site](https://events.withgoogle.com/wmc/), the Google Webmasters [event calendar](https://www.google.com/webmasters/connect), or follow our blogs and [@googlewmc](https://twitter.com/googlewmc/) on Twitter!
