**JSONBee - A Ready To Use JSONP Endpoints/Payloads To Help Bypass Content Security Policy Of Different Websites**

A ready to use JSONP [endpoints](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Endpoints "endpoints") to help bypass content security policy of different websites.  
The tool was presented during HackIT 2018 in Kiev. The presentation can be found here (not sure why format of the slides is screwed :D): [https://www.slideshare.net/Hacken\_Ecosystem/ebrahem-hegazy-bug-hunters-manual-for-bypassing-contentsecuritypolicy](https://www.slideshare.net/Hacken_Ecosystem/ebrahem-hegazy-bug-hunters-manual-for-bypassing-contentsecuritypolicy "https://www.slideshare.net/Hacken_Ecosystem/ebrahem-hegazy-bug-hunters-manual-for-bypassing-contentsecuritypolicy")

**What is JSONBee?**  
The main idea behind this tool is to find the JSONP endpoint(s) that would help you bypass content security policy for your target [website](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Website "website") in an automated way. JSONBee takes an input of a url name (i.e. [https://www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/ "https://www.facebook.com")), parses the CSP (Content-Security-Policy), and automatically suggest the [XSS](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/XSS "XSS")[payload](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Payload "payload") that would bypass the CSP. It mainly focuses on JSONP endpoints gathered during my bug bounty hunting activities, and could be used to bypass the CSP.  
JSONBee relies on 3 methods to gather the JSONP endpoints:

*   The repository within this project;
*   Google dorks;
*   Internet archive (archive.org).

The tool is not yet fully completed as I'm still adding some validations and features too. However, the repository will be hosted here so that anyone can use it till the tool is ready.  
The repo contains ready-to-use payloads that can bypass CSP for [Facebook.com](http://facebook.com/), [Google.com](http://google.com/) and more.  
**Bypasing [Facebook.com](http://facebook.com/) Content-Security policy:**  
[Facebook.com](http://facebook.com/) allows \*.[google.com](http://google.com/) in its CSP policy (script-src directive), thus, below payload would work like a charm to execute JavaScript on [Facebook.com](http://facebook.com/): `">https://cse.google.com/api/007627024705277327428/cse/r3vs7b0fcli/queries/js?callback=alert(1337)">`  
If you came across a website that trusts any of the domains in jsonp.txt file in its script-src directive, then pickup a payload that matches the domain and have fun :)  
  
**How can you help?**  
You are all welcome to contribute by adding links to sites that uses JSONP endpoins/callbacks to make the repo bigger and more usefull for bug hunters, pentesters, and security researchers.
