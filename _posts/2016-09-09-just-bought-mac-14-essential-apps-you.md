Apple bundles plenty of utilities with macOS, but there are some other useful tools you should download to get the most out of your Mac. Here are some picks many Mac fans swear by.

Magnet: Keep Your Windows Organized
-----------------------------------

Apple still hasn’t included a Windows-like “Aero-snap” feature in macOS that allows you to organize your workspace quickly while you work. Fortunately, the developer community has solved this issue numerous times, and [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) ($2) is one of the best solutions.

Simply click and drag a window until you see the required outline appear, and then release to scale the window appropriately. You can also use keyboard shortcuts to move windows into position. Windows remember their place until you move them again, even if you log out of your Mac.

Alfred: Get More Done in Less Time
----------------------------------

[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is a productivity powerhouse for your Mac. It helps you do more things in less time with hotkeys, keywords, and actions. You can build custom workflows or download prebuilt ones the online community has shared.

It does a bit of everything. You can use it as a more intelligent version of Apple’s Spotlight search or to manage your clipboard history. You can also string actions together and execute them with a single command to automate tasks. The basic version of Alfred is free to download and try. To unlock the full set of features, you can purchase the [Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) (£23).

MPV or VLC: Play Any Media File
-------------------------------

QuickTime offers basic media playback on macOS, but there are many formats QuickTime cannot open. For these, you need a more capable media player, like [MPV](https://mpv.io/). This app is a free, open-source fork of the much-celebrated mplayer2 and MPlayer projects. It plays both video and audio.
