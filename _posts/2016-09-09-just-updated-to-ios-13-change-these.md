Did you know you can now reject all unknown calls on your iPhone to block telemarketing and scam phone calls? This is just one of the useful new settings Apple included in September’s [iOS 13](https://www.howtogeek.com/440039/the-best-new-features-in-ios-13/) update for iPhones and iPads.

Disable Shake-to-Undo
---------------------

iOS 13 includes some [powerful hidden text-editing gestures](https://www.howtogeek.com/441872/how-to-use-text-editing-gestures-on-your-iphone-and-ipad/). Many of these gestures work anywhere in the OS, not just while editing text. You can now undo changes by:

*   Swiping left on the screen with three fingers** or**
*   Double-tapping the screen with three fingers

You can finally say goodbye to Apple’s least useful “gesture”—shake to undo. Head to Settings > Accessibility > Touch and toggle “Shake to Undo” to off. This option has been here for a long time, but in iOS 13, Apple has finally provided some alternative gestures.

You can also redo a change by swiping right on the screen with three fingers. Use these new gestures to undo or redo changes like moving an email message to the wrong folder and in third-party apps that support undo and redo functionality.

When you upgrade, iOS 13 asks whether you want to [enable the brand new Dark Mode](https://www.howtogeek.com/440078/how-to-enable-dark-mode-on-your-iphone-and-ipad/). If you rushed through the initial setup process, you might have missed it, or you might want to try switching between light and dark themes automatically.
