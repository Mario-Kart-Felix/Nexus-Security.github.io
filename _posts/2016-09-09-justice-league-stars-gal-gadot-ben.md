The "#ReleaseTheSnyderCut" fans, who seek an official release of Zack Snyder's cut of [Justice League](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/justice-league-review-a-fresh-start/1100-6454954/) from Warner Bros., have today received support from three of the film's stars on the two year anniversary of the film's cinema release. Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman), Ben Affleck (Batman), and Ray Fisher (Cyborg) have all tweeted today using the "#ReleaseTheSnyderCut" hashtag, indicating that they would also like the film's original director's final cut to be released.

The tweets from Gadot and Affleck have been retweeted by [Zack Snyder](https://twitter.com/ZackSnyder) himself, along with the comments "This ancient Amazonian canâ€™t be wrong" and "Neither can Batman." Snyder has previously [thrown shade](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/justice-league-co-director-zack-snyder-mocks-super/1100-6457092/) at the CGI work in the final version of Justice League, and spoken about why his version of Batman [kills people](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zack-snyder-thinks-dc-fans-should-wake-the-f-up-ab/1100-6465843/). This is the first major sign we've gotten that Snyder himself wants to see the release of his own final cut of the film--he has previously [confirmed its existence](https://screenrant.com/justice-league-zack-snyder-cut-exists-confirmed/), but has not been vocal over the cut's release.

"#ReleaseTheSnyderCut" stems from the fact that Snyder [stepped away](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/justice-league-director-drops-out-after-family-tra/1100-6450245/) from the film's post-production in May 2017 following a family tragedy. Joss Whedon was brought in to finish the film, which involved shooting new scenes and making some tweaks to its structure and story. Since the film's release fans have wanted to see a version of Justice League that was entirely in line with Snyder's plan and vision for it. At the time of release, star Ben Affleck said that the movie represented "[Snyder's DNA](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/justice-league-movie-is-zack-snyders-dna-despite-b/1100-6454669/)."

In July 2018, Warner Bros. stated that they had [no intention](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zack-snyder-cut-of-justice-league-movie-isnt-happe/1100-6460537/) of releasing a Snyder cut of the movie. Snyder also directed DC movies Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and is still the sole credited director on Justice League, with Whedon receiving a screenwriting credit. Stars Henry Cavill (Superman) and Ezra Miller (The Flash) have not commented on the Snyder Cut, but Jason Momoa (Aquaman) posted the hashtag on Instagram a week ago. He has also previously claimed to have [seen the cut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kpd9GIHbbhQ).

Despite all of this, there's no definitive sign that the Snyder Cut of Justice League will actually release. The film's original release ended with a disappointing worldwide box office take of $657,924,295; by comparison, the most recent DC film, Joker, has [just passed the $1 billion mark](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/joker-to-cross-1-billion-and-become-one-of-the-mos/1100-6471513/), as did Aquaman.
