================================================================================================================================

_**STATUS: EXPERIMENT - Let me know what you think**_

`k3c` is a local container engine designed to fill the same gap Docker does in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Specifically `k3c` focuses on developing and running local containers, basically `docker run/build`. Currently `k3s`, the [lightweight Kubernetes distribution](https://github.com/rancher/k3s), provides a great solution for Kubernetes from dev to production. While `k3s` satisifies the Kubernetes runtime needs, one still needs to run `docker` (or a docker-like tool) to actually develop and build the container images. `k3c` is intended to replace `docker` for just the functionality needed for the Kubernetes ecosystem.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

There really is nothing better than the classic Docker UX of `run/build/push/pull`. This tool copies the same UX as classic Docker (think Docker v1.12). The intention is to follow the same style but not be a 100% drop in replacement. Behaviour and arguements have been changed to better match the behavior of the Kubernetes ecosystem. One change, for example, is that start/restart will always give you a fresh container because pods in Kubernetes are always ephemeral.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

`k3c`, similar to `k3s` and old school docker, is packaged as a single binary, because nothing is easier than a static binary for distribution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fundamentally `k3c` is a built on the [Container Runtime Interface (CRI)](https://github.com/kubernetes/cri-api). In fact it's really like a nicer version of of [cri-tool](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools). CRI doesn't cover image building and some other small image tasks like tag and push. For image building Moby's [buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit) is used internally, and for other things OCI's [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd) is used.

------------------------------------------------------------------

`k3c` runs as a daemon either as root or one per user for rootless support. **NOTE: root less isn't currently working, that's just the design right now**. The daemon exposes a GRPC API. For building the buildkit API is just exposed directly from the k3c socket. `containerd`, `buildkitd`, and `containerd-cri` are all embedded directly into the k3c binary.

--------------------------------------------------------

Start the daemon as root (rootless will be supported in the future if this project takes off)

Run containers like you would with `docker`

```
$ ./k3c --help NAME: k3c - Lightweight local container platform USAGE: k3c [global options] command [command options] [arguments...] VERSION: dev (HEAD) COMMANDS: create Create a new container attach Attach local standard input, output, and error streams to a running container stop Stop one or more running containers start Start one or more stopped containers logs Fetch the logs of a container rm Remove one or more containers exec Run a command in a running container run Run a command in a new container ps List containers build Build an image from a Dockerfile images List images tag Create a tag TARGET_IMAGE that refers to SOURCE_IMAGE pull Pull an image or a repository from a registry rmi Remove one or more images push Push an image or a repository to a registry inspect Return low-level information on k3c objects events Get real time events from the server daemon Run the container daemon volume, volumes, v Manage volumes help, h Shows a list of commands or help for one command 
```

--------------------------------------------------------

Right now this is just an experiment. If there is sufficient interest I expect I'll integrate `k3s` + `k3c` + `k3os` + `k3d` to create a full `k3` end to end container solution that will fully encompass all aspects of the container development life cycle.

Windows and macOS can be fully supported to in the future.
