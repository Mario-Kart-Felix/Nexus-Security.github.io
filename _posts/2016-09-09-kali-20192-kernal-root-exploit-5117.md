Kali 2019.2 Kernal Root Exploit | 5.1.17 kernel | CVE-2019-13272 | Viluhacker  
  
Current Description  
  
In the Linux kernel before 5.1.17, ptrace\_link in kernel/ptrace.c mishandles the recording of the credentials of a process that wants to create a ptrace relationship, which allows local users to obtain root access by leveraging certain scenarios with a parent-child process relationship, where a parent drops privileges and calls execve (potentially allowing control by an attacker). One contributing factor is an object lifetime issue (which can also cause a panic). Another contributing factor is incorrect marking of a ptrace relationship as privileged, which is exploitable through (for example) Polkit's pkexec helper with PTRACE\_TRACEME. NOTE: SELinux deny\_ptrace might be a usable workaround in some environments.
