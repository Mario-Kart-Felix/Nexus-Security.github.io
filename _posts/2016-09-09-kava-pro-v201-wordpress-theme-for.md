Among the many [sandbox games](https://beebom.com/sanbox-games-like-minecraft/), Roblox is quite popular for its build-your-world theme. In fact, Roblox is not just a game, but a platform too where you can develop your own game with distinct plots, characters, environment and more. Interestingly, [Roblox is available on Chromebook](https://beebom.com/how-play-roblox-chromebook/) and you can install it on your machine easily. However, if you want to play something like Roblox, but with a different strategy and mind-bending plot then we have some interesting recommendations for you. In this article, we bring you a list of games like Roblox which are known for their complex survival strategy and stellar graphics. So on that note, let’s begin and find out the best games like Roblox on Chromebook.  

Games Like Roblox on Chromebook
-------------------------------

  

Here, we have included games like Roblox primarily from the Google Play Store and Steam. In case you aren’t aware, you can easily install and [play Steam games on your Chromebook](https://beebom.com/how-install-play-steam-games-chromebook/) using the [Linux container on Chrome OS](https://beebom.com/how-use-linux-chromebook/). So, go ahead and set up Steam on your Chromebook. Apart from that, [enable GPU acceleration in Linux](https://beebom.com/enable-microphone-gpu-acceleration-linux-chromebook/) on your Chromebook for smoother and high-quality gameplay. Now having done that, let’s make our way to games similar to Robox on Chromebook.  

1\. Minecraft
-------------

  

One of the most famous and most played titles in the sandbox genre is Minecraft and a game that is very similar to Roblox. Minecraft lets you construct buildings in its procedurally generated world. It not only allows the players to use unlimited resources to create and build beautiful bases but also **includes exploration, crafting, and combat, to maintain health while surviving the harsh world**. Minecraft also provides a multiplayer layer to its game where the players can create and share the different maps to play in. Not to mention, Minecraft runs quite well on Chromebook after the last few updates. So go ahead and enjoy this popular sandbox game on your Chromebook.

2\. Stardew Valley
------------------

  

Stardew Valley is the only game that comes close to Roblox in terms of gameplay complexity. Sure, it has linear gameplay, unlike the 3D environment in Roblox, but it takes the survival strategy to a whole new level and expands on it. The game **offers an even larger world than many of the games available on Roblox where you get to enjoy your farm life, grow crops, raise poultry**, and many farm gimmicks that you love performing. Stardew Valley is considered one of the top Roblox alternatives and you should definitely give it a try.

3\. Terraria
------------

  

Terraria is another popular sandbox game just like Roblox where you have to explore the deep expanse of forest to survive yourself. I love this game, particularly because **it runs absolutely great on both Android and Steam versions**. As for the game, you begin with a pickaxe and a sword to find resources as well as to defend yourself from zombies and flying eyes. However, keep in the mind, unlike Roblox’s 3D gameplay, here you have a 2D game in a linear progression. Basically, you won’t be able to roam around anywhere and have to stick to one path. But the best part about Terraria is that there are exciting explorations, crafting, combat, and mining for which Roblox games are extremely popular.

4\. Blockheads
--------------

  

Blockheads is a classic game like many of the games available on Roblox (Banland, Chaos Canyon). At its heart, it’s an action-survival sandbox video game where you can freely roam around and create your world. Similar to Roblox, here **you can explore deserts, forests, mountains, and all the wilderness to build your shelter and stay alive.** There are also complex caves and snowy mountain tops that you have to survive using the collected resources. However, do note that it’s not a 3D generated world like Roblox. Apart from that, the Android version of this game works really well on Chromebook and does not stutter a bit.

5\. Block Story
---------------

  

Block Story is a [role-playing video game](https://beebom.com/best-rpgs-android/), set in a distant land where weird creatures have taken over your biome and you are on a run to save to your life. It mimics the theme of Roblox really well and the graphics are also great. The interesting part of Block Story is its layered plot. During the gameplay, **you will find some creatures who can help you if you complete a quest. Upon doing so, you get a reward** and using that, you can get anything including dragons, weapons, and armors. After completing multiple quests, you can gather enough power to fight off the attackers and free people from the terror. Simply put, it’s a classic game of survival and you should not miss it also because it runs phenomenally well on Chromebook.

6\. More Android Games Like Roblox
----------------------------------

  

Apart from the games mentioned above, there are some Android games like Roblox which we tried on our Chromebook, but they didn’t run. It may be because our Chromebook has an Intel-based processor and Android games are generally developed for ARM chips. So **in case, you have an ARM-based Chromebook**, give these games a try and see if it works on your machine.
