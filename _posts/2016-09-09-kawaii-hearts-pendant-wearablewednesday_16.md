From Team Kawaii Tech: Natalia Coria, Abraham Contreras on [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/kawaii-tech/kawaii-hearts-pendant-949cf9):

> We were inspired by [IObrizio pin badges](https://twitter.com/IObrizio) and [Gustavo Reynaga oshwi](https://twitter.com/gsreynaga) and wanted to have a small and simple design to be used as a pendant.
> 
> We based the design on [Kawaii Tech Logo](https://www.instagram.com/kawaiitechmx/) it is our first KICAD project ![ðŸ˜›](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f61b.png)
