Have you ever wanted a way to keep track of how you’re spending time on your PC? ActivityWatch might just be the tool you’re looking for.  

ActivityWatch is a [**time-tracking software**](https://beebom.com/how-track-time-mac/) that helps you keep an eye on all your activities on your machine. The developer claims it to be an attempt to replace existing apps like RescueTime, ManicTime, and WakaTime.  

The app shows you a detailed summary of the time you spend on various applications on your PC. It has various categories like “Top Applications”, “Top Window Titles”, and even “Top Browser domains” so that you can get a better idea.

“Top Browser domains” lets you know the website on which you spend the most time on while “Top Window Titles” shows the tab name you use extensively. You also get an option to filter out the time you were away from the keyboard to get the exact time statistics by checking the “**Filter away AFK time**” checkbox.  

In case you’re wondering, ActivityWatch is [**open-source**](https://beebom.com/open-source-apps-android/) and you can view the source code of the app [here](https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch). Thanks to its cross-platform nature, ActivityWatch is available on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
