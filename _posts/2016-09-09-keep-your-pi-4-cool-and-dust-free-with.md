Don’t run your Pi 4 without a case. That’s just criminal. Here are some great cases that can keep your Pi 4 cool and dust-free in any situation.

What to Look for in a Pi 4 Case
-------------------------------

Raspberry Pis can be used to accomplish [just about anything](https://www.reviewgeek.com/19098/16-cool-projects-for-your-new-raspberry-pi-4/). Need a smart mirror? [You can build one](https://www.howtogeek.com/414647/how-to-build-a-smart-mirror/) with a Pi. Want a powerful media center? Set it up on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.howtogeek.com/163541/build-a-35-media-center-with-raspbmc-and-raspberry-pi-redux/).

But all this flexibility can make it hard to find a good Raspberry Pi case. Some cases are meant for everyday applications, but others are made specifically for smarthome setups, entertainment centers, or intensive applications (which can generate a lot of heat).

So before shopping for a Pi case, you should stop and think of what you need. Here are some of the features that you might need in a Pi 4 case:

*   **Heat Dissipation**: If you plan to use your Pi 4 for intensive actives or extended periods, then you should probably get a nice, cool case. Aluminum cases with fans and heat-sinks are the coolest option, but most people can get away with the bare minimum, like a case with one fan or decent ventilation.
*   **GPIO/Module Access**: All of the Pi cases listed in this article provide easy access to the GPIO and module pins, but some give a bit of extra wiggle room for cables. If you want to use accessories like camera modules or with your Pi, then try to find a case with extra cable room.
*   **Assembly**: Most Raspberry Pi cases are really easy to assemble. But some cheap cases are made from stacked pieces of acrylic (like a case that’s been sliced into bologna), and they’re really a pain to assemble. If you don’t feel like dealing with that extra work, then shell out for a more expensive case.
*   **Labeling**: Clear or unlabeled cases can make it harder to locate the Pi 4’s ports. If you want a case that won’t confuse your family or roommates, then try to find one that’s opaque and labeled.

Alright, now that you know what you’re looking for, it’s time to start shopping for your new Raspberry Pi 4 case.

Before we get starts, it’s worth mentioning that the Pi 4 Model B is still a relatively new product. We’ll cover a lot of different cases in this article, but some popular case styles, like retro game console cases, aren’t manufactured for the Pi 4 just yet.

All-Purpose Cases (Great for Entertainment Centers)
---------------------------------------------------

Anidees, Argon Forty

Some cases, like the [official Raspberry Pi 4 case](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-case/), are meant to fit in just about any situation. These cases usually have attractive designs, adequate cooling, and ample room for cables. They’re also pretty easy to put together, although they tend to cost more than your typical Raspberry Pi case.

We’d suggest using these cases for media centers or desktops. If you plan to push your Pi to the limit, you may want to find an all-purpose case that comes with fans or check out the super cooling cases further in this article.

Here are a few fantastic all-purpose cases:

*   [**Pi 4 Official Case**](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-case/): The official Pi 4 case from the Raspberry Pi Foundation. It’s an attractive, easy to assemble case that leaves ample room for internal cables.
*   **[Flirc Silver Case](https://www.amazon.com/Flirc-Raspberry-Pi-Case-Silver/dp/B07WG4DW52/?tag=reviewgeek-20)**: This attractive, affordable, easy to assemble case is a great option for intense or casual Pi 4 projects. It effectively dissipates heat with its raised feet and aluminum heat-sinks, and you can easily access the Pi’s GPIO and main connectors through the bottom of the case. Flirc also sells this case [with Kodi branding](https://flirc.tv/more/kodi-edition-raspberry-pi-4-case).
*   **[Anidees Premium](https://www.amazon.com/anidees-Aluminum-Extra-Raspberry-Model/dp/B07WWPGQX3/?tag=reviewgeek-20) [Case](https://www.amazon.com/anidees-Aluminum-Extra-Raspberry-Model/dp/B07WWPGQX3/?tag=reviewgeek-20)**: Anidees’ premium Pi 4 cases are sleek, easy to assemble, and well ventilated. They also have noise-dampening feet, holes for wall mounting, and enough interior room for GPIO and main connector access.
*   [**Anidees Extra-Tall Case**](https://www.amazon.com/anidees-Aluminum-Extra-Raspberry-Model/dp/B07WPLDVQJ/?tag=reviewgeek-20): A high-quality case that’s easy to assemble. This case is nearly identical to the Anidees premium case, but it has a bit of extra headroom for cables and modules.
*   [**Argon One Mini Computer Case**](https://www.amazon.com/Argon-Computer-Raspberry-Aluminum-Enclosure/dp/B07WP9P8VW/?tag=reviewgeek-20): As of right now, this is the only Pi 4 case that actually looks like a computer case or game console. It’s well ventilated, comes with a USB-C power supply, has a removable magnetic top, and actually has a GPIO label printed on its backside for on-the-fly modifications.
*   [**GeeekPi Fan ABS Case**](https://www.amazon.com/GeeekPi-Raspberry-Cooling-40X40X10mm-Heatsink/dp/B07XBKPZ87?tag=reviewgeek-20): A simple case that comes with a large 40mm fan. It’s easy to assemble or take apart, and it has two pre-installed wall-mounting holes.
