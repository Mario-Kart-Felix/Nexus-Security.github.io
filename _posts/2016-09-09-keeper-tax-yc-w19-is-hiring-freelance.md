We're TurboTax for US gig workers. The cool part? We scan your entire year's worth of purchases for tax write offs that most people miss. https://ift.tt/2lY6rZH

We've raised ~$2M, and have around 10K subscribers.

We're looking for someone to join on short-ish notice and help us with some web development. Mostly react & node.

It can definitely turn into a full-time opportunity, if that's what you're interested in.

Are you a good fit? Send a note to paul@keepertax.com
