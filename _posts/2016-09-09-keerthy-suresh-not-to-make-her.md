Earlier it has been fixed that [Keerthy Suresh](https://www.instagram.com/keerthysureshofficial/?hl=en), national award-winning South actor was all set to be launched in Bollywood opposite [Ajay Devgn](https://twitter.com/ajaydevgn?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) in Amit Sharma’s sports drama, [Maidaan](https://twitter.com/hashtag/maidaan?lang=en). However, she has now opted out of the film.

  

Keerthy and producer Boney Kapoor mutually agreed that she should no longer be a part of the project, as she would be too young for the role. She was supposed to play the wife of Ajay, who is essaying the role of former football coach and manager of the Indian national team Syed Abdul Rahim, under whose guidance the Indian team reached the semi-finals of the 1956 Melbourne Olympics.

  

There were reservations about the 27-year-old Keerthy playing an older character again after Mahanati, which showed the journey of former South superstar Savitri from her first film to her death at the age of 45. The actor as well as Boney felt that she could be typecast and be offered only roles that were older, which could hamper her prospects in Bollywood. The two of them amicably decided that she should pick a different film to make her Hindi debut with.[Keerthy Suresh not to make her Bollywood debut in Ajay Devgn’s Maidaan](https://varindia.com/news/keerthy-suresh-not-to-make-her-bollywood-debut-in-ajay-devgns-maidaan#.XiKytquCGAU.blogger):
