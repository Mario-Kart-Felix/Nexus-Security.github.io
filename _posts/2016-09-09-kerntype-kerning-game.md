Sorry, your browser doesn't support KernType
============================================

I'm really sorry; I've put a lot of effort into making this game run on as many platforms as possible. Unfortunately, I am unable to cover all scenarios. The game works on [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome), [Firefox](http://www.getfirefox.com), [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/), [Opera](http://www.opera/browser/) and [Internet Explorer 9](http://www.beautyoftheweb.com/). If you try one of those and still have problems, let me know.

Thanks for your interest in KernType!
