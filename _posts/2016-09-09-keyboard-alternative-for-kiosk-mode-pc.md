> Case I use to control a kiosk mode PC (without keyboard). Made with a simple sketch on an Arduino Leonardo pro mini.

> The lid is tightened with M2.5 bolts. The case has threaded brass mounts to fit the bolts. Texts on top of the lid can be changed in the OpenScad file ![ðŸ™‚](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png)
