From [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/Keytar-Hero-Using-a-Wii-Guitar-Controller-As-a-Syn/) (via [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2020/01/07/guitar-hero-controller-gets-a-new-musical-life/)) is a Wii guitar turned into a synthesizer (Keytar Hero) by [Analog Sketchbook](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCammvfEA07DIsA_xLhjEQpg).

> The Guitar Hero games were all the rage a dozen years ago, so there’s bound to be a lot of old guitar controllers lying around gathering dust. They have a lot of buttons, knobs, and levers, so why not put them to good use again? The guitar controller doesn’t normally make any sound on its own, but in this tutorial I’ll show you how to convert a Wii Guitar Hero Controller so it can be played as a synthesizer.

**Supplies:**

*   Guitar Hero Wii Controller
*   Nunchucky breakout board (available on Adafruit [here](https://www.adafruit.com/product/345))
*   [4ea jumper wires](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1950) (female to female)
*   2ea crimp connectors (optional)
*   [Raspberry Pi](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4296) (3 B+ or 4 preferred)
*   [16GB MicroSD card](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2693)

The project uses a Raspberry Pi with Pure data and Python code available on [GitHub here](https://github.com/analogsketchbook/keytarHero).
