**Laurence Kim Peek** (November 11, 1951 – December 19, 2009) was an [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_of_the_United_States "People of the United States") [savant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savant_syndrome "Savant syndrome"). Known as a "megasavant",[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek#cite_note-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek#cite_note-3) he had an [exceptional memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exceptional_memory "Exceptional memory"), but he also experienced social difficulties, possibly resulting from a [developmental disability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_disability "Developmental disability") related to congenital [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain "Human brain") abnormalities. He was the inspiration for the autistic savant character Raymond Babbitt in the movie _[Rain Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_Man "Rain Man")_. Although Peek was previously diagnosed with [autism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum "Autism spectrum"), it is now thought that he instead had [FG syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FG_syndrome "FG syndrome").[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek#cite_note-Weber2009-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek#cite_note-Opitz_JM,_Smith_JF,_Santoro_L_2008_123%E2%80%9370-5)

Early life
----------

Peek was born in [Salt Lake City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City "Salt Lake City"), [Utah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah "Utah")[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek#cite_note-Times_Obit-6) with [macrocephaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrocephaly "Macrocephaly"),[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek#cite_note-Opitz_JM,_Smith_JF,_Santoro_L_2008_123%E2%80%9370-5) damage to the [cerebellum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum "Cerebellum"), and [agenesis of the corpus callosum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenesis_of_the_corpus_callosum "Agenesis of the corpus callosum"),[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek#cite_note-realrainman-7) a condition in which the bundle of nerves that connects the two hemispheres of the brain is missing; in Peek's case, secondary connectors such as the [anterior commissure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_commissure "Anterior commissure") were also missing.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek#cite_note-Opitz_JM,_Smith_JF,_Santoro_L_2008_123%E2%80%9370-5) There is speculation that his neurons [made unusual connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity "Neuroplasticity") due to the absence of a corpus callosum, resulting in an increased memory capacity.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek#cite_note-wms-8)[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek#cite_note-9) According to Peek's father, Fran (Francis) Peek, Kim was able to memorize things from the age of 16–20 months. He read books, memorized them, and then placed them upside down on the shelf to show that he had finished reading them, a practice he maintained all his life. He could speed through a book in about an hour and remember almost everything he had read, memorizing vast amounts of information in subjects ranging from history and literature, geography and numbers to sports, music and dates. Peek read by scanning the left page with his left eye, then the right page with his right eye. According to an article in _[The Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times "The Times")_ newspaper, he could accurately recall the contents of at least 12,000 books.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek#cite_note-Times_Obit-6) Peek lived in [Murray, Utah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray,_Utah "Murray, Utah"), and spent a considerable amount of his time reading at the [Salt Lake City Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City_Library "Salt Lake City Library") and demonstrating his capabilities at schools, with great help from his father.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek#cite_note-sltrib-10)

Peek did not walk until he was four years old, and then in a sidelong manner.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek#cite_note-wms-8) He could not button up his shirt and had difficulty with other ordinary motor skills, presumably due to his damaged cerebellum, which normally coordinates motor activities. In psychological testing, Peek scored low average (87) on general [IQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient "Intelligence quotient") tests.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek#cite_note-11)

_Rain Man_
----------

In 1984, [screenwriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenwriter "Screenwriter") [Barry Morrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Morrow "Barry Morrow") met Peek in [Arlington, Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas "Arlington, Texas"); the result of the meeting was the 1988 movie _[Rain Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_Man "Rain Man")_. The character of Raymond Babbitt, although inspired by Peek, was portrayed as [autistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autistic "Autistic"). [Dustin Hoffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Hoffman "Dustin Hoffman"), who played Babbitt, met Peek and other savants to get an understanding of their nature and to play the role as accurately and [methodically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_acting "Method acting") as possible. The movie led to a number of requests for appearances, which increased Peek's self-confidence. Barry Morrow gave Peek his [Oscar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards "Academy Awards") statuette to carry with him and show at these appearances; it has since been referred to as the "Most Loved Oscar Statue"[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek#cite_note-nytimesobit-12) because it has been held by more people than any other. Peek also enjoyed approaching strangers and showing them his talent for calendar calculations by telling them on which day of the week they were born and what news items were on the front page of major newspapers. Peek also appeared on television. He travelled with his father, who took care of him and performed many motor tasks that Peek found difficult.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek#cite_note-wms-8)

Scientific investigation
------------------------

In 2004, scientists at the Center for Bioinformatics Space Life Sciences at the [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA") [Ames Research Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ames_Research_Center "Ames Research Center") examined Peek with a series of tests including [computed tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computed_tomography "Computed tomography") (CT scan) and [magnetic resonance imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging "Magnetic resonance imaging") (MRI). The intent was to create a three-dimensional view of his brain structure and to compare the images to MRI scans performed in 1988. These were the first tentative approaches in using non-invasive technology to further investigate Kim's savant abilities.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek#cite_note-13)

A 2008 study concluded that Peek probably had [FG syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FG_syndrome "FG syndrome"), a rare [X chromosome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome "X chromosome")–linked genetic syndrome that causes physical anomalies such as [hypotonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotonia "Hypotonia") (low muscle tone) and [macrocephaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrocephaly "Macrocephaly") (abnormally large head).[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek#cite_note-Opitz_JM,_Smith_JF,_Santoro_L_2008_123%E2%80%9370-5)
