> This cartridge case is designed to fit revision 1 of the [Kung Fu Flash cartridge](https://github.com/KimJorgensen/KungFuFlash) for the Commodore 64.
> 
> For the included “key caps” to fit, use tactile switches with a height of 5 mm. The right most cap shown in the photos was printed using transparent filament. This allows it to act as an optical fiber for the internal LED on the circuit board.
> 
> A 3×16 mm self-tapping screw is required to connect both halves of the case.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
