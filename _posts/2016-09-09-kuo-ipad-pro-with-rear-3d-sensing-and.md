Apple plans to release new iPad Pro models with rear 3D sensing in the first half of 2020, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

In a research note with TF International Securities, seen by MacRumors, Kuo said the iPad Pro models will gain 3D sensing through the rear-facing camera system. Apple is expected to use a time-of-flight system, which measures the time that it takes for light to bounce off of objects in a room to generate a 3D map.  
  
  
  
  
  
The timeframe lines up with a [recent report from _Bloomberg_'s Mark Gurman](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/11/new-ar-sensor-2020-ipad-pro-iphone/), who also said Apple plans to release iPad Pro models with rear 3D sensing as early as the first half of 2020. Gurman expects the iPad Pro models to feature dual rear cameras, up from a single lens, along with a new augmented reality sensor.  
  
  
  
  
  
Kuo also reiterated that Apple plans to release a so-called "iPhone SE 2" in the first half of 2020 too. He has previously said the device [will be released by the end of the first quarter](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/13/kuo-iphone-se-2-to-launch-in-q1-2020-at-399-price/) with similar features as the iPhone 8, including a 4.7-inch display and Touch ID, but with a faster A13 chip and 3GB of RAM.  
  
  
  
  
  
The low-cost iPhone will likely start around $399 with 64GB of storage, and come in Space Gray, Silver, and Red, according to Kuo.  
  
  
  
  
  
Kuo has made [both the iPad Pro](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/09/kuo-ipad-pro-3d-camera-scissor-macs-q2-2020/) and [low-cost iPhone predictions](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/13/kuo-iphone-se-2-to-launch-in-q1-2020-at-399-price/) in the past, so this really only serves as an update that the plans are still on track for early next year. Apple often holds a media event in March, and it is certainly possible the new iPad Pro and low-cost iPhone could be announced then.  
  
  
  
  
  
It is worth noting that Kuo is likely just referring to the device as the "iPhone SE 2" as an easy way to refer to Apple working on a new low-cost iPhone. With its rumored 4.7-inch display, the device would certainly not resemble the original iPhone SE in terms of size, so it could end up having a different name.
