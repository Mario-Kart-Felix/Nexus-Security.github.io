Kody K is hosting [a meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Cyber-Weapons-Lab-LA/events/267118799/) in Burbank, California on Sunday December 22nd, 2019.

> MicroPython is a slimmed-down version of Python 3 that runs on microcontrollers like the ESP8266. This simple but powerful language can control exciting hardware like individually addressable LEDs, also known as NeoPixels. In this class, Python beginners will learn to program holiday lights with unique colors and animations in MicroPython, and get to take home their final WiFi controllable holiday lights.
> 
> The first 15 registered attendees will go home with an ESP8266, breadboard, and strip of 10 individually addressable LEDs.
