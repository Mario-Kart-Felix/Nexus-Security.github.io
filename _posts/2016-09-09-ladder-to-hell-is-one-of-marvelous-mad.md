> \[Ewa Justka\] is a Glasgow, Scotland UK-based, Polish-born sound artist, musician, and inventor. She can bang her way through a raw techno set, she can blind you wish flashing lights driven by homemade circuits, or she can open a gateway to evil realms in unbridled noise – all of this at festivals like CTM, Unsound, Insomnia, and Sonic Acts. But she also builds fantastic instruments of her own – and you can buy them for your own abuse, or if you’re lucky, catch her at a workshop and make it for yourself.

> There’s the Ladder to Hell, a synthesizer. It started as a resonant ladder filter a la Moog, but devolved into something far more distorted and psychotic. There’s a WASP filter in there, too. There are SCREAM and DRIVE knobs that are … not tame. You can input CV to the Moog and Wasp filters – that’s _resonance_ on the Wasp filter, for some real punishment.
