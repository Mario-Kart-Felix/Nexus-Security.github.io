Having a laser cutter these days isn’t a big deal. But \[Chunlei Guo\], a professor at the University of Rochester, has a powerful femto-second pulse laser and used it to create what might be the [perfect solar absorber](https://phys.org/news/2020-02-lasers-etch-solar-energy-absorber.html). You can see a video about the work, below.

It stands to reason that white materials reflect most light and therefore absorb less energy than black materials — this is part of what makes a radiometer work. Tungsten, in particular, is a good metal for absorbing solar power, but this new laser treatment — which builds nanostructures on the surface of the metal — increases efficiency by 130% compared to untreated tungsten.

The team has previously used a similar technology to make metals either hydrophilic or hydrophobic. The process gives the metal a black color which is where much of the efficiency comes from. According to reports, there’s still a 15% increase using the laser-treated surface over a piece of plain black tungsten.

We’d like some of this for our [solar pool heater](https://hackaday.com/2018/07/14/iot-solar-pool-heating/). We doubt that is using tungsten to start with, so maybe that’s the first retrofit. There are plenty of non-tungsten [designs](https://hackaday.com/2014/08/07/easy-to-build-solar-pool-heater-saves-money-and-keeps-you-from-freezing/). We are more likely to find tungsten in our [light bulbs](https://hackaday.com/2018/09/26/bask-in-the-warm-glow-of-diy-incandescent-bulbs/) or our [metal-shaping tools](https://hackaday.com/2018/09/07/the-how-and-why-of-tungsten-carbide-inserts-and-a-factory-tour/).
