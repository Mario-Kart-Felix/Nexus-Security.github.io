Cats are among the most popular domesticated creatures, and their penchant for chasing laser pointers is well known. With a pair of felines of his own to look after, [\[Tobi\] set about making a device to help keep them entertained.](http://www.tobias-weis.de/cats-and-lasers/)

The aim of the device is to automate the motion of a laser pointer to make playing with the cats a hands-free operation. A pan-tilt servo mechanism has a low-power red laser pointer fitted, and the assembly is hooked up to a NodeMCU microcontroller. Based on the ESP8266, it allows the system to be controlled remotely over WiFi. Various sweeps can be automatically commanded from a smartphone, or the servo position can be controlled manually.

Test footage confirms that \[Tobi’s\] pets do indeed find the device to be worthy prey. [It’s a popular build for cat lovers](https://hackaday.com/2018/02/23/robotic-laser-keeps-cat-entertained-while-you-hack/), and readily achievable with off-the-shelf parts. If you’ve built your own hardware to keep these proud hunters out of trouble, [be sure to hit up the tip line.](http://hackaday.com/submit-a-tip)
