[Latest Dose Of Hardware Talks Headed To Supercon – Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2019/10/11/latest-dose-of-hardware-talks-headed-to-supercon/).

> The tickets have sold out even as the list of incredible speakers grows. Today we bring you the third dose of talks you’ll see at the [Hackaday Superconference](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2019-hackaday-superconference-tickets-60129236164?aff=1004com) in November — whether you were lucky enough to grab a ticket, or will be watching the livestream, these eight will be speaking on topics from algorithmically-augmented live music performance to the hardware that captures the real world for display in VR and from leveraging the power of lookup tables to harnessing our engineering talent in a way that truly enriches humanity.

AND, YAY! Scott from our team will be there!

> Supercharge Your Hardware (Old and New) with CircuitPython
> 
> CircuitPython makes programming hardware easier than ever by bringing the popular Python language to modern, inexpensive 32-bit microcontrollers. This doesn’t need to be limited to modern hardware though. By pairing a modern microcontroller running CircuitPython and a vintage computer, such as a GameBoy or Yamaha piano keyboard, you can unlock the unique characteristics of these vintage devices. In this talk, you’ll learn the basics of how CircuitPython makes coding easy, how it works under the hood, and how to extend CircuitPython with C. As an example, we’ll supercharge a Nintendo’s GameBoy with CircuitPython. By the end of the talk, you’ll be able to supercharge your own hardware project with CircuitPython.
