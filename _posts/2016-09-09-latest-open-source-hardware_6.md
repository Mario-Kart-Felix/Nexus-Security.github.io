[Latest Open-Source Hardware certifications at MAKE by Michael Weinberg](https://makezine.com/2020/02/04/open-source-hardware-certifications-for-january-2020/) –

> [The Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA)](https://www.oshwa.org/) runs a [free program](https://certification.oshwa.org/) that allows creators to certify that their hardware complies with the [community definition of open source hardware](https://www.oshwa.org/definition/).  Whenever you see the certification logo, you know that the certified hardware meets this standard.
> 
> The certification site includes a [full list](https://certification.oshwa.org/list.html) of all of the certified open source hardware.  Here is all of the hardware that was certified in January, which comes from Australia, Ecuador, India, Japan, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United States. The hardware from Ecuador and Turkey are the first pieces of certified open source hardware from those countries.

Worth noting a trend… Feather format, AND/OR supporting CircuitPython continues to be popular in industry as well as open-source hardware communities.
