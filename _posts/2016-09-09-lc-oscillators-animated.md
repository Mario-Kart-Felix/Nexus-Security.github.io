We wish that all the beautiful animations that are available today to understand math and electronics had been around when we were in school. Nonetheless, they are there for today’s students and \[Learn Engineering\] has [another gorgeous one covering LC oscillation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_y_3_3V-so). Check it out, below.

If you are thoroughly grounded — no pun intended — in LC circuits, you probably won’t learn anything new. However, the animations are worth watching, just to admire them, if nothing else.

We were amused by his statement: “… looks as if the capacitor is saying: ‘you take the energy’ and the inductor then says, ‘no, you take my energy.'” Then we were further amused by \[Seraph’s\] comment which added, “Resistance in the circuit: ‘Alright, I’ll take the energy, then.'”

Of course, there are other ways to think of an LC circuit. The math isn’t that hard. Most of us learned that the circuit’s mechanical analog is a mass on a spring or a pendulum. The mass’s potential energy stretches out the spring until the spring then pulls it back until the potential energy of the mass pulls it back down.

If you want to experiment virtually, try the [Falstad simulator](http://tinyurl.com/ufbdsz3). Just remember that if you think the sine wave isn’t dampening to look at the scale. As the sine wave dampens, the simulator will adjust the scale so you keep seeing approximately the same size sine wave.

We never get tired of watching the [Fourier series explained graphically](https://hackaday.com/2015/09/17/visualizing-the-fourier-transform/). Or anything from [\[3Blue1Brown\]](https://hackaday.com/2019/07/13/fourier-explained-3blue1brown-style/).
