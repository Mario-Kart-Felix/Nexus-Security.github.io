At first sight, [\[Kyle\]’s Elroy lamp](http://www.kylescholz.com/wp/the-elroy-lamp/) is simply an attractive piece of modern-styled interior furnishing; its clean lines, wood grain, and contemporary patterning being an asset to the room. But when he pulls out his phone, things change. Because this lamp hides a secret: at its heart may be a standard LED bulb, but the shade conceals four LCD screens driven by an Nvidia Jetson. These can be controlled through a web app to display a variety of textures, completing the effect.

This is not however simply a set of laptop screens bolted to a lampshade. The screens started life in laptops sure enough, but have since had their reflective backing removed to create a transparent LCD panel. Then an appropriate diffuser had to be found, which after much experimentation became a composite including more than one textured paper. Finally the whole was enclosed in an attractive wooden lamp frame and became part of the furniture. We like it, both as an aesthetically pleasing lamp and as a genuine departure from the norm.

This [isn’t the first eye-catching lampshade we’ve brought you](https://hackaday.com/2013/03/13/cardboard-lampshade-makes-ordinary-recycling-a-centerpiece-of-your-room/), but it’s certainly raised the bar. You can see it in action in the video below the break.
