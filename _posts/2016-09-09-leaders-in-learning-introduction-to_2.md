[Boise, Idaho local news (CBS 2)](https://idahonews.com/features/leaders-in-learning/leaders-in-learning-coding-and-programming-using-raspberry-pi) covered a middle school class teaching students on the Raspberry Pi:

> This is a capable little device, teaching these students how to code, and even program languages like HTML, CSS, and PHP.
>
