After a decade of being available exclusively to PC gamers, the cult multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, **League of Legends, is finally coming to smartphones and gaming consoles**. At the 10th anniversary celebrations of the popular franchise, Los Angeles-based video game publisher, Riot Games, announced that a new game based on the League of Legends universe will soon hit mobile devices and game consoles.  

Called **Wild Rift**, the new title will be largely similar to the classic game, but with some tweaks for the new platforms, including a new twin-stick control scheme, a new map and shorter matches that should take around 15-20 minutes each. According to Riot: _“Wild Rift is not a port of LoL on PC. It is a new game built from scratch to ensure it is a polished, legitimate LoL experience that’s worth players’ time”_. Wild Rift will hit smartphones in 2020, but there’s no ETA for the console version(s) just yet.  

  

Alongside _Wild Rift_, Riot also announced a slew of other games to be released next year. All of those, bar one, are based in the _League of Legends_ universe and, will feature the popular characters from the franchise. According to the company, the new titles will include a card game, a fighting game, multiplayer online battle arena game, open-world game and an e-sports simulator.  

The only exception to the norm is an yet-untitled game codenamed ‘Project A’ that’s said to be a tactical shooter along the lines of _Rainbow Six Siege_ or _Counter-Strike: Global Offensive_. [Talking to Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2019/10/15/riot-games-is-diversifying-its-portfolio-beyond-league-legends-into-hollywood/) about Riot’s upcoming roster, the company’s co-founder, Marc Merrill, said: _“We have the benefit of being able to be long term. We don’t have to go push out a product to meet some quarterly deadline or revenue target or whatnot”_.
