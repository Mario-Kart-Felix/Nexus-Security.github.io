**Description**  
I’ve got just the course for you!  
Hey, my name is Josh and I’ve put this course together to help people just like you quickly master HTML5…Whether you’re a beginner or a web developer with existing programming knowledge/skills!  
  
If your goal is to become a web developer, then this course is perfect for you. It’ll get you started on the right path and give you the knowledge and skills you need to start building beautiful web pages from scratch…  
  
Learning HTML is Not only for web developers but also for everyone else. Because when you have mastered HTML, you can build your own site by yourself, edit any web pages when needed (for example landing pages) versus having to get someone else to do it for you which can cost both time and money!  
In short, a good understanding of HTML is tremendously beneficial (You can’t even get around the internet these days without a basic understanding of HTML).  
Now, in this course, we’ll go far beyond that. By the end of it, you’ll have gained complete proficiency in HTML5 even if you’re currently a complete beginner!  
  
You don’t need any previous coding experience or knowledge to take this course. In fact, all you need is a desire to learn and master HTML5.  
  
This is not one of those courses that will throw too much at you at once and cause you to get overwhelmed. This is a course that you’ll not only learn so much from but also enjoy the journey as you’re learning (which is a very important part of the learning process)  
  
The course will take you by the hand and teach you everything you need to know step by step and even put your knowledge to practice immediately by working on a real-world project.  
  
We will go step by step and build a home page from scratch using HTML5. The goal here is to help you A) Learn and put into application your acquired knowledge from this course & to B) Be able to build & edit web pages with total confidence!  
**Here’s what we’ll cover in the course:**
