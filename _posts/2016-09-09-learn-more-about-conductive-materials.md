[Kobakant](http://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?p=8012) shares their list of some of their favorite conductive materials and teaches us a ton in the process. Check out this incredible resource!

> As makers, we spend much of our time with the materials of our practice. We get to know them, and they shape not only the things we are able to make, but also what we are able to imagine.
> 
> The following post is a selection of (our favorite?) conductive materials based on the following aspects:  
> \+ frequency of use (we use these materials often in our own etextile practice)
> 
> \+ origins (we have some access to information about the sources and production of these materials)
> 
> \+ accessibility (affordable and available to purchase)
> 
> \+ variety (a bit of everything)
> 
> Working in etextiles, many of our staple materials are natural and synthetic fibers, threads, yarns and fabrics made conductive through the addition of metals, carbon or conductive polymers.
