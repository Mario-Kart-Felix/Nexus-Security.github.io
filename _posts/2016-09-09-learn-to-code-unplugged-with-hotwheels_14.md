[Teaching kids code](https://teachyourkidscode.com) uses teaching simple code concepts to assist youngsters with critical thinking, creativity, and persistence!

> Today we have another great unplugged coding activity on the blog! When first getting started with learning to code, it’s best to start completely unplugged. [Screen-free coding activities](https://teachyourkidscode.com/screen-free-coding-activity/) are perfect to teach coding fundamentals. Kids as young as kindergarten can learn the [basic concepts of coding](https://teachyourkidscode.com/coding-for-kindergarten-5-basic-coding-concepts-5-year-olds-can-understand/).

> In this activity, we will be playing a grid-based coding game. Grid-based coding games are an easy way to teach kids about sequencing, algorithms and debugging. Grids are like a maze and provide kids with the challenge of giving instructions to get their ‘computer’ from start to finish.
