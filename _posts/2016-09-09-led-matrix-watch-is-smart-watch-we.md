\[Mile\] put together this stunning [LED matrix watch](https://hackaday.io/project/20840-led-matrix-watch), on which the stars of this show are the 256 monochrome 0603 LEDs arranged in a grid on its face. The matrix is only 1.4in in the diagonal and is driven by a combination of an LED driver and some shift registers. The brain is an ATmega328p. We appreciate the extra effort taken to add a USB to UART adapter so the mega can be programmed over USB. It also contains all the necessary circuitry to charge and maintain the lithium battery inside safely.

Input into the device is done with a [hall effect sensor](https://hackaday.com/2018/02/15/high-speed-imaging-of-magnetic-fields/) which keeps the build from having any moving parts. The body is a combination of 3D printed parts and really fetching brass details connecting to the band.

If it weren’t over the top enough the build even has an ambient light sensor so the display can dim or brighten depending. We bet \[Mile\] is pretty proud to wear this on their wrist.
