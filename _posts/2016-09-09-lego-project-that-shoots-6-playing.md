Like [Why Cats Paint](http://awfullibrarybooks.net/why-cats-paint/), it seemed as if [Cards as Weapons](https://archive.org/details/Cards_as_Weapons_-_Ricky_Jay_1977/mode/2up) was also a bit of a con job, all the more because it was written by con job historian and legendary trickster Ricky Jay. Nevertheless, Ricky Jay was a master of card throwing, card tricks, and tricky tricks in general. But we don’t think he’d approve of this spectacular project from the Brick Entertainment channel: a lego card shooter that can hit rates of 6 cards per second. Not even Ricky Jay could pull that off!
