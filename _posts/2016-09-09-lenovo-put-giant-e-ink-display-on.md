Lenovo is on a roll at [CES](https://beebom.com/tag/ces-2020) this year. The company has unveiled a new [5G enabled laptop](https://beebom.com/lenovo-yoga-5g-with-snapdragon-8cx-launched-ces-2020/), a [foldable Windows 10 laptop](https://beebom.com/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-foldable-announced-price-specs-features-ces-2020/), new [ThinkPad laptops](https://beebom.com/lenovo-thinkpad-thinkcenter-announced-ces-2020/), and [gaming laptops](https://beebom.com/lenovo-egpu-enclosure-unveiled-ces-2020/). That’s not all though, the company also showed off the ThinkBook Plus — a laptop that has an e-Ink display on its lid.  

Yeah, you’re reading that right. The ThinkBook Plus is a laptop that comes with a 13.3-inch FullHD IPS LCD display with thin bezels on all sides except the bottom, a pretty good looking design overall, and a giant 10.2-inch E-Ink display on the outside of the lid.  

According to Lenovo, this display is mostly meant to be used in places like meetings where you can take notes on the e-Ink display and have them save directly into OneNote. It can also show information like your calendar and events when the lid is closed so you can get a quick look at your day without having to open your laptop. The company is also envisaging a future where people will use the E-Ink display to quickly preview documents, control their Skype calls, create diagrams and more.

However, the only reason I really want to get my hands on this laptop is so I can read novels on the E-Ink screen. That’s possible, by the way, thanks to Lenovo integrating the Amazon Kindle app with the display so you can read your favourite e-books directly on your laptop’s lid.  

Lenovo says the ThinkBook Plus will be available in March 2020, and will be priced starting at $1,199.
