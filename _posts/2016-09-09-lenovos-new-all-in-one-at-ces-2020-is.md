Lenovo has launched itself into 2020 with a raft of new product unveilings at CES 2020.

The headline grabber is arguably the ThinkCentre M90a All-in-One desktop computer. Going on sale in June 2020 for an entry-level price of $1,099, there’s a 23.8-inch display, a 10th generation Intel Core processor, an AMD Radeon 625 graphics card, and up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD storage.

The screen offers 350 nits of maximum brightness. That’s less than the 500 nits found on the new ThinkPad X1 Yoga and ThinkPad X1 Carbon, but should still be plenty for most home users. If you do a lot of work in Photoshop or video editing software, however, you might find it to be a touch underwhelming.

Away from the base specs, the ThinkCentre M90a boasts an impressive number of security features. There is optional support for PrivacyGuard (which narrows the viewing angle of the screen), and you’ll also get Lenovo’s PrivacyAlert technology. PrivacyAlert will let you know if someone is looking at your screen from over your shoulder, and will automatically blur the screen when you turn away from it. A camera cover and a fingerprint scanner are also included.

During the demo, the auto-blurring screen was particularly impressive; it distorted instantly and appeared to be reliable—there was no errant blurring or failures to recognize when we had turned our head.

The PrivacyGuard was also great; there are three settings you can cycle through, each of which offers a narrower viewing angle—and thus more privacy—than the last.

If you’re a privacy fanatic, you don’t need to worry about an always-on webcam. PrivacyGuard relies on a separate IR camera to detect head movement and prying eyes.

The Lenovo rep was also keen to point out the attention to detail on the rear of the machine. The ports are all hidden under a flap, and the cables are routed through the screen’s support stand.

Other notable features include support for Wi-Fi 6, USB-A ports, a USB-C connector, a 3-in-1 card reader, an optional serial port, and a DisplayPort output.
