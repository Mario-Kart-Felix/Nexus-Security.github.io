Les Pounder (Twitter [@biglesp](https://twitter.com/biglesp)) reviews the new Serpente microcontroller board by [@arturo182](https://twitter.com/arturo182).

The tiny Serpente is very similar to the ATtiny85 based Digispark style board out a few years ago. The form factor has been upgraded to USB-C (or male USB A) and a powerful MicroChip SAMD21 microcontroller. Besides being programmable in Arduino, the Serpente can be programmed quickly and easily with [CircuitPython](https://www.circuitPython.org/).

The pinout for Serpente is almost the same as an ATTINY85 but each of the 6 GPIO pins are both analog and digital! There is also SPI and I2C as well as 2 serial ports. All of the pins are PWM too! From such a tiny board.
