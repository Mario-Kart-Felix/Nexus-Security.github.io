While the [homebrew rebreather the \[AyLo\] describes on his blog](https://aylo6061.com/2019/10/14/oxygen-rebreather-design-and-fabrication/) looks exceptionally well engineered and is documented to a level we don’t often see, he still makes it _very_ clear that he’s not suggesting you actually build one yourself. He’s very upfront about the fact that he has no formal training, and notes that he’s already identified several critical mistakes. That being said, he’s taken his rebreather out for a few dives and has (quite literally) lived to tell the tale, so he figured others might be interested in reading about his experiments.

For the landlubbers in the audience, a rebreather removes the CO2 from exhaled air and recirculates the remaining O2 for another pass through the lungs. Compared to open circuit systems, a rebreather can substantially increase the amount of time a diver can remain submerged for a given volume of gas. Rebreathers aren’t just for diving either, [the same basic concept was used in the Apollo PLSS](https://hackaday.com/2019/08/19/apollos-plss-and-the-science-of-keeping-humans-alive-in-space/) to increase the amount of time the astronauts could spend on the surface of the Moon.

The science behind it seemed simple enough, so \[AyLo\] did his research and starting designing a bare-minimum rebreather system in CAD. Rather than _completely_ hack something together with zip ties, he wanted to take the time to make sure that he could at least mate his hardware with legitimate commercial scuba components wherever possible to minimize his points of failure. It meant more time designing and machining his parts, but the higher safety factor seems well worth the effort.

[\[AyLo\] has limited the durations of his dives to ten minutes](https://aylo6061.com/2019/10/14/oxygen-rebreather-dive-notes/) or less out of caution, but so far reports no problems with the setup. As with our coverage of [the 3D printed pressure regulator](https://hackaday.com/2016/08/23/diy-pressure-regulator-for-exciting-scuba/) or [the Arduino nitrox analyser](https://hackaday.com/2018/11/03/arduino-nitrox-analyzer-for-the-submarine-hacker/), we acknowledge there’s a higher than usual danger factor in these projects. But with a scientific approach and more conventional gear reserved for backups, these projects prove that hardware hacking is possible in even the most inhospitable conditions.
