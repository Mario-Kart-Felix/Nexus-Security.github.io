> Many things were different in 1999 – Clinton had just been impeached, people were terrified of the Y2K bug and _Windows 98_ was the operating system most PC users had to struggle with. To be fair _Windows 98_ wasn’t _that_ bad, but there was one thing that was a constant source of annoyance – Clippy the “helpful” talking paperclip, who would pop up and give you advice while you were using _Microsoft Word_. _LetterWriter ’99_ takes you back to that time, and tasks you with writing a letter to your prospective new boss, with Clippy “helping” you along the way!
> 
> It’s a great little game with some very witty writing and you get a nice touch of nostalgia when that classic desktop boots up. As you repeatedly fail to write your letter _LetterWriter ’99_takes some very funny, weird and dark turns and Clippy is a constant source of amusement. Even once you think you’re finished, it’s worth trying again as Clippy has plenty of surprises up his sleeve. Highly recommended.
