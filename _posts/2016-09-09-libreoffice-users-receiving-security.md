Users of the open-source office productivity software LibreOffice have reported keeping running into numerous security warnings when installing the app on the newly released macOS 10.15 Catalina.  
  
It was during the public beta for macOS Catalina that some LibreOffice users observed that Apple's GateKeeper warnings were competent enough to scare off many users.  
  
Despite the fact that Apple had cautioned macOS designers in June that all Mac applications that are marked with a Developer ID would likewise be 'notarized' by Apple and furthermore guaranteed this would empower a "more streamlined Gatekeeper interface" when users download macOS applications from the web.  
  
While LibreOffice version 6.2 was not authorized, the most recent 6.3 version evidently has been. Be that as it may, as per LibreOffice, users are as yet getting the GateKeeper alert with the extra notice that "macOS cannot verify that is app is free from malware”.  
  
"Although we have duly followed the instructions when users launch LibreOffice 6.3.x – which has been notarized by Apple – the system shows the following scary message: 'LibreOffice.the app cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified', and provides only two options: Move to Bin (delete) and Cancel (revert the operation, i.e., do not run LibreOffice)," writes LibreOffice's Italo Vignoli.  
  
LibreOffice anyway suggested a couple of ways through which the users can without much of a stretch 'bypass' the message. With respect to Apple's notarization, app developer Jeff Johnson has clarified that the key security benefit originates from the necessity that developers utilize their Apple ID and password for their developer account to submit the application to Apple for legal approbation.  
  
Along these lines, the attacker would need to 'compromise' both a signing certificate and the developer's Apple ID in order to distribute the malware.
