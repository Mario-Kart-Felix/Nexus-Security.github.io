We’re not entirely sure where the lightbulb-idea concept came from, but it’s a cultural touchstone rapidly becoming outmoded by the prevalence of compact fluorescent and LED lighting. Despite this, [\[Alex Glow\] and \[Moheeb Zara\] whipped up the Prometheus Lamp to let you experience it for real.](https://www.hackster.io/glowascii/prometheus-lamp-ab93f3)

The build starts with a glass lightbulb souvenir from the Neon Museum in Las Vegas. Inside, a TinyLily Mini microcontroller board is tasked with talking to an accelerometer to detect movement. When the lightbulb is picked up and oriented in the vertical axis, it lights up a NeoPixel LED, glowing to indicate that you’ve just had a remarkable idea! It’s all powered off a single CR2032 coin cell, thanks to the low voltage requirements of the modern TinyLily components.

It’s a build that serves as a good way to learn about accelerometers, and it makes a fun desk toy, too. We’ve seen some other projects go by the name “Prometheus”, too — [like a wrist mounted flame thrower](https://hackaday.com/2009/11/03/improved-arm-mounted-flame-thrower/). How’s that for variety?
