In the ever-popular world of _Harry Potter_, a pair of Spectrespecs are useful if you’re hunting for wrackspurts and nargles. While we’ve never spotted either of these creatures ourselves, if you’d like to go out on a hunt, [\[Laveréna\]’s build might be for you.](https://www.hackster.io/kburns/tinylily-halloween-harry-potter-luna-lovegood-spectrespecs-a7dbb1)

To start with, you’ll need the frames for the Spectrespecs. \[Laveréna\] elected to source hers commercially, but you can [3D print them](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2960327) or even [craft them by hand if you so desire](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/how-to-spectrespecs-diy-printable-luna-lovegood-glasses-1106526). Then, a TinyLily microcontroller board is installed, with its small size allowing it to be tucked neatly out of sight in the top of the sunglasses. Two NeoPixels are then installed, with the TinyLily programmed to flash the LEDs in the requisite blue and red colors for easy identification of supernatural creatures.

Tools such as cheap microcontrollers designed for wearables and low-cost addressable LEDs are making advanced cosplay designs easier than ever. Whipping up custom blinkables no longer requires knowledge of advanced multiplexing techniques and how to properly drive high-power LEDs. Of course, LED wearables do still get properly advanced – [like this skin-based 7-segment display](https://hackaday.com/2016/04/19/super-thin-display-makes-your-skin-your-screen/). If you’ve got a glowable project of your own that you’re dying to share, [be sure to let us know!](http://hackaday.com/submit-a-tip)
