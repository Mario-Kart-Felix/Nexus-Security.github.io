> Arizona-based storm chaser and videographer [Dustin Farrell](http://dfvc.com/) just released “Transient 2”, the [sequel to his 2017 film](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2017/12/transient-lighting-film-dustin-farrell/). For roughly three and a half minutes, the skies open up to reveal flashes of lightning and billowing clouds rolling across open plains. Farrell shares that he traveled 35,000 miles over two years to shoot the raw footage, and spent about 300 hours editing. To capture the brief but powerful flashes of lightning, Farrell relied on his Phantom Flex 4K, shooting at very high speeds. The short film’s music is by [Harry Lightfoot](http://www.harrylightfoot.com/). You can tag along with Farrell’s travels from the safety of your couch via [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dustin_farrell/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2sz4UUggmeUutsvzJWx7ww).
