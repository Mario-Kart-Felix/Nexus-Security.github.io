How to Improve Your Internal Linking Strategy With Link Whisper (3 Key Methods)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Link Whisper includes multiple features you can use to significantly improve your internal linking strategy. By taking all your content into consideration – not just the post you’re currently editing – it provides as many opportunities as possible for finding and adding new connections. Here’s how.

### 1\. Add Internal Links from the WordPress Editor

First, Link Whisper helps you create outbound internal links for new posts you’re writing. In the WordPress editor, simply scroll down to find the _Link Whisper Suggested Links_ section:

![Adding outbound internal links in the WordPress editor using Link Whisper suggestions.](https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/inbound-internal-link.png)

Here, you’ll see a list of potential outbound links related to the content you’re currently working on. In the lefthand column, you’ll see a sentence from the WordPress editor with the plugin’s suggested anchor text applied. You can simply click on any word to add or remove it from the link.

In the righthand column, you’ll see the title and slug for the post the plugin is suggesting you link to. To add the link, simply select the checkbox to the left of the suggestion, then click on the _Update Links_ button. There’s no need for copying and pasting URLs or switching back and forth between tabs to search for potential link sources.

### 2\. Manage Your Links from the Internal Links Report

In addition to the suggestions it provides in the editor, Link Whisper also gives you a big-picture view of your site’s links. Once you have the plugin installed, you can navigate to _Link Whisper > Report_:

![The Link Whisper Internal Links Report.](https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/internal-links-report.png)

Here, each post and page on your site is listed along with information regarding three types of links:

*   **Inbound internal links:** Links within other posts on your site that are pointing towards this one.
*   **Outbound internal links:** Links in this post that are pointing towards other content on your site.
*   **Outbound external links:** Links within this post that are pointing towards content on other sites.

You can click on the plus (+) sign next to any number listed in the report to see the URLs of each link in that particular cell. The information you can find here is useful for seeking out content that is lacking in links. The table is sortable and searchable, making it easy to quickly pinpoint posts with no inbound or outbound internal links.

Once you’ve located such as post, you can open in it the editor to incorporate outbound internal links using Link Whisper’s suggestions. Alternatively, you can take advantage of the plugin’s other link building method to create internal inbound links.

### 3\. Incorporate Inbound Internal Links into Old Posts

Linking to older posts on your WordPress site can help renew interest in them, as visitors will have more opportunities to find them via your other content. However, it’s unlikely you’ll be able to recall posts you published months or even years ago and know offhand what other pieces might relate to them.

Link Whisper can help with this by suggesting inbound internal links for any post on your site. In the Internal Links Report, simply click on the _Add_ button under _Inbound internal links_:

![The outbound internal links add button in the Internal Links Report.](https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/add-links.png)

This will take you to the Inbound Links Suggestions list. It will show you sentences from posts and pages throughout your site that may be relevant to the content you’re currently viewing suggestions for:

![Link Whisper outbound internal links suggestions.](https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/outbound-internal-link.png)

You can edit the proposed anchor text just as you would for outbound internal links suggestions in the editor. The other two columns here will list the post or page on which the link will appear, and the date on which that post was published.

To add the suggested links, simply select the checkbox to the left and click on the _Add links_ button. They’ll be incorporated without you having to open each post, saving you hours of editing and updating.
