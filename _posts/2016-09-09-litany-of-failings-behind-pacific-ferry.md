By Hans Lee SYDNEY (Reuters) - An overloaded ferry that sank near the Pacific island archipelago of Kiribati last year, killing 95 people, was not allowed to carry passengers in the open sea, and had twice run aground before its fateful journey, an inquiry has found. Only five passengers and two crew members of 102 aboard survived the sinking of the MV Butiraoi ferry in January 2018, after many died of thirst and hunger while adrift for over a week in a lifeboat in the central Pacific Ocean. The report commissioned by the government detailed a litany of failings that caused the tragedy, including the ferry's departure without notifying authorities.
