Designed to help data processing using `clojure.spec`.

Provide users the ability to combine several pre-defined `clojure.spec` into some specific shape at _runtime_.

For now, it only supports JSON files. This library is in alpha-stage, still needs many test cases and refactors, although the Public API **must** not change.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Leiningen/Boot

Clojure CLI/deps.edn

```
meta-schema {:mvn/version "0.1.4"}
```

[](https://github.com/wandersoncferreira/meta-schema#usage)Usage
----------------------------------------------------------------

In your project you need to define EDN files inside a folder and provide a list of `java.io.File`s to the `(setup! ..)` function. These files are simple and provides the location and intent of your pre-defined specs.

```
{:zipcode {:intent "Validation to ZipCodes in Brazil" :location :my-project.spec/zipcode-br} :money {:intent "How we understand money around here? Anything >= 0 either long, float, double, or decimal" :location :my-project.other-spec/money-br} }
```

Make sure that all this namespaces are loaded before invoke `meta-schema.core/setup!`.

Example of specification provided to the library at runtime.

```
 (require '\[meta-schema.core :as ms\]) (require '\[clojure.alpha.spec :as s\]) (require '\[clojure.java.io :as io\]) (ms/setup! (\-> (io/resources "specs") (io/file) (file-seq))) (def file-spec {:spec-name :my-project.client/payload :zip \[{:spec :zipcode :optional? false :nullable? false} {:house-price {:spec :money :nullable? true}}\] :rent {:spec :money :optional? false :nullable? false} :university {:departments \[{:zip {:address {:spec :zipcode :optional? false}}}\]}}) (def my-parser (ms/create-parser file-spec)) (def my-data-1 {:zip \["my zipcode is text"\] :rent 10 :university {:departments \[{:zip {:address "deep structures"}}\]}}) (s/valid? my-parser my-data-1) ;; => true (s/valid? my-parser {:zip \[{:house-price 230} "either or both here.."\] :rent 10 :university {:departments \[{:zip {:address "deep structures"}}\]}}) ;; => true 
```

Cool, now we can finally finish the example above. Let's say your source code only understands a specific `target-fmt` of MAP that can be processed. For sure, your clients does not want to send you that format, right? Because they can't change legacy systems and make something better to help everybody. That's ok!

```
 (def client-data {:zip \["101030-201", "987621-281"\] :rent 980.322 :university {:departments \[{:zip {:address "University at Medium Inc.,"}}\]}}) (def client-spec {:spec-name :my-project.client/payload :zip \[{:spec :zipcode :destination :zipcode}\] :rent {:spec :money :destination :value} :university {:departments \[{:zip {:address {:spec :zipcode :destination :university-address}}}\]}}) (def target-fmt {:my-internal-zipcode :zipcode :my-internal-value :value :my-internal-address :university-address}) (setup! (\-> (io/resource "specs") (io/file) (file-seq))) (input-data->target-data client-data client-spec target-fmt) ;; => {:my-internal-zipcode \["101030-201" "987621-281"\], ;; :my-internal-value 980.322, ;; :my-internal-address "University at Medium Inc.,"}
```

The clojure.spec to validate the data is created at runtime and applied to the provided data. If it passes, we start the transformation to the `target-shape` specified.

[](https://github.com/wandersoncferreira/meta-schema#rationale)Rationale
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The DSL is simple:

1.  When the field is a list, more than one spec inside it will produce a `or` operator
2.  When the field is `optional`, it means that may or may not be present at coersion time
3.  When the field is `nullable`, it means that `nil` is a valid input.
4.  By default all the fields are _not_ nullable and _not_ optionals.
5.  You can nest the options as you desired
