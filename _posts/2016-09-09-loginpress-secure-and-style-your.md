Why It’s Beneficial to Apply Custom Branding to Your Login Page
---------------------------------------------------------------

While custom branding sounds like a cool feature, you may not see it as vital to your website’s success. On the contrary, [consistency in design](https://www.clearvoice.com/blog/brand-consistency-why-its-so-important-how-to-achieve-it/), messaging, and tone across your online presence is important for establishing your company’s identity.

A solid brand identity makes it easier to build awareness of your business and to amass a loyal following. Plus, a custom Login Page just looks more professional than the WordPress default:

Additionally, users who are logging into your site for the first time may be confused by the WordPress Login Page. If there’s nothing to reassure them they’re in the right place, your visitors may leave before ever typing in their usernames.

With a custom Login Page, you don’t have to worry about users feeling lost. You can also incorporate a Login Widget in your sidebar so it’s easy to find, and improve User Experience (UX) and workflow by setting up [Login Redirects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=F-kxP8eCQzU&feature=emb_logo).

How to Secure Your WordPress Site With LoginPress (4 Methods)
-------------------------------------------------------------

Login Page security is even more important than custom branding. An attack could result in stolen data, the destruction or your site, and the loss of your users’ trust. LoginPress Pro provides several features that can help in this regard, as we’ve explored below.

### 1\. Enable Auto Login for Key Users

‘Auto Login’ refers to a process by which you can enable certain users to gain entry to your site without a password. Instead, you’ll assign them a specific URL they’ll use to ‘log in’:

![The LoginPress Auto-Login feature.](https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/loginpress-auto-login.png)

Malicious hacking strategies such as brute force attacks require the use of a username and password combination. By minimizing the number of passwords associated with your site, LoginPress can make it more difficult for this type of attack to be carried out.

### 2\. Allow Users to Log In Via Their Preferred Social Media Platforms

Another alternative login method is ‘Social Login’, which enables users to connect their social media profiles to their accounts on your website. Instead of using traditional credentials, they’ll confirm their identities via the other platforms you’ve specified:

![The LoginPress Social Login settings.](https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/loginpress-social-login.png)

The _Help_ tab in LoginPress’ Social Login settings provides details on how to connect your site to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google. This feature is especially useful for preventing spam and bot registrations on your site.

### 3\. Hide the Default WordPress Login Page

WordPress automatically sets your website’s Login Page URL as _https://ift.tt/1kcOjQ2_. This makes it particularly easy for hackers to find the Login Pages of sites built on the platform and launch attacks against it.

LoginPress’ Hide/Rename feature enables you to change the URL to anything you like, making it harder for malicious browsers to find:

![The LoginPress Hide/Rename Login Page feature.](https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/loginpress-hide-login.png)

Just remember, you don’t want to change the address to anything you’re likely to forget, or you could end up without a way back to your dashboard.

### 4\. Limit Login Attempts to Deter Hackers

Brute force attacks require rapid and repetitive login attempts. There are several WordPress plugins that are designed to recognize this behavior as suspicious and block it, including LoginPress.

If a user (or bot) enters the same credentials multiple times in quick succession unsuccessfully, LoginPress will prevent them from entering your site for a pre-determined amount of time:

![Specifying the login attempt limit and lockout time in LoginPress.](https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/loginpress-limit-attempts.png)

You can specify the number of allowed attempts, as well as how long users will have to wait between failed logins before trying again.

Conclusion
----------

WordPress’ default Login Page provides a decent baseline. However, without your branding or advanced security measures in place, it could be confusing to your users and vulnerable to attacks.

[LoginPress Pro](http://social.appsumo.com/g7oqx6) offers an extensive list of Login Page customizations, in addition to several methods for preventing brute force attacks, such as:

1.  Enabling Auto Login for key users.
2.  Allowing users to log in via their preferred social media platforms.
3.  Hiding the default WordPress Login Page.
4.  Limiting login attempts to deter hackers.
