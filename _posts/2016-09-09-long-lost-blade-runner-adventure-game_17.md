> The classic 1997 _Blade Runner_ adventure game, which was once nearly impossible to find and play, has been [rereleased on GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/blade_runner). _Blade Runner_ (the game) told a unique detective story set parallel to the original 1982 film. It includes some existing characters voiced by _Blade Runner_ actors Sean Young and James Hong, but it features a new character named Ray McCoy — a Los Angeles Police Department blade runner who has to search crime scenes and hunt down rogue replicants.
> 
> _Blade Runner_ won praise for capturing the original game’s cinematic atmosphere. Development studio Westwood — the now-defunct creator of the _Command & Conquer_series — also created a complex branching narrative that randomized whether certain characters were humans or replicants, changing the game with each playthrough.
