On a yearly basis, Retromark also becomes a conference where topical issues and developments are discussed.

  

The IPKat is glad to say that Retromark is returning for its third year with another afternoon of trade mark law and practice on **Tuesday, 24 March 2020**. We will be again joining forces with Darren and a range of speakers to probe at some of the most important issues in trade marks today.
