Crafts have become a big part of the day to day lives of many people who want to have real skills in this world. The work of Carol Milne turns the use value of craft skills on their head by bringing together glasswork and classic knit patterns in her beautiful fine art.

> [Carol Milne](https://www.carolmilne.com/)’s knit pieces might resemble your grandmother’s afghans but certainly aren’t as soft or pliable. The Seattle-based artist ([previously](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/?s=carol+milne)) utilizes kiln cast lead crystal to create her loose weaves of translucent, color-coordinated glass. They often flow down from the hands and knitting needles they’re fashioned on, giving the feeling that the works could expand with just a few more stitches.

> “I see my knitted work as metaphor for social structure. Individual strands are weak and brittle on their own, but deceptively strong when bound together,” Milne writes in [a statement](https://www.carolmilne.com/bio). “You can crack or break single threads without the whole structure falling apart. And even when the structure is broken, pieces remain bound together. The connections are what bring strength and integrity to the whole and what keep it intact.” Some of the artist’s knitted glass pieces will be on view from March 6 to May 1 at [Blue Spiral 1](http://www.bluespiral1.com/Exhibit_Detail.cfm?ShowsID=269) in Asheville, North Carolina. Until then, head to [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/carolmilneart/) to see more of her delicate pieces.
