> We needed an inexpensive and compact plate shaker for our anaerobic chamber. The Crickit Lab Shaker, remixed by DotScott1, was the perfect inspiration!
> 
> I modified the original Crickit project to use the same inexpensive electronics as DotScott1â€™s remix, but with a few modifications to fit our needs. The case is changed from three parts to two, with the entire upper part of the case a single print, and with all of the electronics mounted to the top. The bottom case panel now includes places to press-fit neodymium magnets to help prevent the shaker from moving around, and can be screwed firmly into the top case with countersunk machine screws. Thereâ€™s now also a nifty printed â€˜volumeâ€™ indicator for the PWM potentiometer. ![ðŸ™‚](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png)

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And donâ€™t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
