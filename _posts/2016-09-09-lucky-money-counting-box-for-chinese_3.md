> Hello everyone! This week is a special fesitival for Chinese – the lunar new year. In China, you’ll hear it being called chunjie (春节), or the Spring Festival. The spring festival is the biggest festival of the year, and the celebration lasts for almost 40 days.
> 
> In other cultures, people receive gifts for holidays. In China, we receive Hongbao (红包）in the spring festival. Hongbao is also called red packets or red envelopes, and people will put the lucky money in. This lucky money is supposed to help transfer fortune from the elders to the kids. They can also be given between bosses and employees, co-workers, and friends.
> 
> Normally it is not very important that how many money we could get from. We treasure the good wish and tradition, so to receive Hongbao and lucky money is always one of the most exciting thing for us in new year. Not suprisingly, many kids could receive as much as hundreds of Hongbao after a spring festival!
