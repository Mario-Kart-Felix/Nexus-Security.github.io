Ludovic Courtès (Guix) accusing Stallman of Thoughtcrime
========================================================

[Ludovic Courtès](http://people.bordeaux.inria.fr/lcourtes/) ([Guix](https://guix.gnu.org)) is accusing Stallman of [Thoughtcrime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughtcrime). By using the same platform that was provided to him by chief gnuissance Dr. [Richard Stallman](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html), the subdomain [guix.gnu.org](https://guix.gnu.org) on [gnu.org](https://www.gnu.org) domain, Ludovic Courtès is defaming and harassing Stallman for reasons of thoughtcrime ([see the book 1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughtcrime)).

By that same act Ludovic Courtès abuses the [Guix code of conduct](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/tree/CODE-OF-CONDUCT) and the [GNU Kind Communication Guidelines](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/kind-communication.html) as set in the community by Richard Stallman himself.

Hatred, animosity and separation are products of Ludovic Courtès in October 2019. His disgraceful statement was published on [https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2019/joint-statement-on-the-gnu-project/](https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2019/joint-statement-on-the-gnu-project/) whereby no prior Guix discussion have taken place. How did those people get together to publish such statement? There are no references that I could find on the [Guix](https://guix.gnu.org) mailing lists.

It is in contradiction to GNU Kind Communication Guidelines: [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/kind-communication.html](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/kind-communication.html) where by it says: "The only political positions that the GNU Project endorses are (1) that users should have control of their own computing (for instance, through free software) and (2) supporting basic human rights in computing."

My domain [gnu.support](https://gnu.support) is not connected or sponsored by FSF, neither it is part of [GNU project](https://www.gnu.org). It is there to publish my opinions or maybe opinions of other people, I am welcoming opinions on every page of this domain.

I have asked Ludovic Courtès to state the facts that will prove and evidence their statement "that Stallman’s behavior over the years has undermined a core value of the GNU project: the empowerment of all computer users. GNU is not fulfilling its mission when the behavior of its leader alienates a large part of those we want to reach out to." -- as such statement is baseless, fact-less, pure generalization and rumour.

References to his answers can be found on [2019-10-07](http://logs.guix.gnu.org/guix) IRC log and [2019-10-08](http://logs.guix.gnu.org/guix) IRC log. This same log is not accessible as of 2019-10-09 (504 Gateway Time-out). This page will be updated.

Yet, Ludovic Courtès, is asking people to join him in such nonsense on the GNU.ORG domain, and he does not give people an option to comment on that page.

I have asked Ludovic Courtès to enable comments on his political blog that he publishes on Guix operating system, yet he justified himself that they have no option to enable comments on that blog. Pardon me. Hacker of the operating system that has no option to enable comments?!

The disgraceful statement gives impression that all GNU maintainers including the GNU project is against RMS, which is absolutely not true.

So Ludovic Courtès could not answer "which behavior over the years undermined a core value of GNU project to empower all computer users".

Ludovic Courtès could not provide any fact supporting his general statement.

He mentioned abort() joke, and Emacs virgins. One big X$%\*&#X LOL!

Thus RMS is made guilty of [thoughtcrime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughtcrime), harassed, and defamed on his own website GNU.org on the subdomain guix.gnu.org by his own project maintainer.

Yes, it is true that GNU.org domain belongs to FSF and FSF is organization, but those are legal matters. Legal entity is legal entity in the legal world. In the world of people, both the foundation FSF and GNU.org are creations of Dr. Richard Stallman, and are thus HIS OWN. It does not matter how he has organized the system of people and made legal entities to protect his creations. This does not matter. The domain is his own and it probably existed before the FSF was founded.

To publish his political opinions where Ludovic Courtès is defaming and harassing Richard Stallman on his own domain is disgraceful and shameful activity!

That would be like me to kick my own mother in her stomach.

**Do I bash Guix and Ludovic Courtès for their free speech? NO!**

**Not at all.**

I do not mind what they are speaking and what is somebody speaking or thinking bad about RMS, me, or anybody else. Everybody is entitled to their opinion.

But what I find really embarassing and disgraceful and immature act that Ludovic Courtès is publishing such defamation on RMS on RMS's GNU.ORG domain!

What I find embarassing, and not appropriate is that Ludovic Courtès, Ricardo Wurmus, Matt Lee, Andreas Enge, Samuel Thibault, Carlos O'Donell, Andy Wingo, Jordi Gutiérrez Hermoso, Mark Wielaard, Ian Lance Taylor, Werner Koch, Daiki Ueno, Christopher Lemmer Webber, Jan Nieuwenhuizen, John Wiegley, Tom Tromey, Jeff Law, Han-Wen Nienhuys, Joshua Gay, Ian Jackson, Tobias Geerinckx-Rice, Andrej Shadura, Zack Weinberg and John W. Eaton are participating in defamation of character of Richard Stallman on his own domain GNU.ORG.

They are participating in rumour based ruination of his character.

**And I cannot find any trace if they ever asked RMS what is actually going on**. As of 2019-10-09 they have not shown adult logic to verify what is going on, they simply participate in rumours and create hatred, animosity and enmity.

It is not the RMS. Those people are now using GNU website to undermine the GNU project. They are doing more harm than good.

Defamation is illegal in many countries, which is especially illegal in France where Ludovic Courtès has his residency.

Ludovic Courtès is judge, attorney, and witness in the same time and he decides who is the jury and does not allow any public opinion. He invites and accepts the jury by his own.

He is abusing the kind and social behavior of Richard Stallman who is giving him the GNU.ORG subdomain to publish defamation against Richard Stallman.

He is harming RMS and harming the GNU project by providing such ridiculous baseless statements.

Ludovic Courtès and other people who joined in that statement are harming the Guix project too as they are making it political.

People are already resigning from support of Guix project. Is that the result that Ludovic Courtès wish to get?

Don't they understand that their own trust-worth is undermined by undersigning the fact-less statements, by accusing Stallman of [thoughtcrime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughtcrime)?!

I understand Ludovic Courtès as I understand he has personal pressure due to his relation to GNU project. I could only think that somebody mentioned to him about rumours on RMS and so Ludovic Courtès feels not conveniet to be in the GNU project, so he made his decision to disassociate himself from RMS. This is my impression and from that viewpoint I can understand himself and others. But that is not mature decision. It is decision based on [thoughtcrime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughtcrime), fact-less judgment, against any human rights of free speech.

Stallman is entitled to free speech!

Humanitarian who always strived to teach other people of free speech is now accused for his own free speech!

Dr. Richard Stallman is not a criminal. Do not make him such on his own domain!

Publish your ridiculous statemtns on GUIX domain or some others, I could not care less.

What I hate is their hypocrisy, hypocrisy is that they accuse RMS of underminind GNU project, which has no foundation at all, while they are undermining their own GNU projects in the same time.

They are accusing RMS of what they are doing themselves.

Ludovic Courtès lacks the integrity and logical sense to distinguish between the GNU project and the fact that RMS is entitled to his opinions and that rumour that can happen to anybody in this world is rumour and not a fact, and shall not be used as fake evidence to make RMS guilty of [thoughtcrime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughtcrime).

RMS did nothing wrong that could justify the statement justifies the Guix and Ludovic Courtès's statement "that RMS's behavior over the years undermined a core value of GNU project to empower all computer users".

He is publishing his articles and has his opinions on [www.stallman.org](https://www.stallman.org) website. Many of his opinions may be opposing to other people's opinions, so what? RMS is always kind and sticks to his integrity and policies.

His political opinions are separate and not published on GNU.ORG or FSF.ORG websites, contrary to what Ludovic Courtès is doing.

FSF or GNU.ORG maintainers NEED TO HAVE one responsible person who is to enforce the policies.

If only this policy below would be enforced, it would be fine for GNU.ORG and GNU software projects:

[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/kind-communication.html](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/kind-communication.html) where by it says: "The only political positions that the GNU Project endorses are (1) that users should have control of their own computing (for instance, through free software) and (2) supporting basic human rights in computing."

I would enforce that policy for GNU software and projects on GNU.ORG, but I cannot. I can only ask FSF and GNU and GNU supporters to enforce that.

Nobody shall be bashed for their opinions! While I am opposing their baseless opinion, I consider they are fully entitled to their opinion.

But using the GNU.ORG website to defame, harass and disturb RMS is out of this world!

Let Ludovic Courtès express his opinion on his own domain. Let him be whoever he is. I do not know who is he, as I would never do that to person like RMS who did good for mankind. I do not know that type of character.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hereby, I the undersigner, who have contacted the [gnu.support](https://gnu.support) website, think that such political opinions of Ludovic Courtès should not have place on GNU.ORG website neither on Guix or free software websites, and that he, Ludovic Courtès shall stick to[https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/tree/CODE-OF-CONDUCT](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/tree/CODE-OF-CONDUCT) Guix Code of Conduct and to principles that "The only political positions that the GNU Project endorses are (1) that users should have control of their own computing (for instance, through free software) and (2) supporting basic human rights in computing."

Additionally, I am recognizing that Dr. Richard Stallman is accused of [thoughtcrime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughtcrime) and is being defamed and harassed for reasons of thoughtcrime.

Please contact me, and tell me your opinion, I will publish it here how it is.
