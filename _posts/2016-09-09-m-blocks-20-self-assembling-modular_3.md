Version 2 of these self building blocks brings communication and identification. Via [MIT News](http://news.mit.edu/2019/self-transforming-robot-blocks-jump-spin-flip-identify-each-other-1030):

> Swarms of simple, interacting robots have the potential to unlock stealthy abilities for accomplishing complex tasks. Getting these robots to achieve a true hive-like mind of coordination, though, has proved to be a hurdle.
> 
> In an effort to change this, a team from MITâ€™s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) came up with a surprisingly simple scheme: self-assembling robotic cubes that can climb over and around one another, leap through the air, and roll across the ground.
