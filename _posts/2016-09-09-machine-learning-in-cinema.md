Impressive special effects are a hallmark of contemporary blockbusters. This year’s Visual Effects nominees at the Oscars were no exception.

In case you missed it, here are this year’s nominees for Best Visual Effects: [Avengers: Endgame](https://www.marvel.com/movies/avengers-endgame), [The Lion King](https://movies.disney.com/the-lion-king-2019), [Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker](https://www.starwars.com/films/star-wars-episode-ix-the-rise-of-skywalker), [The Irishman](https://www.netflix.com/title/80175798), and [1917](https://www.1917.movie/).

[Although we already know the outcome](https://oscar.go.com/news/winners/1917-is-the-2020-oscar-winner-for-visual-effects), there are still a few surprises to be revealed about these amazing films. Specifically, the techniques that bring these movies to life! Kevin Baillie goes over some of the hottest visual effects techniques in the video “[VFX Artist Breaks Down the Best Visual Effects Oscars Nominees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN5LYwrVMW0)“. Baillie walks through the advanced CGI, VR, and machine learning techniques that make some of your favorite characters come to life. Of note, Avengers: Endgame supervillain Thanos and the Hulk get a lot of their facial expressions from AI. This is extremely important because that structure gives the character’s depth and emotion that is realistic and relatable. A lot of the amazing work to augment these characters was done by [Digital Domain’s](https://www.digitaldomain.com/) [Masquerade](https://www.goodworklabs.com/machine-learning-avengers-endgame/) AI.
