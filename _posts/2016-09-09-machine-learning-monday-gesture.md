Machine learning Monday! Gestures and more! ([video](https://youtu.be/MG6rgUuA_o4)). The EdgeBadge and Circuit Playground Bluefruit have a built in 3-axis accelerometer, so they’re ready to try out the TensorFlow lite demos for recognizing gestures. The default tflite file has three gestures it can recognize: WING (W), RING (O) and SLOPE (L). We light up the LEDs as well as show the detected gesture on an attached display Check out the code here to [try it yourself](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_TFLite)!
