In our [previous](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/09/04/new-guide-running-tensorflow-lite-object-recognition-on-the-raspberry-pi-4-adafruit-adafruitlearningsystem-adafruitio-tensorflow-raspberry_pi-adafruit-makermelissa/) [demos](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/09/09/machine-learning-monday-mobilenet-v4-ssd-lite-on-raspberry-pi-4-adafruit-raspberry_pi-tensorflow-machinelearning-tinyml-raspberrypi/), we got Google’s Object Detection models running on a Raspberry Pi so that you could build your own smart camera! There’s just one thing–what if you want to recognize something else besides coffee cups and people? Until recently, this was challenging; either it required a complex Colaboratory notebook or a long series of local commands to set up a local TensorFlow environment.

Google recently released a tool called [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) that automates the whole process for you! You bring some example images, configure a few parameters on their web page, and voila! Google produces a custom model trained against your own objects.

This guide walks you through the process of configuring Teachable Machine, downloading the generated model to Raspberry Pi 4, and running the model on your Pi.
