[TensorFlow in your browser: Object Detection with Bounding Boxes](https://learn.adafruit.com/tensorflow-in-your-browser-object-detection-with-bounding-boxes?view=all) – Watch TensorFlow identify and box everyday objects using your phone or computer’s camera…

> You’ve heard about Machine Learning and AI – and you want to see what all the fuss is about. But you don’t want to spend all your time installing bazel and Jupyter? Or maybe you’re running an old computer or your only computer is a phone! What now, give up? Never! Thanks to Google Colab, you can run TensorFlow in a browser window, and all the computation is handled on Google’s cloud service for free. It’s a great way to dabble, without all the setup!
> 
> We’ve hacked together a Colab notebook that can see things using your computer, laptop, or phone camera! It takes live pictures from your camera and feeds them through the Mobilenet v2 + SSDLite model to find and box the objects it sees. This way you can see what Mobilenet v2 + SSDLite can do, instantly!
