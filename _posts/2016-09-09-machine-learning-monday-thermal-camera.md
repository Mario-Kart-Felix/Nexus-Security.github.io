Want to be like the Predator and have thermal vision? Well, maybe not with the 2 hour dental cleanings ([video](https://youtu.be/LDppCCAsYq0)). So, instead, DIY thermal vision with this MLX90640 thermal camera with STEMMA QT connector so it plugs right into the BrainCraft HAT. We’re displaying the heatmap output right on the 1.54” TFT. We think this could be useful for training ML/AI models that are looking for ‘heat signatures’… maybe could differentiate between Xenomorphs, Humans, and adorable kittens!
