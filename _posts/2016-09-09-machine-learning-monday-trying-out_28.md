Machine Learning Monday – Trying out the TensorFlow Lite ‘hello world’ with Arcada ([video](https://youtu.be/59rfuaKEu1M)). We like to visualize our ML output, so when we loaded up the new Arduino TensorFlow library, we wanted to try adding a screen. Here we take an X coordinate, pass it through TensorFlow model that has learned what a sine wave is, and get a Y coordinate back. Here we are plotting the X & Y on the display as a red ball. We had to slow it down a bit so it was visible!
