This brings Apple Arcade game subscription, all-new Mac versions of Apple Music, Apple Podcasts and Apple TV apps, Sidecar feature that extends Mac desktops with iPad as a second display, or tablet input device using Apple Pencil with Mac apps, Voice Control that allows Mac to be controlled entirely by voice, Mac Catalyst, a new technology that makes it easy for third-party developers to bring iPad apps to Mac, Screen Time that gives users insight into how they spend time in apps and on websites, and the ability to decide how to spend their time. macOS Catalina 10.15 update is 4.9GB in size, but for some it's as big as 8GB in size.
