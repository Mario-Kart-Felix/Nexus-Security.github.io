Line scan cameras are advanced devices used for process inspection tasks in industrial applications. Used to monitor the quality of silicon wafers and other high-accuracy tasks, they’re often outfitted with top-quality optics that are highly specialised. \[Peter\] was able to get his hands on a lens for a line-scan camera, [and decided to put it to work on some macro photography instead.](https://pylin.com/2018/07/31/adapting-industrial-lenses-for-macro-photography/)

Judging by [the specs found online,](http://www.prooptics.co.kr/AF12k1_25x.html) this is a fairly serious piece of kit. It easily competes with top-shelf commercial optics, which is what piqued \[Peter\]’s interest in the part. Being such a specialised piece of hardware, you can’t just cruise over to eBay for an off-the-shelf adapter. Instead, a long chain of parts were used to affix this lens to a Sony AIII DSLR, converting from threaded fittings to a Nikon mount and then finally to Sony NEX mount.

Further work involved fitting an aperture into the chain to get the lens as close as possible to telecentric. This improves the lens’s performance for certain tasks, and makes focus stacking macro shots more readily achievable – [something we’ve seen \[Peter\] tinker with before](https://hackaday.com/?p=391317&preview=true).

You never know what you might find when sorting through surplus industrial gear, could could score some high-performance hardware if you know where to look. It’s always great to see a cheap find become a useful instrument in the hacker toolbox!
