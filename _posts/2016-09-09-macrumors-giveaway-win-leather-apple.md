For this week's [giveaway](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/giveaway/), we've teamed up with [BluShark](https://www.blusharkstraps.com) to offer _MacRumors_ readers a chance to win a high-quality leather band designed for the [Apple Watch](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/).  
  
  
  
  
  
BluShark makes a [whole range of watch bands](https://www.blusharkstraps.com) for traditional watches. BluShark has offered a collection of nylon and silicone designs in a variety of colors for a few years, but the company is expanding into ‌Apple Watch‌ bands and [has them available for purchase now](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-apple-gifts/).

BluShark has launched a series of high-end leather ‌Apple Watch‌ bands crafted from Italian calf hide and ethically sourced crocodile and ostrich leathers, sized to fit both 40mm and 44mm ‌Apple Watch‌ models.  
  
  
  
  
  
The leather ‌Apple Watch‌ bands [are available](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/best-apple-gifts/) in different shades of brown and black, with each one carefully stitched to hold up to wear over time. As with all leather products, expect these bands to take on a unique patina as they age.  
  
  
  
  
  
Seven winners will be provided with an $80 gift card to purchase any of the ‌Apple Watch‌ bands in the collection, which will be available for between $40 and $78. The watches come with stainless steel lugs, but BluShark will also be able to provide lugs for other ‌Apple Watch‌ finishes. BluShark is also releasing a series of ‌Apple Watch‌ adapters within the next two to three weeks that will allow existing BluShark nylon and silicone bands to work with the ‌Apple Watch‌.
