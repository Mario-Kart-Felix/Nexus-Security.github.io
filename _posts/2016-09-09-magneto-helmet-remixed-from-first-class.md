> Thanks you to Landru for the original. This magneto helmet is a great model. I converted the solid works to a .stp file for use in Fusion 360, then made fillets on the parts around the eyes and brim. I cleaned up the extra parts leftover from solid works then fixed the model.
> 
> I wanted this so it was easy to print upside-down on my CR-10 and for use with minimal supports. You will need some supports in the eyes and some around the model when printing other than that you should need to much more.
> 
> p.s Size is listed in the original model. I did not scale anything.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
