Jude Pullen shared project on [instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/Make-a-WiFi-Camera-Bird-Box-Cheepy-Cheap/) and this video on [Youtube!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aDNEA2X_hg)

> So I made a WiFi BirdBox which is about 2-3x cheaper than most on the market.  
> Make one here: https://ift.tt/2VnESbp…  
> This hack also has the benefit of using a WiFi Endoscope Camera – which as well as being affordable, is also useful for inspecting all manner of things, but also allows you to use 1 camera over multiple bird boxes to save even more money!
> 
> As an engineer, I’m still in ‘experiment mode’ with this project, so I’ve done 4 variations of the format to see which is most successful. Might be all, some or none! Wish me luck.
> 
> Hope this is a useful project for Schools and STEM projects, and is a nice mix of tech and problem solving, as well as grappling with the variation of nature itself, in all its beauty.
