There are a variety of ways to enjoy your audio, of which headphones are one. Making a set of headphones is a straightforward enough project, but \[madaeon\] has taken the art to a new level by [building the headphone drivers](https://www.instructables.com/id/Create-Your-Own-Headphones-From-Raw-Materials/) from scratch rather than using an off-the-shelf pair.

The result is a set of moving coil drivers with a construction technique involving using the semi-opaque thin window from an envelope as a diaphragm and as a former for the coil. Cyanoacrylate adhesive holds everything in place. The diaphragm is suspended across the mouth of a cardboard tube with the coil positioned above a magnet, resulting in the minimum moving mass necessary for as good a sound reproduction as possible. Judge for yourself, there’s a video that we’ve placed below the break.

The drivers are placed in a set of 3D-printed on-ear holders, and while they probably won’t match an expensive set of commercial headphones, we’d hazard a guess that they won’t have too bad quality. At the very least, it’s an interesting design to base further experimentation on.

Surprisingly few home made speaker or headphone drivers have made it onto these pages, probably because of the ubiquity of the ready-made article. An exception is [this flexible PCB speaker](https://hackaday.com/2018/09/21/the-diaphragm-is-the-coil-in-these-flexible-pcb-speakers/), and of course we’ve also talked about [home made electrostatic speakers](https://hackaday.com/2016/08/03/electrostatic-loudspeakers-high-end-hifi-you-can-build-yourself/).
