The latest [Make: Vol 71](https://makezine.com/) arrived today [via the digital edition,](https://clicks.inboxpartner.com/social/s_enc/1DDkvhiNvRAeEGnfe4lK8NoX4WI4zPaxNaY2kCWhTew.) here’s what is in this issue:

> Climate change is an urgent threat but if we makers act now, we can still make a difference at both micro and macro levels. Our cover story, the kickoff to a series that will run through 2020, gives a big-picture look at what steps we can take to arrest climate change. Hint: It starts by electrifying everything!
> 
> Then, we look at some tasty tech with the story of a seriously impressive cheeseburger-making robot, recipes to cook delicious insects, and instructions to build a Raspberry Pi-powered cocktail dispenser for your next BBQ or robot-themed party.
> 
> Plus, 21 projects including: >   > 
> 
> *   Hack the Sonos-Ikea Symfonisk to make high-quality, networked bookshelf speakers on a budget
> *   Build the world’s newest, simplest siege weapon, the Walking Arm Trebuchet
