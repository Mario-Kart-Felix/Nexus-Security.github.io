\[Don\] bought some off-brand Bluetooth earbuds online that actually sound pretty good. But while it’s true that they don’t require wires for listening to tunes, the little storage/charging box they sleep in definitely has a micro USB port around back. Ergo, they are not _truly_ wireless. So [\[Don\] took it upon himself to finish what the manufacturer started.](https://dhowdy.blogspot.com/2019/09/adding-qi-wireless-charging-to.html) Because it’s 2019, and words have meaning.

Once he located ground and Vcc pads, it was just a matter of performing a bit of surgery on the coil’s pins so he could solder wires there instead. Miraculously, the Qi coil fit perfectly inside the bottom of the case and the plastic is thin enough that it doesn’t interfere with the charging.

Want to try it for yourself? \[Don\]’s done an excellent job of documenting this hack, with clear pictures of every step. Soon you’ll be able to [rid yourself of all those pesky USB cables](https://hackaday.com/2014/06/10/stuff-wireless-charging-into-a-nooks-crannies/).

Of course, \[Don\] still has to plug the charging base into the wall. If he ever wanted to add another level of wireless, he could always [retrofit the base coil into his laptop](https://hackaday.com/2014/07/12/embedding-wireless-charging-into-your-laptop/).
