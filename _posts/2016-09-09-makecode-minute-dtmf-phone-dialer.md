In this weekâ€™s MakeCode Minute: DTMF Phone Dialer @adafruit @johnedgarpark #adafruit @MSMakeCode. Dial a phone using DTMF (dual tone multi-frequency), a.k.a. Touch Tone dialing! The Circuit Playground Express can play two tones at the same time, sending any phone number pad through your handset into the phone system.
