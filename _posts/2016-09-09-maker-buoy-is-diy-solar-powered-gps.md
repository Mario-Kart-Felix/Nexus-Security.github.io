[Maker Buoy](https://twitter.com/MakerBuoy) has [released a circuit board](https://www.makerbuoy.com/products-1) for building a solar powered GPS tracker communicating with the Iridium satellite network. Anything that can be attached to a Feather form factor board can be considered a FeatherWing so we added it to the [Awesome Feather list](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-feather/blob/master/README.md).

They sell a bare PCB, populated PCB, complete kit or a complete unit. For the populated PCB, just add an [Adafruit Feather M0 Basic](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2772), Rockblock Iridium Module, and [Adafruit Ultimate GPS](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=Ultimate%20GPS) and you’re ready to go!

For data transmission, the Maker Buoy design utilizes the Iridium Short Burst Data (SBD) service for worldwide service.  Costs of the service are a monthly modem registration fee of $13/mo and  $.06/message (50 Bytes) sent or received.
