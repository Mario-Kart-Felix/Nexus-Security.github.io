Casting metal at home is somewhat tricky, but there’s no denying the results can be quite rewarding. \[FarmCraft101\] put his incredible craftsmanship on display, and learned a few new things in the process, by [scratch building a scale replica bronze cannon and carriage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kJxOn9NU9w).

Starting with a sufficient quantity of scrap metal, he first produced bronze ingots. Getting the actual casting right took multiples attempts. First tried a lost foam cast, which failed miserably, but provided a sample metal which was put through tensile strength testing. The second attempt was done using a wood barrel form and a split mold, and was cast horizontally which resulted in shrinkage on top of the barrel. The third attempt, arranged vertically, almost resulted in a high risk game of “the floor is lava”, with molten bronze pouring out across his garage floor after the mold split open during casting.

Attempt number four was finally successful, again using a vertical mold but with more sturdy clamping. This roughcast barrel was then drilled out and finished to a beautiful mirror with the help of a lathe and a lot of elbow grease. He then turned his attention to the carriage, which itself is a real beauty featuring custom wagon wheels with a charred wood finish and linseed oil coating.

You can check out the build video after the break, but we’ll warn you now, \[FarmCraft101\] never actually fires this gorgeous creation. If you’d like to try your hand at DIY cannoneering and have a 3D printer, you might [want to give lost PLA casting a try](https://hackaday.com/2017/01/02/lost-pla-casting-brings-out-the-beauty-of-macromolecules/), or go into [mass production with some DIY silicone molds](https://hackaday.com/2017/08/09/silicone-molds-for-stove-top-metal-casting/).
