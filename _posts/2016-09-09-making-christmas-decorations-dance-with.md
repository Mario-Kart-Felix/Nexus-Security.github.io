[Adam Leventhal](https://medium.com/@ahl?source=post_page-----861b894338a6----------------------) posts on Medium about a project to reverse engineer the signals between Hallmark “Happy Tappers” toys. When they are connected together, they will dance in unison. He writes:

> This was kind of a silly project. If I had known it would end with a bunch of wholesome Christmas decorations dancing along to Lizzo I probably would have done it a long time ago. Here’s the story of how I took some beloved kitsch, a logic analyzer, sed, awk, Google Sheets, Python, an FT232H, some wires, data from a VR game, and a few evenings to make it happen.

Using a logic analyzer, the signals sent from the tappers were decoded. Now how to emit one’s own signals? Andy decided on the inexpensive [Adafruit FT232H Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2264) and some Python programming.

See the videos below ([first](https://youtu.be/uUPnrAW0AUY), [second](https://youtu.be/FCaSSJGif8g), [third](https://youtu.be/XF2ZmL9MKeA)) of the results and details on how in the [Medium article](https://medium.com/@ahl/an-ebay-addiction-a-logic-analyzer-and-a-vr-game-861b894338a6). Great work!
