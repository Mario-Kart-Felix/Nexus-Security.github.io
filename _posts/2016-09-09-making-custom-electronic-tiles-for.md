Dan Sapienza [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dansapienza/status/1201351359515070465) demonstrated custom linkable squares for the game Burgle Bros. by [Tim Flowers](https://twitter.com/tfowers).

> I’m getting excited to show off my digital board design for Burgle Bros. by @tfowers. I’ve shown this before, but wanted to give folks a closer look. I’ve built 50 main tiles for Burgle Bros. rooms and about 25 edges and floor indicators. It’s all powered by a touchscreen based on an [Adafruit Feather M0](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3403). Each tile connects via magnetic couplers and it’s address (I2C) is dynamically assigned based on tile setup.

> The main room tiles with LEDs include 4 NeoPixels and is powered by an ATtiny84 programmed via the Arduino IDE. When the tiles are connected, the system boot process detects the layout and builds a custom guard movement deck that’s controlled by the main controller.
