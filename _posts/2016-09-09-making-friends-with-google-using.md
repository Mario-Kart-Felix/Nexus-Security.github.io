The history of the film takes us back to the past centuries, as the first movie appeared in 1895. Although they already used so-called special effects, TV got its popularity later. It happened only in the 1950s when different TV shows become trendy. A lot of water under the bridge, but the cinema becomes more and more popular.

That’s why today, many users search for Netflix WordPress themes. Are you one of them? In this case, don’t stop reading. This post will tell you about must-have features. Still, before we get started, I’d like you to check out the next [statistics](https://johnkramer.marketing/blog/20-statistics-about-website-design-in-2019/).

### Here is what we saw in 2019:

1.  Almost 95% of negative site feedback happens because of poor web design.
2.  Slow-loading projects cost their owners £1.73 billion per year in lost sales.
3.  47% of prospects expect a maximum loading time of 2-3 seconds.
4.  89% of today’s users wouldn’t return on the website if they didn’t like the shopping experience.
5.  Half of the visitors would leave the site, which has no contact info. Or in case it is hard to find.
6.  40% of visitors will leave the website if it takes too long to load the images.
7.  Almost 90% of prospects expect to see your top items on the homepage.
8.  Half of the users prefer checking product pages before moving to other site sections.
9.  People prefer creative designs to plain text.
10.  Still, they would prefer plain text to the one which is hard to read.

All of these mean you need to take care of comfort. The site you design should be super visitor-friendly, eye-pleasing, readable, and rocket-fast. It is the only way you can get the audience and stand out from the crowd.

The creators of Vodi made it following the newest criteria, including [Gutenberg standards](https://wpmayor.com/lessons-learned-redesigning-a-saas-website-with-gutenberg/). That’s why the theme has almost 50 Gutenberg blocks. Use them to craft the variety of homepages, and not only.
