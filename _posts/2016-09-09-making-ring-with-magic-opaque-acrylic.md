> I made a ring! It’s using this special material that looks opaque but it actually lets light shine through beautifully. This was a pretty simple project, and you can do it too!

> This Sparkle Ring project uses an Adafruit Gemma M0 with CircuitPython to control a Neopixel Jewel inside a laser cut ring enclosure I designed. It requires some soldering, so it’s great to practice if you’re just starting to learn.
