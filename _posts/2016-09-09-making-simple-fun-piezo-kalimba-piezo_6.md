One of my favorite _YouTube_ maker channels is [Switch & Lever](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_1kQQSYFfEFcvzTH0IJkmA). In this episode, David runs through the basics of how a piezo disk works and then uses two of them, some basic hardware, and a small project enclosure to make a very easy-to-build electronic kalimba where you can switch out the tines with different objects.
