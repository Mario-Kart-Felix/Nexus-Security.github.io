I love seeing all of the ways in which people experiment with powering their model rockets using air, water, CO2, and of course, conventional solid, liquid, and hybrid motors. But here’s one I’ve never thought of: super capacitors (powering a propeller-based thrust unit).

To power the prop rocket, Tom uses six (5F?) super caps. The results are pretty impressive and the launch sound is… adorable.
