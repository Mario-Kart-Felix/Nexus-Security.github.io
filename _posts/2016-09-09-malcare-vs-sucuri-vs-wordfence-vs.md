Haven’t we all enjoyed the benefits of hosting our website on the WordPress CMS platform? With the growing number of WordPress developers and varied functionality added by its many easy-to-install plugins and themes, WordPress is a favourite platform used by over [30%](https://wpplugins.tips/wordpress-security-statistics/) of all websites.

However, we have all been guilty of neglecting the security aspect of our WordPress websites at some time or the other, haven’t we? Be it by using cheaper web hosts, weak passwords, or outdated plugins and themes; we have played our small part in making WordPress websites more vulnerable to various hacks such as malware attacks, brute force attacks, and SQL injections.

This might make you wonder on why website security is so important? Let’s start with a revealing statistic: Hackers are targeting WordPress-powered websites at the rate of [90,978](https://wordpress.org/plugins/website-security-check/) attacks in every 60 seconds!

As a website owner, that’s a very grim and worrying statistics. Luckily for you, there are plenty of free and paid WordPress security plugins available in the market today that can protect your website from a variety of online attacks. They can also quickly restore your website to normal in the event of any such calamity.

So, while selecting a WordPress security plugin, keep in mind that the plugin must be able to provide a complete security package with the following three-pronged approach, namely:

1.  Protecting your website from malware and other infections.
2.  Clean and restore your website (if compromised) by removing the threat.
3.  Strengthen (or harden) your website from future attacks.

Now that you know what functionalities to look for in a plugin, you might contemplate which WordPress security plugin is best suited for your website? Well, you don’t need to fret and do tons of research over the subject because we’ve done that homework for you! We’ve compared 5 of the most popular and accepted security plugins.

But, before we jump onto the details, let’s settle the most important debate of free and paid security plugins – for once and for all!

Free or Paid Plugin – What Should You Opt For?
----------------------------------------------

Before comparing the top 5 security plugins, it would surely be good to answer the above question? What’s better – a free or a paid plugin? While a free plugin is more tempting to buy, can it provide a comprehensive security solution for your WordPress website? Well, the answer is a resounding NO! Most of them have limited functionality that can only take care of certain security aspects of your website.

Even with paid security plugins, there are free versions that have limited features. For instance, a free plugin may have the “malware scanning and detection” functionality that could instantly detect any infection on your website. However, you may need to upgrade to the paid version to remove the malware infection or pay a one-time fee for it. On the other hand, a paid plugin is available with all security features and benefits.

Our recommendation: Do not compromise your website security for a few bucks! Always opt for a paid plugin.

Next, let’s discuss the features of each of the following five WordPress security plugins along with their pros and cons:

*   MalCare
*   Sucuri
*   Wordfence
*   SiteLock
*   iThemes Security

[MalCare](https://wpmayor.com/link/malcare/)
--------------------------------------------

[![MalCare](https://wpmayor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2018-08-27-at-12.01.47-630x217.png)](https://wpmayor.com/link/malcare/)

From its ever-growing database of suspicious IPs, the MalCare firewall can smartly block any request coming from these flagged IP addresses.MalCare also has the Geo-Blocking feature that lets you block IP requests made from a specific geographical location. This is very useful when you observe that most of the suspicious IP requests are repeatedly made from a specific region or country.

This includes measures like – use of the CAPTCHA tool to detect automated bots and limit the number of failed login attempts, along with the 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) during the login process.

Other BlogVault backup features include website staging environment and migration to a different domain.
