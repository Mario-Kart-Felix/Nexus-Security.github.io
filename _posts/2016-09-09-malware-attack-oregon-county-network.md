Per local news and reports, allegedly, a cyber-attack shook the Tillamook County of Oregon, USA when it rendered the local government’s services ineffective.  
  
Apparently owing it to the cyber-attack, the county officials are back to basics with all their daily tasks and are working about the crisis.  
  
When the computers in the various departments of the county started misbehaving, that’s when the officials grasped the severity of the situation and immediately warned the IT department.  
  
That is when the IT department comprehended that the systems had been infected with encrypting malware. To contain the infection, all the affected servers and devices were instantly isolated.  
  
There is no sincere evidence to show if the malware was used for a ransomware attack but it sure is being conjectured on the affirmative. Per sources, no request for a ransom has been posted so far.  
  
Allegedly, the Oregon city was recently struck by a cyber-attack of the same nature about a week ago.  
  
The damage is of such a severe type that along with infecting all of the county’s computers and servers it has seriously harmed both the online and offline phone systems given the “VoIP” (Voice over Internet Protocol) that they employ.  
  
Per sources, to rummage the details of the cyber-attack including the source, type, and magnitude of the attack, the county especially engaged a “digital forensic” team from a well-known cyber-security organization.  
  
There is no doubting the fact that the Oregon county systems have been shut by the attack indefinitely and there is no knowing when they’d be back on operations.  
  
With quite a substantial population to be hit by a cyber-attack of such severity, Oregon County has never before experienced a similar attack. Hence they can’t exactly mention their modus operandi to their plan of mitigation.  
  
Sources mention that the county officials have decided to subcontract a few response operations to counter the attack and its repercussions.  
  
The cyber-crisis management team happens to be the best at what they do and are efficiently working towards containing and mending the damages done by the malware.
