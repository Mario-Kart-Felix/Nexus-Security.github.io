**ESET Spots Adware Campaign Affecting Millions of Android Users** (10/24/2019)  
A year-long adware campaign on [Google](http://www.google.com/) Play resulted in eight million installations of the malicious apps. [ESET](http://www.eset.com/) scientists [identified](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/10/24/tracking-down-developer-android-adware/) 42 apps on Google Play as belonging to the campaign, which had been running since July 2018. Of those, 21 were still available at the time of discovery. The apps can set a custom delay between displaying ads as a mechanism to trick users and also check to see if Google's security method flags the apps for being malicious. If the apps are flagged, they don't trigger their payloads. Upon notification, Google pulled the apps from Play but the apps remain on some third party stores. ESET said that the developer of the apps is Vietnamese university student living in Hanoi.

**Microsoft SQL Under Attack from Winnti Group's skip-2.0 Backdoor** (10/22/2019)  
A previously unknown backdoor associated with the Winnti Group is targeting Microsoft SQL (MSSQL) and allows attackers to maintain a discreet foothold inside compromised organizations. The malware, "skip-2.0," bears some similarities to Winnti's PortReuse backdoor. The skip-2.0 backdoor targets MSSQL 11 and 12 and connects stealthily to any MSSQL account by using a magic password - while automatically hiding these connections from the logs. It can allow an attacker to copy, modify, or delete database content. [ESET](http://www.eset.com/) researchers have detailed their findings on skip-2.0 in a [blog post](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/10/21/winnti-group-skip2-0-microsoft-sql-server-backdoor/).

On clicking the Update Tor Browser button, the visitor is redirected to a second Web site with the possibility of downloading a Windows installer. The malicious domain torproect\[.\]org domain is very similar to the real torproject.org; it is just missing one letter.
