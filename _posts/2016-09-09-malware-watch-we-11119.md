**Chinese Spies Deploy MESSAGETAP Malware for Financially Motivated Intrusions** (10/30/2019)

MESSAGETAP is a 64-bit ELF data miner initially loaded by an installation script and is highly targeted as it contains a pre-defined list of phone and IMSI numbers. Once a device is infected, if an SMS message contains either a phone number or an IMSI number that matches the predefined list, it is saved to a CSV file for later theft by the threat actor.
