**5ss5c Ransomware Rises from Satan's Ashes** (01/15/2020)  
The developers behind the Satan ransomware have [created](https://bartblaze.blogspot.com/2020/01/satan-ransomware-rebrands-as-5ss5c.html) 5ss5c, a new ransomware with similar functionality. Security researcher Bart Blaze spotted 5ss5c, which appeared in November, and noticed some connections to Satan, including the malware's launch process using a downloader and spreading via the EternalBlue exploit to spread. Satan also disappeared in the summer of 2019, a few months before 5ss5c emerged. Blaze said it appears that the new ransomware is still under development.

**Malicious, Pre-Installed Apps Found on Government-Funded Phones** (01/14/2020)  
Assurance Wireless by [Virgin Mobile](http://www.virginmobileusa.com/) sold phones via the Lifeline Assistance program that came pre-installed with two types of malware, [Malwarebytes](http://www.malwarebytes.org/) [stated](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/android/2020/01/united-states-government-funded-phones-come-pre-installed-with-unremovable-malware/). Virgin Mobile offered the UMX U683CL phone at $35 USD under a government-funded program. Analysis of the phone found a variant of Adups, an application that auto-installs apps without any notification or consent by the user. The more dangerous program is an unremovable dropper that has the same code for a known Trojan that contains a hidden library file named com.android.google.bridge.LibImp. Once the library is loaded into memory, it installs HiddenAds, a malicious app onto the UMX U683CL unbeknownst to the user.

**Saigon Backdoor Swiped Source Code from Ursnif Trojan** (01/13/2020)  
[FireEye](http://www.fireeye.com/) [reported](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/01/saigon-mysterious-ursnif-fork.html) that the Saigon malware, which was spotted in 2019, is based on source code from the Ursnif Trojan. The researchers say that Saigon appears to be a generic backdoor and shows on an infected computer as a Base64-encoded shellcode blob stored in a registry key, which is launched using PowerShell via a scheduled task. There have been a small number of Saigon samples and all have compilation timestamps for 2018 so the malware may have only been adapted for use in a few operations.
