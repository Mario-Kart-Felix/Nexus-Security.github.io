[FireEye](http://www.fireeye.com/) has been [tracking](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/01/nice-try-501-ransomware-not-implemented.html) multiple clusters of malicious activity associated with exploitation of the vulnerability that impacts [Citrix](http://www.citrix.com/) Application Device Controller and Citrix Gateway. Previously, FireEye [spotted](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/01/vigilante-deploying-mitigation-for-citrix-netscaler-vulnerability-while-maintaining-backdoor.html) the NOTROBIN malware family.
