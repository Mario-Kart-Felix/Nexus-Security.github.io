Today is Manufacturing Day, celebrated the 1st Friday of October. As you may have noticed through our [#ManufacturingMonday](https://blog.adafruit.com/?s=%23ManufacturingMonday) and [Made in NYC](https://blog.adafruit.com/tag/made-in-nyc/) posts we are thrilled to be able to demonstrate that American manufacturing can thrive, even in the heart of New York City.

With the news of American manufacturing in a slump its good to take a look at the good stories of those resisting the trend. All day today we will be sharing manufacturing stories to the [Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/?s=mfgday).

> MFG Day aims to showcase the diverse career opportunities available in the manufacturing industry and connect with America’s future workforce—students. Across the country, manufacturers will be hosting students of all ages in their facilities, showcasing our nation’s most iconic industry. Last year, more than 80 percent of students said they became more convinced that manufacturing provides interesting and rewarding careers after attending these events. Events large and small will highlight how modern manufacturers are solving tomorrow’s challenges today!

There are over 2,000 MFG Day events planned this year, check them out [here](https://www.mfgday.com/events) and take part in one!
