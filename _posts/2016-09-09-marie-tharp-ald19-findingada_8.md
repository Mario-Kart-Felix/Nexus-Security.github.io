Marie Tharp was a geologist and oceanographic cartographer. Her maps of the ocean floor, created with data provided by Bruce Heezen, introduced the world to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and led to a paradigm shift within the geological scientific community: the acceptance of plate tectonics and continental drift.

> Marie Tharp was born July 30, 1920, in Ypsilanti, Michigan. When she was still a young girl, she followed her father, a soil surveyor for the United States Department of Agriculture, into the field.

So she went to Ohio University, where she graduated in 1943.
