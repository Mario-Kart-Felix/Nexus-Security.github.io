The director duo who brought you Avengers: Endgame is producing a streaming docu-series about the rivalry between Marvel and DC for the streaming service [Quibi](https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-upcoming-streaming-services-and-what-we-kn/2900-3051/8/), [Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/13/slugfest-marvel-vs-dc-docuseries-joe-anthony-russo/?utm_source=twitter.com&utm_content=link&utm_medium=social&utm_term=AAA851D2-0646-11EA-A15B-39954744363C&utm_campaign=entertainmentweekly_ew) reports. Titled Slugest, the series will be heavily inspired by the 2017 book Slugfest: Inside The Epic, 50-Year Battle Between Marvel And DC by Reed Tucker.

The series will encompass the companies' rivalries in the film arena and beyond, digging deep into their race to "establish culture-changing mythologies" in the "indomitably American industry" of comic books from the mid-1930s to the modern-day. The series will be directed by Don Argott and Sheena M. Joyce.

As for the optics of having two of the most wildly known MCU architects producing a series about the rivalry between Marvel and DC, we can't be sure. As far as anyone knows, the Russo Brothers do not have any upcoming commitments to Marvel Studios in the wake of Avengers: Endgame, but we can only hope that some DC Comics and DCEU masterminds get to throw in their two-cents as well. Needless to say, it's probably best not to count on the series ending any long-fought social media fights about the superiority of one franchise over the other--if anything, Slugfest is probably going to fuel those fires even more.

Quibi is scheduled to launch on April 6, 2020.
