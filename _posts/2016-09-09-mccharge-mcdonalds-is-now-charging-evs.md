The fast-food company McDonalds is continuing a project that will add charging points to its restaurants in Sweden, now the results are only getting better.

With the initial plans starting in 2009, the chain started adding stations to its restaurants with a drive-thru. Now, 55 different locations in Sweden feature an EV charger. According to the company there are more places to go.
