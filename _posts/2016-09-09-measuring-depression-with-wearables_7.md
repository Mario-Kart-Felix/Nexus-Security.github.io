Unlike many ailments there is no blood test for depression. Researchers at Stanford want to create wearables that can detect and help diagnose depression.

Via [Scope Blog](https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2020/01/03/measuring-depression-with-wearables/):

> Instead, Stanford researchers want to collect and analyze data from wearable devices to quantitatively characterize mental states. The multidisciplinary team includes scientists from the departments of psychiatry, chemical engineering, bioengineering, computer science and global health.
> 
> Their first step was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging to map the brain activity of healthy controls compared to people with major depressive disorder who were imaged before and after they were treated with antidepressants.
