Fratesi’s Service Station near Leland, Miss., is one such place. It has been a fixture off Highway 82 since 1941. Alongside the requisite snack foods, fresh bait, ammunition, and coolers of beer, owner Mark Fratesi presides over a deli case that pays homage to his grandparents’ Italian roots, with the likes of prosciutto, Bolpi salami, hog head souse and freshly ground Italian sausages.

“Most gas stations don’t hang deer heads on the wall. I guess you could say we do things a little differently around here,” Fratesi says. Farmers drop in at lunchtime for fried-olive po’ boys and housemade gumbo, then circle back around 5 p.m., when the seating area transforms into the “East Leland Country Club,” featuring a bounty of Budweiser and tall tales.

“These men here before you,” says Fratesi, “are sitting around telling the same lies their fathers told in these same chairs 30 years before.”

While his father allowed happy hour to extend until 10 p.m., the younger Fratesi shuts it down at 7 p.m. sharp. Beers are consumed on the honor system. As night nears, customers report their tallies in an in-house charge ledger.
