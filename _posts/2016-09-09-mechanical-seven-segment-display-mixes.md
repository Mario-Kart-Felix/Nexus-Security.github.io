We’re not sure what to call this one. Is it a circuit sculpture? Sort of, but it moves, so perhaps it’s a kinetic circuit sculpture. Creator \[Tomohiro Tsuchita\] calls it “something beautiful but totally useless,” which we find a tad harsh. But whatever you call it, we think [this mechanical seven-segment display](http://fablabsendai-flat.com/2019/11/04/mechanical7seg_en/) is really, really cool.

Before anyone gets to thinking that this is something like [the other mechanical seven-segment displays](https://hackaday.com/2019/10/13/not-all-7-segment-displays-are-electronic/) we’ve seen lately, think again. This one is not addressable; it simply goes through the ten digits in order. So you won’t be building a clock from it, although we suppose the mechanism could be modified to allow that. Then again, looking at that drive train of laser-cut acrylic cams, maybe not. Each segment has its own cam with lobes or valleys for each segment. A cam follower lowers and raises the segments as the cams rotate on a common shaft. A full-rotation servo powers the display under the control of a Micro:bit; the microcontroller is overkill for now but will be used in version two, which will allow the speed to change in response to sensors.

Watching this display change at its stately pace is strangely soothing. We love the look of this, but then again, we’re partial to _objets d’art-circuit_. After all, we ran [a circuit sculpture contest](https://hackaday.com/2018/12/04/the-circuit-sculpture-contest/) earlier in the year, and just wrapped up [a Hack Chat dedicated to the subject](https://hackaday.com/2019/11/04/circuit-sculpture-hack-chat/).
