Meditation might be a trend nowadays but it is not something new. People have been meditating one way or another for around 3,000 years. The word “meditation” is derived from the Latin word "meditatio" which means to “think or reflect upon, consider, design, purpose, intend”.

One can say that meditation is the (quite often neglected) health of the mind. Most people do not even consider sitting in silence with themselves, with their thoughts. But if you are brave enough to challenge yourself and ready to begin the exciting journey of meditation here is some advice :

### Find a guided app to start with

If you want to start meditation, even for ten minutes every day you need some guidance and somewhere to begin with. I would recommend “Headspace”; probably the number one app for meditation. This app truly helps you to understand what meditation is, the reasons why you need to meditate every day and makes you feel like you have an instructor next to you that leads the way.

### Be patient

To get meditation, you need to do meditation; and by that, I mean regularly meditating. Every day, even more than once a day. Like everything in life you need to be patient and practice as much as you can. And don’t wait for the magic to happen. Meditation doesn’t promise to solve your problems and your bad thoughts. But it can change the way you choose to relate to what happens around you in everyday life. Take your time and be sure that the results will be spectacular.

### Be persistent

The most common obstacle (at least for beginners) is finding the time to meditate. We always find excuses that there is no time to go to the gym, eat healthily, take care of ourselves. These are all excuses. You can always find ten minutes to just sit down and meditate. Not because you have to but because you want to and it makes you happy. Afterall you spend ten precious minutes with yourself. You might not have a chance to do it any other time during the day. It doesn’t matter if you miss a day or two but try to be persistent and try to make it longer and enjoy the benefits of it.

### Just do it

Start meditation now. You will be surprised how much we can learn from ourselves if we spend more time in silence. Don’t think too much, don’t read too much about meditation. Stop reading this article now and start meditating. This is the best gift that you can make to your body and soul. Discover your inner thoughts and make your mind powerful and at the same time calm and free.
