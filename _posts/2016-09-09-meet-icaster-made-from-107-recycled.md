> So I bet you always wondered what happens to all those old iP**h**ones that you’re not using anymore. Well, at least 107 of them have ended up in a custom **Telecaster**\-like clone called an **iCaster**. Yep, the guitar is mostly made up of discarded phones, and it even sounds like a Tele in the end. Below is a great video on how it was built.
> 
> Built by Russian luthier **Art Mayer** of **[Cooper Guitars](https://www.instagram.com/copperguitars/)**, the phones were first gutted of their electronics, then placed around a mahogany center block in blocks of 4. Then the fun begins with the sawing, drilling and routing. A pair of **Folkin** Tele pickups and the iCaster really has that twang we’re expecting.
