A fully private memory-boosting extension to eliminate time spent bookmarking, retracing steps to recall an old webpage, or copy-pasting notes into scattered documents. Its name and functionalities are heavily inspired by [Vannevar Bush's vision of a Memex](http://memex.link/S1zVMgKzX/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex).

### [](https://github.com/WorldBrain/Memex#your-data-is-none-of-our-business)Your data is none of our business

With most free software tools you and your data are the product. Not with us. Our practical approach to decentralisation and our economic model allow us to offer most of Memex services without causing costs on our side.

### [](https://github.com/WorldBrain/Memex#interoperability-freedom-of-choice-and-less-monopolisation)Interoperability, freedom of choice and less monopolisation

In 10 years time we envision 100s of Memex-y tools that are all adapted to the individual workflows different professions and people have. To get there, it is necessary to remove the incentives for Memex providers to lock-in their users and monopolise. The question for us was: How can we create an ecosystem, in which it is more profitable to collaborate than to compete, and where monopolisation is by an order of magnitudes harder. To get there we combine data interoperability with our financial model called [Steward Ownership](https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/steward-ownership-is-capitalism-2-0/2018/05/11). While interoperability will make it harder for providers to monopolise, because users have less lock-ins, Steward Ownership provides a company with the intrinsic motivations to stay profitable and be OK not to grow as much. Instead they are able to focus on providing profit generating service to less users, and reduce costs by collaborating with other Memex providers on core infrastructure. More details on this you find [on our manifesto](https://worldbrain.io/preorder#why).

We truly care about your privacy. We will never retain or sell your personal data. It is actually not possible for us to get your personal data because Memex runs locally. When you create Memex.Links we store the highlighted text and the url, so we can deliver it to recipients. However we do not store any IP of people creating, nor requesting them.

Apart from that, the only data we obtain are some anonymous analytics on how people use the features of Memex, this data will never be attributable to you or contain any personal data like URLs you visit, terms you search or annotations you made. Also you can completely opt out from that and become a ghost for us. We then have no indication that you even exist.

For a complete list of things we track, visit our [privacy policy](https://worldbrain.io/privacy-policy/).
