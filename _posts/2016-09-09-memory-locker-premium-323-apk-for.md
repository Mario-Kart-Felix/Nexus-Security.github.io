Memory Locker Premium 3.2.3 APK For Android

Memory Locker prevents running applications from being killed due to lack of memory. This issue can occur when you are running many applications or some of them have huge demands on your memory and your RAM size is not large enough so the system will start killing some of these running applications due to 'a state of insufficient memory. A common example is restarting the launcher when your device runs out of memory and this is really annoying as it slows down your device a lot. The same goes for other applications running in the foreground (currently open application) or in the background (widgets, services, etc.). In other words, Memory Locker can prevent the deletion of each of your applications.
