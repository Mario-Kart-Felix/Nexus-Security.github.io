> Loved how well the Mermaid in a Tub came out so I maid a “standing” version of her using the same elements. But I gave her a totally new hair I made in MeshMixer. Not 100% happy with the hair, but it’s one of the most difficult things to model.
> 
> I used the clawfoot tub shells to give her a base to keep her upright.
> 
> Made a new Bra for the clean version. Also pushed that bra into the tub version.
> 
> She’s difficult to print since the supports will be plentiful and hard to clean. The photos are of the best print I’ve managed to get so far. The hair is an earlier version in the print.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
