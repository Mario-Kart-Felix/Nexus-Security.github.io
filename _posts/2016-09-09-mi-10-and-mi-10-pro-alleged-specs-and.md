The leak doesn’t mention anything about the screen size for the Mi 10 Pro, so it might be the same as the Mi 10, but that’s just a shot in the dark right now. It should definitely be an OLED screen though.  

The Mi 10 Pro is expected to come in three variants as well: 12GB/128GB, 12GB/256GB, 12GB/512GB.  

The leak also showed the Mi 10 Pro price for all variants. According to the leak, the 12GB/128GB variant of the Mi 10 Pro will be priced at ￥3799 (~₹38,000), the 12GB/256GB variant will be priced at ￥4099 (~₹41,000), and the 12GB/512GB variant will be priced at ￥4499 (~₹45,000).  

As is always the case with leaked information, we’d suggest you take this with a pinch of salt. We will keep an eye out for more leaks, and official information around the Mi 10, so stay tuned to get the latest updates about Xiaomi’s upcoming flagship.
