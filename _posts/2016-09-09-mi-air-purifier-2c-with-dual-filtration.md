Xiaomi took the stage today to launch the much-awaited Redmi Note 8 series in India, however, it was preceded by the unveiling of an affordable new air purifier. Yes, Xiaomi today added to its ecosystem portfolio, specifically the [Mi Air Purifier 2 lineup](https://beebom.com/mi-air-purifier-2s-india-launch/), with the launch of Mi Air Purifier 2C in time for the incoming winter season.  

Mi Air Purifier 2C: Specs and Features
--------------------------------------

  

Mi Air Purifier 2 lineup has been quite popular in India over the past couple of years. It helped users tackle the growing air pollution woes in the country but it was priced at a slightly retail tag – around Rs 10,000.

Just like the Mi Water Purifier, the new air purifier has been designed for India – in India. This is an India-specific product that’s been stripped off the display on the front and the plastic body, as well as the minimalistic design, has been retained. It features the dual-filtration technology backed by a true HEPA filter that’s easily replaceable.
