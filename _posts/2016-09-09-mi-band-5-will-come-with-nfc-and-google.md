Xiaomi’s Mi Band line-up of smartbands has been incredibly popular ever since the first Mi Band made its debut in India; and while Xiaomi has been launching Mi Bands with NFC for a couple years now, the variant that the company launches in India has never had NFC support. That may be about to change with the [Mi Band 5](https://beebom.com/mi-band-5-launch-next-year/).  

According to a new report from TizenHelp, Xiaomi’s Mi Band 5 will not only come with support for NFC outside of China, but will **also support Google Pay along with other payment methods in the global variant**.  

Since we’re unable to independently verify this information, it’s best to take this with a pinch of salt, but if the reports are true (and I hope they are), the upcoming Mi Band 5 might be even more popular than its predecessors, including the [recently launched Mi Band 3i](https://beebom.com/mi-band-3i-launched-price-specs-features/).  

Apart from this, the report also mentions some of the specifications for the upcoming fitness band. It states that the Mi Band 5 will come with a larger, **1.2-inch AMOLED display,** and it will be a more contrasty display as well. Moreover, the report says that the device will be lighter than the Mi Band 4, which is definitely cool, but I hope Xiaomi won’t skimp out on the battery to reduce the weight — that larger screen will need more juice to stay powered.  

While there’s currently no proper information about when the Mi Band 5 might be launched, reports seem to be pointing at some date in Q2 2020. It’s also **expected to carry a price tag of 179 yuan** (~Rs. 1800).
