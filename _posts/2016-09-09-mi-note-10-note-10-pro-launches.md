Mi Note 10 is the world’s first smartphone with a 108MP primary camera and it has gone official in Spain today. So, here’s everything you need to know about Mi Note 10:  

Mi Note 10: Specs and Features
------------------------------

  

Starting off with the design, Mi Note 10 is sculpted using 3D curved glass on the rear to offer a more comfortable and precise in-hand feel. The initial hands-on reviews say that Xiaomi has baked a really glossy rear panel on board and the device is quite slippery.

On the front, Mi Note 10 features a **6.47-inch AMOLED display** with slimmer bezels, a waterdrop notch design, 1080 x 2340 pixels resolution, and 398 ppi pixel density. It has packed support for HDR and DCI-P3 wide color gamut as well, but that’s not all. Mi Note 10’s in-display fingerprint sensor is 88% thinner than current-gen sensors and even the sensing area is bigger than before.  

Mi Note is powered by Qualcomm’s gaming-centric Snapdragon 730G chipset, which has been coupled with up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It **runs** **Android 10-based MIUI 11** out-of-the-box.

In the optics department, we don’t need to talk about much as **Mi Note 10 houses the same penta-camera setup** as the Mi CC9 Pro. It hosts a 108MP Samsung Bright HMX primary sensor, coupled with 20MP ultra-wide-angle lens with 117-degree FOV (field of view), 5MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom, 10x hybrid zoom, and 50x digital zoom support, a 12MP sensor to capture better portraits and finally, a 2MP macro lens.  

Xiaomi is providing one of the most versatile camera systems on a smartphone with the new premium mid-ranger, Mi Note 10. You get dual-OIS and dual-LED flash on the rear, paired with new software features including Night Mode 2.0, Selfie Panorama, and a lot more. There’s a 32MP selfie camera housed in the waterdrop notch on the front.
