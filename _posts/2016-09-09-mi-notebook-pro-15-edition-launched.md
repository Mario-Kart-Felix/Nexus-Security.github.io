Xiaomi has launched the latest iteration of its Mi-branded Notebook in the China. Called the **Mi Notebook Pro 15 Enhanced Edition**, the device is an upgraded version of the [existing Mi Notebook Pro model](https://beebom.com/xiaomi-launches-mi-notebook-pro-2/), thanks largely to the latest Intel processors. The laptop remains true to the tried-and-tested design language for the most part, with a minimalist, industrial look and a ‘Mi’ logo emblazoned on top.  

Mi Notebook Pro 15 Enhanced Edition Specs and features
------------------------------------------------------

  

The Mi Notebook Pro 15 Enhanced Edition features a 15.6-inch full-HD (1080p) display with 100 percent sRGB high colour gamut. It is powered by **10th-gen Intel Core processors**, going up to the octa-core **i7-10510U**. It also comes with up to 16GB 2666MHz RAM, up to 1TB of storage and **Nvidia’s GeForce MX250 GPU**. The device runs Windows 10 out-of-the-box and, has a dual-fan cooling system for optimal thermal management.  

Other tech specs include a 60Wh battery and a full size backlit keyboard with 19.5mm keys, which Xiaomi says will make typing easier. Ports include HDMI, USB Type-C and a combined 3.5mm audio/microphone socket. There’s also a 1MP front-facing camera with 720p video call support.  

Mi Notebook Pro 15 Enhanced Edition Price and Avaialbility
----------------------------------------------------------

  

The Mi Notebook Pro Enhanced Edition has been priced at 6,999 yuan (around $1,000 / Rs. 70,000) in China, and will go on sale from November 1st. While one would expect Xiaomi to offer the device in other CPU/RAM/Storage combinations as well, there’s no word on that as of now, so we’ll have to wait some more to get more details on that subject. Sadly, though, like [other Xiaomi laptops](https://beebom.com/redmibook-14-amd-ryzen-launched-china-price-specs-features/), this one is also likely to remain exclusive to China, which means you probably shouldn’t expect to get your hands on it any time soon.
