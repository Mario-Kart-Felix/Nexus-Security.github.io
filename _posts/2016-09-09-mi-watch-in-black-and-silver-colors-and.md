Today Xiaomi's CEO Lei Jun has posted an image of the smartwatch in Black and Silver colors with matching bands showing off its design. This also shows Apple Watch-like crown on the right side and it should feature an AMOLED screen. Earlier rumors revealed that this will be the company’s first WearOS smartwatch. Recent rumors say that there will also be a cellular version with eSIM support, and it will cost slightly more than the Amazfit GTS. In the other news, Mi TV 5 series which will be introduced alongside will feature a 4K QLED panel with quantum dot technology for better light efficiency, stability and a wider color spectrum. It will offer 108% NTSC wide color gamut. There is also a new teaser for the Mi CC9 Pro, which shows the gradient glass back in Green color, and there is a Xiaomi branding. You can also see the 3.5mm audio jack on the bottom along with the USB Type-C port and a loudspeaker grill. Source 1, 2, 3
