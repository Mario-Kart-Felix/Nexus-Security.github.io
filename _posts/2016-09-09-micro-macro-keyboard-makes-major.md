Media keyboards are nice in theory. But in practice they never have all the keys you want, and they almost always have a few you don’t. Sure, you could maybe reassign the ones you don’t use, but then the caps are wrong, and it’s a whole thing. So really, the only winning move is to [make a micro macro keyboard](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=B22DCD53703007B9!29340&ithint=file%2cdocx&authkey=!ABC_NzUfKVv-T4Y) as \[littleSilvr\] did to make all your shortcuts one-button accessible.

This lovely input has an Arduino Pro Micro for a brain, and Gateron browns for brawn. That knob there is a rotary encoder, not a potentiometer, because endless volume knob twiddling is just so much nicer. In case you’re wondering, those shortcuts open Fusion 360 and Cura, but we’re still not sure what the hyphen does.

Can we talk about those keycaps, though? \[littleSilvr\] used \[Make Anything\]’s process of of printing in multi-color with a single extruder. The technique involves building a vector for each color, each of which gets its own STL file. Then you add retraction as you go up through the layers, slow the print speed, change filament colors while the nozzle and bed are still warm, and voila, a vibrant canvas of colors.

If you don’t have a printer and you don’t mind a bit of compromise on the number of inputs, [try basing your build on an existing input, like an old rotary telephone dialer](https://hackaday.com/2019/11/17/rotary-dial-becomes-usb-keyboard/).
