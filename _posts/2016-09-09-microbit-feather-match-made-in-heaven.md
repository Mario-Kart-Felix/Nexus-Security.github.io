There are lots of FeatherWings out there, and it would be rad if we could easily add them to our micro:bit projects, right? This little adapter takes a micro:bit form-factor board, like the original or our CLUE and rearranges the pins so you can plug in any FeatherWing. There’s even a lipoly battery charger and on/off switch for portability – take Flight with micro:bit + Feather! – [YouTube](https://youtu.be/o9mFmDbUkQ4).
