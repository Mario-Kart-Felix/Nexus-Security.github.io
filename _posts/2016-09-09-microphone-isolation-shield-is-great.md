Xenomorph Egg'

As any content creator knows, good audio is the key to maintaining an audience. Having a high quality microphone is a start, but it’s also necessary to reduce echoes and other unwanted noise. An isolation shield is key here, [and \[phico\] has the low down on making your own.](https://www.instructables.com/id/Microphone-Isolation-Shield/)

The build starts with an IKEA lampshade, so it’s a great excuse to head down to the flatpack store and grab yourself some Köttbullar for lunch while you’re at it (that’s meatballs for those less versed in IKEA’s cafeteria fare). This is really more of a powder-coated steel frame than a shade, perfect as the bones of an enclosure. \[Phico\] hacks it open with a Dremel to make room for the microphone. Cardboard soaked in wallpaper paste is then used to create a papier-mache-like shell, which is then stuffed with acoustic foam. A small opening is left to allow the narrator’s voice to reach the microphone, while blocking sound from other directions. Finally, a stocking is wrapped around the whole assembly to act as an integral anti-pop filter.

It’s a tidy build, and while it looks a bit like a boulder to some, if you encounter a room full of [ovomorphs](https://avp.fandom.com/wiki/Ovomorph_(Egg)) that look just like this, tiptoe right out of there. IKEA hacks are always popular, [and this laser projector lamp is a great example.](https://hackaday.com/2018/05/16/ikea-lamp-with-raspberry-pi-as-the-smartest-bulb-in-the-house/) If you’ve got your own nifty Swedish-inspired build, [make sure you let us know!](http://hackaday.com/submit-a-tip)
