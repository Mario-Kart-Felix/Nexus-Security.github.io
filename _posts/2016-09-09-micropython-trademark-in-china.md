Looks like there is a company in China that is trying to “own” the [MicroPython](http://micropython.org/) trademark – [MicroPython forums](https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=6971&p=39702#p39702). We contacted the Python foundation and Damien, creator of MicroPython, and have offered our assistance to figure out the next steps on this issue. We’ll have updates on this in our weekly [Python on Hardware newsletter](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/).
