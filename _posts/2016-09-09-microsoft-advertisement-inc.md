Microsoft Advertisement Inc.
============================

TLDR: Advertisement needs to end. It is insane to think that a piece of software, so fundamental to running computers, an operating system is selling user behavior to advertisers.

I remember this logo. Classic sans-serif italics, with an odd artifact between "o" and "s". I remember installing Command & Conquer on Windows 98 (and the bluescreen of death when I was invading the Brotherhood of Nod base). I remember the boot-up sound of Windows XP. The [Bliss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bliss_(image)) desktop image is burned into memories of billions of people around the world. I remember neatly organizing desktop icons, I remember defragmentation tasks, I remember Solitaire; I remember the Microsoft that was run by Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. It wasn't pretty, but in hindsight, I want old Microsoft back. I would have never said those words in 2002 or even in 2012.

I just installed a new copy of Windows. Through some [decrapification](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2198477-windows-10-decrapifier-1903), I was feeling pretty good. Skip through the usual Cortana bullshit to get through the very first boot, fresh, newly inaugurated desktop screen is waiting for a wallpaper change. There is no Windows equivalent of [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html), but [Glasswire](https://www.glasswire.com/) as good as it gets on Windows for selectively blocking network traffic. Glasswire is one of those companies that is sitting on a gold mine with 10s, if not 100s of thousands of users - yet this company has not improved their core product in the last 3 years, but they keep adding new color schemes. Seriously, there are a dozen themes to graph network traffic, but basic features such as blocking a domain, grouping applications, sorting, etc. are missing.

In about 15 mins, I was astounded by the amount of things Microsoft needs to phone home about.

*   Launching control panel (Settings)
*   Opening Explorer
*   Compatibility module when launching a legacy (Windows 7) app
*   Office SDX helper
*   Office Click-to-run client
*   Office telemetry dashboard
*   Update notification pipeline manager
*   Speech Runtime Executable
*   Office Langauge Preferences

Cortana
-------

Why is Cortana needed on a PC? I've never met anyone in person, have heard of anyone on the internet or seen any evidence that Cortana is a useful feature of Windows. The push for installing "AI Assistants" by the big-4 is troublesome. Amazon is practically giving away their puck-sized Alexa devices for the hope of collecting data. Microsoft is pushing hard to get people to use Cortana; if they don't use, at least have the mic on for Cortana to listen and collect data.

Cortana is so tightly integrated into Windows that it is not possible to completely get rid of it unless the user is OK with risking system stability and disabling Windows search altogether. Here is a recent [thread](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/how-to-uninstall-cortana/4bab6bd8-fe67-47bd-ad4f-7fc5bd2ffdfc) on Microsoft forums as well as StackOverflow: [https://superuser.com/questions/949569/can-i-completely-disable-cortana-on-windows-10](https://superuser.com/questions/949569/can-i-completely-disable-cortana-on-windows-10)

Advertisement Revenue
---------------------

Ah..now, Cortana's existence makes sense. Cortana is here to make your life easier, to solve your problems; so kind and so thoughtful of Microsoft to install Cortana on every single Windows 10 PC (barring LTSC builds). Even Enterprise versions, I kid you not.

![Windows 10 Editions, notice Cortana is forced in every single edition from ](https://neil.computer/content/images/2019/11/image-2.png)

Windows 10 Editions, notice Cortana is forced in every single edition from "Home" to "Enterprise". No one asked for it.

The fact of the matter is, Cortana and Microsoft telemetry is an important asset in their advertisement portfolio. After Linked in acquisition, Microsoft's focus towards advertisment has moved away from traditional ads on Bing to using rich, highly targetted and accurately tagged datasets from LinkedIn, and horrifyingly Windows 10.

I predict that Microsoft will offer a basic "Home" version of Windows for free. It will become so lucrative to be able to sell AI-analyzed behaviors such as mouse sensitivity, screentime, amortization of time amongst apps, detailed understanding of user behavior, webcam, speech and voice, tablet usage, location information, system information, etc. I could go on and on. Google has exploited user data in the most lucrative ways, but Microsoft has deeper integration, from Home PCs to SMB to Big corporations - and everything in the middle.

They even proudly announce this on their advertisement page.

Front page - Microsoft Advertisement

These stock pictures are creeping me out because they are completely and utterly irrelevant, they're smoke and mirrors to disguise the horrifying message that they're trying to convey.

And here is the juicy part that disguises Windows 10 telemetry under the name "Microsoft Search Network".

Microsoft Search Network

"Microsoft Search Network" definition is vague enough, but notice the exclusivity of "Desktop" advertisement data. Microsoft does not have a mobile platform, however, the fact that they are offering desktop-exclusive data indicates that Bing is a negligible traffic source through Mobile searches.

Microsoft is also aggregating AOL Inc. advertisement data. Cool.

I also found this recent [article](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/post/november-2019/what-is-your-customer-profiling-really-doing-for-you) on the advertisement portal illuminating.

> At Microsoft Advertising, we take time to gather and study data and  trends to uncover ways to empower marketers everywhere to be more  successful. Below, we explore some ways top marketers are rethinking  customer profiling to deliver highly personalized, customer-centric  experiences.

Yes, I presume that if an ad-tech company has access to your PC, it can figure out where, what, how, which, why for anything and everything. The scope and possibilities of Microsoft's ad-tech is so vast, that they felt the need to publish an ebook: [https://advertiseonbing-blob.azureedge.net/blob/bingads/media/insight/ebook/2019/10-october/cdj-chapter-2/cdj\_mini\_ebook\_us.pdf](https://advertiseonbing-blob.azureedge.net/blob/bingads/media/insight/ebook/2019/10-october/cdj-chapter-2/cdj_mini_ebook_us.pdf)

I'll end with the most disgusting thing I can imagine an advertiser can take advantage of, accessibility and disabled individuals:

The whole thing is full of rotten ideas, terrible grammar and poorly written corporate bullshit, here is an excerpt:

> The more people you reach the more you can serve, so accessibility is good business. Designing with accessibility in mind goes beyond compliance by providing more effective customer interactions, increased productivity and innovation. We are on a journey to understand the full impact that inclusion has on productivity and innovation, but one thing is clear: designing for inclusion means everyone can do and achieve more.

What does the following even mean?

Push vs. Pull Advertisement Models
----------------------------------

I'd like to see the world where advertisement is dead, businesses organically match with customers through a "pull" rather than "push" model. I've always enjoyed going to trade-shows and exhibitions where the entire advertisement model is "pull". Customers willingly travel to these trade fairs with a purpose to connect with a potential supplier, get a demonstration of their products and meet with them in person. Contrast it with an Instagram ad that keeps selling me noise-canceling headphones _after_ I've already purchased one or trying to sell me Geico Insurance while I am watching a lecture on YouTube.

The "push" advertisement model has created multi-billion dollar enterprises with ever-growing pervasive invasion into people's lives. It is time for new tech companies to come up with respectful, privacy-centric, accurate matching of suppliers to customers. Advertisement today is about shady tactics, store smells, psychological tricks, dark patterns, attention retainment, micro-transactions, deceptive wording, repetitive exposure; what happened to building great products so that the customers do the advertisement by word of mouth? What happened to companies that focus on quality, customer service and long-term prospects of building rapport with customers for their life-long loyalty? What happened to honesty and integrity in conducting business?

Advertisement needs to end. It is insane to think that a piece of software, so fundamental to running computers, an operating system is selling user behavior to advertisers. This is only going to get worse with IoT devices, don't get me started on those things.
