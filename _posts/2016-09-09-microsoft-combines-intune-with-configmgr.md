Microsoft has combined its System Center Configuration Manager (ConfigMgr) with its [Intune](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise-mobility-security/microsoft-intune) [unified endpoint management](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3304583/what-is-microsofts-intune-and-how-well-does-it-really-work.html) (UEM) platform, enabling users to access both using just one interface.

The combined products are now called [Endpoint Manager](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-endpoint-manager?SilentAuth=1), which makes licensing for Intune available to all ConfigMgr customers to co-manage Windows devices. Between the two cloud services, more than 200 million devices are being managed, Microsoft said.
