By Noor Zainab Hussain and Stephen Nellis (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Wednesday forecast sales for its cloud computing services that topped analysts' estimates, even as quarterly growth slows for its Azure business. Microsoft said it expected "intelligent cloud" revenue of $11.25 billion (Â£8.73 billion) to $11.45 billion for its fiscal second quarter, above analysts' consensus of $11.2 billion, IBES data from Refinitiv showed. Revenue from Azure grew 59% in the fiscal first quarter ended Sept.
