title: 'Microsoft has launched a new service, providing customers a direct line
to the top security experts from the company when the threat is bad
enough that it can''t be dealt by the customer alone. Threat hunting
service, Threat Experts on Demand is now a part of Microsoft Defender
Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), and will be available to the
customers with Windows 10 Enterprise E5 and the Microsoft 365 bundle
subscription. The venture is basically for large organisations that
although have good and strong security but may encounter a sticky
problem such as NotPetya outbreak, insider threats and cyber-espionage
threats. This is a development and add on to Microsoft security
services for customers, complimenting targeted attack notifications and
Azure Sentinel cloud-SIEM service, which became available in September.
Microsoft says, that once clicking the button, the security team will
send the problem to Microsoft''s incident response services and it also
promises technical consultation to customers on adversaries and
relevant issues by their threat experts. "Customers do what they can to
deal with these threats but sometimes they need additional help," said
Brian Hooper, senior research lead at the Microsoft Defender research
group. "Sometimes they just want a trusted partner. Microsoft has
visibility of over a billion machines worldwide and we''re able to use
that to bring out and deeply understand the threats that enterprises
face. We help them become aware of those threats in their environment,
reduce dwell time, and give them visibility into those critical threats
so they can prioritize and respond with confidence." He also said,
Threat Experts on Demand does allow enterprise customers to "tap into
the 3,500-plus security professionals Microsoft has globally". After
receiving a threat, which the customer can''t deal, he/she can contact
Threat Experts with a click of a button and there will be a full time
Microsoft employee to handle each and every request for help. "This is
our managed threat hunting capability. It combines expert human hunters
with our own artificial intelligence and automation to help our
enterprise customers deal with those critical threats", said Hooper.
ZDNet explains that the Experts on Demand human element includes:
1.Additional clarification on alerts, including root cause or scope of
the incident. 2.Clarity into suspicious machine behavior and
recommended next steps if faced with an advanced attacker. 3.Determines
risk and protection regarding threat actors, campaigns, or emerging
attacker techniques. 4.Seamlessly transitions to Microsoft Incident
Response (IR) services when necessary.'
