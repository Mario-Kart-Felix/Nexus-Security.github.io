Microsoft has announced its Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals at its XO19 conference in London. The company will be offering the biggest discounts yet on Xbox One consoles, as well as price cuts on controllers and several games.

The deals will run on the Microsoft Store from November 24th to December 2nd (that's a few days earlier than other retailers will kick things off), but Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Xbox Live Gold members will be able to access these deals even earlier, starting on November 21st.

If you want to be among the first to access the deals below, [you can get a three-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $1](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24542&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass) starting on November 14th. This deal is only open to first-time subscribers, and will also include a one-month subscription to EA Access, three months of Discord Nitro, and six months of Spotify Premium, as long as you don't already have subscriptions to those services.

For hardware deals, Microsoft is [offering $150 off all Xbox One X standalone consoles and bundles](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24542&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-one%2Fconsoles), as well as [$100 off of any Xbox One S bundle](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24542&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-one%2Fconsoles). The [Xbox One S All-Digital Edition bundle will be even cheaper, down to $149.99](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24542&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fxbox-one%2Fconsoles%2Fxbox-one-s%2Fall-digital-edition), and will come with _Minecraft_, _Sea of Thieves_,  and _Fortnite_ with some in-game cosmetics. These deals don't stand out from those that we've seen confirmed from Best Buy, Walmart, or Target, but you'll be able to get in on the savings earlier here.

If you want to choose your own color scheme for your controller, [Xbox Design Lab controllers will be $10 off](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24542&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2Fxbox-design-lab%2F900WZDF9XJVG) (starting at $59). Microsoft says these will be the best prices of the season, but other retailers are offering deals on controllers starting at $39. So if you've been wanting to buy a controller, now's a good time to do it, no matter where you shop.

And if you're looking for some new games to play over Thanksgiving, Microsoft is offering 50 percent off [on its in-house titles](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&mid=24542&u1=vergebf19&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fb%2Fxboxgames%3Ficid%3DCNavGamesXboxGames) including _Forza Horizon 4_, _Sea of Thieves_, _State of Decay 2_, and _Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice_. _Gears 5_ will be 33 percent off, but it's worth mentioning that all of these games are available via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. So if you don't want to choose, just get a subscription.
