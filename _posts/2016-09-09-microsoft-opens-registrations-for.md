Almost a year after [announcing its ‘Project xCloud’](https://beebom.com/microsoft-project-xcloud-game-streaming-phones-tablets-xbox/) game streaming service in October 2018, Microsoft has finally [opened registrations](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2019/09/24/project-xcloud-public-preview/) for its public preview in the US, UK and Korea. Project xCloud will launch in the three aforementioned countries in October, but there’s no word on when it will be available in the rest of the world.  

In an official blog post, Microsoft said that the service will be officially launched next month, and the invites will be send to _‘a small number of participants’_ in the coming weeks. According to the company, _“Xbox launched with Halo, and so will the Project xCloud public preview. It will begin with **Halo 5: Guardians**, the all-new **Gears 5**, a fantastic fast-twitch fighter **Killer Instinct**, and the online adventure **Sea of Thieves**“_.  

  

Microsoft further said it is taking a ‘phased approach’ to the public preview, which is why it is starting with a small number of participants to get initial feedback before expanding the program to more gamers. _“If you don’t receive an invite right away, there will be other opportunities; we’ll continue to open up more spots over time”_, it said. The company also said that its content library will also grow to include more games in the coming weeks.  

Gamers interested in signing-up for the Project xCloud Preview can register [here](http://www.xbox.com/xbox-game-streaming) (US/UK) or [here](https://xcloud.t-event.co.kr/) (South Korea). You’ll need a phone or tablet running Android 6.0 Marshmallow or higher with Bluetooth 4.0, a Microsoft account and a Bluetooth-enabled Xbox One Wireless Controller. The content will be available though the Microsoft Game Streaming app that will be available in the coming weeks on Android.
