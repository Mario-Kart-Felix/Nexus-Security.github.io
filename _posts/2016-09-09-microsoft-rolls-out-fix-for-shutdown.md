While users await the release of the next major Window 10 update, [dubbed Windows 10 November 2019 update](https://beebom.com/windows-10-november-2019-update/), Microsoft is already testing new features and updates for 20H1 update coming next year. Windows 10 Insiders in the Fast Ring receive new builds each week and well, build #18995 introduced a bug that saw random shutdown and restarts.  

Last week, Windows 10 Insiders reported that the aforementioned bug prevented them from correctly shutting down or restarting their PCs. The PCs would [get stuck](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/dghz3l/build_189991_clicked_shut_down_display_turned_off/) when the “shut down” option was selected from the Start Menu. The screen went black instantly, however, the PC kept running in the background.  

Microsoft has since [rolled out](https://beebom.com/windows-10-insider-build-easy-bluetooth-pairing/) the 18999 and 19002 Insider builds to Fast Ring users but the problem still hadn’t been fixed. Instead, the team acknowledged the issue and was working on a fix. It seems like they found the bug as a cumulative update (#1900.1002 KB4526447) has today been rolled out to fix the shutdown and restart bug.

In its [official blog post](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/10/17/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-19002/#f8leVqcbSoCP4sL8.97), Brandon LeBlanc, SVP of Windows Insider Program at Microsoft stated, _“We have released 20H1 Build 19002.1002, which includes a fix for the issue causing some devices to get stuck during shutdown or restart.” _  

If you were faced with the aforementioned bug, we suggest you navigate to “Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update” on your PC and check for updates. Windows 10 should already have downloaded the cumulative update, but you will need to install it manually.
