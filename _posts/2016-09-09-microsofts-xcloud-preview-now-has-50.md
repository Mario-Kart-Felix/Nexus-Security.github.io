Microsoft is expanding its Project xCloud preview today, with the addition of 50 games. The software maker originally launched the xCloud preview with [just five titles exactly a month ago](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20914375/microsoft-xcloud-preview-beta-game-streaming-us-uk-korea-features-gears-5-halo-5-killer-instinct-sot), and it's now working with more than 25 partners to launch 50 games today. Titles include _Madden NFL 20_, _Devil May Cry 5_, _Tekken 7_, and _Forza Horizon 4_. This will give xCloud testers a lot more games to play, but also provide us with a better understanding of how the service will run for more demanding titles.

Microsoft isn't at the point where it's ready to launch Project xCloud as a full service with a monthly cost or subscription model, but these new titles will certainly make it more useful during the beta period. The new games arrive just as Google prepares to launch its Stadia game streaming service next week. [Google is launching Stadia](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/6/18654632/google-stadia-price-release-date-games-bethesda-ea-doom-ubisoft-e3-2019) with at least 31 games from 21 different publishers, with an initial price of $130 for the hardware starter kit that gives you three months of service, which will be $10 a month afterward.

Microsoft is operating xCloud as a free preview, for now, but it's bound to combine this with its Xbox Game Pass offering at some point or launch it as some type of subscription service. Either way, having 50 games is more than Stadia's launch list right now and it shows the hurdles Google will need to overcome in order to get developers to publish games on Stadia. Google is also promising a lot more titles for 2020, and Microsoft will obviously expand xCloud next year as it continues to test the service.
