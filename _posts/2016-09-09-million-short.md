At Million Short, we are committed to designing innovative technology to redefine internet search. In creating a differentiated search, we aim to provide alternative methods for organizing, accessing, and discovering the vast web of information on the Internet.

Million Short started out as an experimental web search engine that allows you to filter and refine your search results set. The thinking was that web searches yield the same popular sites. Million Short makes it easy to discover sites that just don't make it to the top of the search engine results for whatever reason â€“ whether it be poor SEO, new site, small marketing budget, or competitive keywords. The Million Short technology gives users access to the wealth of untapped information on the web.

Fast forward to today, Million Short has made numerous updates to the engine, including international support, mobile and tablet optimization, browser search extensions and design updates. Our team is comprised of individuals who are dedicated to growing and powering the discovery of information for the world. Million Short is designed in Canada - our dedicated team works out of our head office in the heart of Toronto and continues to improve the way in which we search for information.
