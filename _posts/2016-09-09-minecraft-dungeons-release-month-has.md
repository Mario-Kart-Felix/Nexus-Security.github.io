[Minecraft Dungeons](https://www.gamespot.com/minecraft-dungeons/), the upcoming combat-focused co-op dungeon crawler based on [Minecraft](https://www.gamespot.com/minecraft/), will release in April 2020, Microsoft has announced. The game is coming to Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4, but a specific date within April has not been announced just yet.
