A number of folks have written short and sweet #CircuitPython2020 posts and comments. Here is a recap:

Eric Mesa wrote [on his blog](http://www.ericsbinaryworld.com/2020/01/04/what-i-want-in-circuitpython2020/):

> since [Qt is available for embedded devices](https://www.qt.io/qt-for-device-creation/), I’d love to be able to use Qt5 Designer and pyuic5 just as I do with regular Python to create awesome GUIs for my CircuitPython projects (when they have a fully-featured screen, of course).

aherzig wrote a [post on the CircuitPython forum](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=60&t=160628):

> I would love for there to be a library for CircuitPython that allows for the use of the lighting control standard DMX-512 like the Arduino libraries DMXSimple or DMXSerial. I love how easy to program CircuitPython is, and I would love to be able to use it for my theatrical lighting projects! #CircuitPython2020

> A library for interfacing with a PlayStation controller would be so awesome. 👍

> More community guides to expand supported sensors. At the moment there is not straight forward standards or guides for adding new sensors to CircuitPython.

> BLE HID Keyboard and Mouse please 🙂

> The thing I’d add for Circuit Python 2020 is learning. The one book that is out is very basic. It does not take you in very much depth. And I don’t learn well from searching through the documentation to learn. So this is my idea for [#CircuitPython2020](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23CircuitPython2020)! Also I’ve found that the Learning guides don’t always work. It maybe due to update firmware/software. But without adequate knowledge of the programing, I can’t figure out what is wrong. There are two that I can think of, the Adafruit New product guide for the PyPortal and the second is the weather station.

Lastly, Luke Moll [replied on Twitter](https://twitter.com/LukeMoll_/status/1212853363114749960):

> Neopixel DMA! istr that’s not a thing, even on boards like the itsy M0 where it’s possible in Arduino Also an ESP32/8266 port but I realise the latter has been discontinued, more of a wish than a need
