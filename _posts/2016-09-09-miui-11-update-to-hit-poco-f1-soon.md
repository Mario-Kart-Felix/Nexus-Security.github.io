Alongside the [Mi 9 Pro](https://beebom.com/mi-9-pro-5g-launched-worlds-most-affordable-5g-smartphone/) and the [Mi Mix Alpha](https://beebom.com/mi-mix-alpha-launched-specs-price/) smartphones, [Xiaomi also unveiled its MIUI 11 ROM](https://beebom.com/miui-11-open-beta-features/) in China on Tuesday. Based on Android 10, the new software will hit a number of Xiaomi devices in the coming months, and the company has now officially revealed that the Poco F1 will be one of the them.  

As can be seen from the embedded tweet below, the head of Pocophone Global, Alvin Tse, just confirmed a few hours ago that the device will, indeed, receive the new software, although, there’s no ETA for that just yet. However, Tse did note in a follow-up tweet that the stable MIUI 11 update will start rolling out in China from mid-October, saying: _“Global will be a bit behind but not too far”_.

Do note that the Poco F1 is not sold in China, so Tse’s comments about the MIUI 11 roll-out in the country refers to other Xiaomi devices rather than any particular model. The open beta version, of course, will start rolling out on September 27th, with Xiaomi claiming it’s the _“fastest roll-out in MIUI history”_.  

As reported in out detailed report on MIUI 11, the software comes with several cool new features, including a modern UI, a new font, sound effects and more. The update is set to be rolled out to a whole host of devices going right back to the Redmi Note 4/4X that was launched back in 2017. It’s worth noting, however, that most of these devices are not expected to get Android 10, and might only receive Android Pie-based MIUI 11 updates for the most part.
