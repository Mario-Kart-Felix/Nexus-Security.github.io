The Tynemouth Software blog [posts about modding](http://blog.tynemouthsoftware.co.uk/2019/11/atari-2600-junior-av-out-mod.html) an Atari 3600 Junior. Most consoles of the day had RF out to a TV for display. Today, it’s an art to subtly tweak designs for composite video out to a monitor.

> This one is a little different, in that it does not have a modulator inside a metal can like most other 2600 boards. Normally that section has a metal can UM1233 (or equivalent) modulator. There is not much information about a composite video conversion on this type of board, so I thought I would go through my process for working out which parts to remove, and where to tap the necessary signals.

The post goes through looking at the CA3086 driver chip and looking at the schematic to see what the designers were doing at the time.

The post goes into all the details. The modded board is a thing of beauty.
