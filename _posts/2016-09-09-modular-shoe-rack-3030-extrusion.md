[Modular Shoe Rack â€“ 3030 Extrusion](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4085795)

> A simple shoe rack system built around a single piece of 3030 Aluminium Extrusion. I was just playing around with a simple design that doesnâ€™t use too much filament and a spare bit of extrusion I had.
> 
> There is a posibility of creating additional levels using a second piece of extrusion!
> 
> You will need M4x25mm countersunk screws and M4 T-Nuts for each part.
> 
> I can upload a STEP or IGES file if requested ![ðŸ™‚](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png)

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And donâ€™t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!

The [Adafruit Learning System](http://learn.adafruit.com) has dozens of great tools to get you well on your way to creating incredible works of engineering, interactive art, and design with your 3D printer! If youâ€™ve made a cool project that combines 3D printing and electronics, be sure to let us know, and weâ€™ll [feature](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) it here!
