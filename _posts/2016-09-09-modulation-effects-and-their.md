> Modulation refers to an external signal that varies the sound of an instrument or vocal in volume, timing or pitch. This includes effects like chorus, [flanging](https://bobbyowsinskiblog.com/2019/04/22/eventide-instant-flanger/) and phasing, which are pretty standard mixing tools, to tremolo and vibrato, which are used mostly on guitars, synths and electric pianos.
> 
> Between reverb, delay and modulation, modulation is the least used mixing effect because a little goes a long way. And except for flanging, you’ll also hear modulation effects used mostly on a single track at a time, instead of across the entire mix. In fact, most modulation effects are inserted directly in the signal path of a channel instead of using a dedicated send and return configuration.
