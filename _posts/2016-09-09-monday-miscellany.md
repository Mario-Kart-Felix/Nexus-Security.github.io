****Owning Expression and Propertizing Speech - Freedom of Expression v Copyright before the European Courts****

  

This conference will examine the conflict between the right to freedom of expression and copyright, as protected under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Court of Justice of the EU has addressed this conflict in a number of cases on intermediary liability and enforcement, as well as in the interpretation of the parody and quotation exceptions. Although the cases only address the balance in relation to copyright, they will have implications for other policy fields.

  

This conference will be held on 7 November 2019 at the University of Luxembourg, Weicker Building - conference room B 001 (ground floor) 4, rue Alphonse Weicker L-2721 Luxembourg.
