Queen Mary Intellectual Property Research Institute Lecture Series: Nigerian Music and Nollywood Industries: The Blackhole in the Law Widens  
  

In this evening lecture brought by the Queen Mary Intellectual Property Institute (QMIPRI), speaker Professor Bankole Sodipo (Babcock University Nigeria)'s lecture will be part of the lecture series chaired by Dr Gaetano Dimita (Deputy Director, Queen Mary Intellectual Property Research Institute). It will take place on Tuesday 10th December 2019, from 5:45-8pm at: Centre for Commercial Law Studies, Queen Mary University of London,[67-69 Lincoln’s Inn Fields, London](https://www.google.com/maps/search/67-69+Lincoln%E2%80%99s+Inn+Fields,+London?entry=gmail&source=g) WC2 A 3JB.

  

This lecture will outline recent growth in Nigeria’s music and film industries. Though Nigerian music and film are exportable commodity, the lecture will identify incentives that are presently lacking but must be available to make Nigeria a good destination for international film and music collaboration, examining the sharing formula for theatrical gate takings and telephone music distribution. The lecture will also highlight challenges posed by gaps in intellectual property and allied rights including privacy and personality rights, to online and other business trends.

**Applying for PhDs**  

PhD Applications - European University Institute

  
The European University Institute’s (EUI) call for applications is open until 31 January 2020. You can consult their departmental webpages to see where your research interest might fit, and decide if one of their programmes could be the right step in your career.  
  

They are aware that some potentially interested students in the UK may have doubts whether to apply to the EUI in light of the current uncertainties concerning the potential exit of the UK from the EU. The UK authorities have repeatedly stated their willingness to maintain close ties with the EUI in the long-term, a stance that has recently been officially confirmed by Science Minister Chris Skidmore in his speech  on“The future of international research collaboration”at the British Academy on 9 October 2019, in which he referred several times to the EUI. Therefore students are still encouraged to apply. 

  
You can apply and find more information [here](https://www.eui.eu/ServicesAndAdmin/AcademicService/DoctoralProgramme?utm_source=Alumni&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=PhD2020).

  
Writing Competitions

**USPTO National Patent Application Drafting Competition**

Law Students: the USPTO invites your school to participate in the 2020 National Patent Application Drafting Competition. The objective of this competition is to introduce law students to issues arising in United States patent law and to develop their patent application drafting, amending, and prosecuting skills.

  

Student teams will be given a hypothetical invention statement for which they will then search the prior art, prepare a specification, draft claims, and present their reasoning for patentability before a panel of judges comprised of patent examiners, practitioners, and high profile guest judges.

  

Registration closes on 15 December 2019, and you can find further information **[here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2020-national-patent-application-drafting-competition-registration-77918334837?aff=eac2)**.

The cooperation covers two broad areas of collaboration:  

*   DIP will tap on IPOS’ patent search and examination expertise and services to grant quality patents in Laos.
*   DIP will allow Singapore granted patents to be re-registered in Laos, accelerating enterprise access into both markets.

New patent system in Hong Kong to launch on December 19

  
A new patent system will be launched in Hong Kong on December 19, 2019. Notices appointing the above date as the commencement date of the Patents (Amendment) Ordinance 2016 and the Patents (General) (Amendment) Rules 2019 were gazetted today (October 11) for the launch of the new patent system.

  

Under the new patent system, an original grant patent (OGP) system will be introduced to provide to patent applicants an alternative route of seeking standard patent protection in Hong Kong. Patent applicants will have the option of filing standard patent applications directly in Hong Kong, thereby dispensing with any prior filing of their corresponding applications with a designated patent office outside Hong Kong as required under the existing "re-registration" system. 

  

Apart from introduction of the OGP system, the new patent system also involves refining the existing short-term patent (STP) system to enhance its integrity while upkeeping the overall cost-effectiveness of seeking STP protection in Hong Kong.

The use of certain misleading or confusing titles/descriptions relating to patent practice in Hong Kong will also be prohibited.        

  

The Intellectual Property Department will upload to its website ([www.ipd.gov.hk](http://www.ipd.gov.hk/)) relevant materials regarding the filing requirements and procedures under the new patent system nearer the commencement date for reference by interested parties and practitioners.
