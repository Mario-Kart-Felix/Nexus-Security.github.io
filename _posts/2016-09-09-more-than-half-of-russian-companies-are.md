The antivirus company ESET studied the state of information security in the Russian business sector, interviewing dozens of IT Directors and business owners. According to ESET research, different types of cyber threats affected 90% of Russian businesses. 60% of Russian IT managers are seriously concerned about the safety of personal data.  
  
"The discontinuation of Windows 7 will play a role. Many Russian companies, despite the risks, will continue to use the operating system in the workplace. This will increase the risk of infection with new viruses, compromise and loss of corporate data," said the ESET representative. In addition, on January 14, 2020, support for the Windows 2008 and Windows 2008 R2 server systems was completed. They are used by many small and medium businesses. According to Ruslan Suleymanov, the Director of Information Technology Department of ESET Russia, this year, powerful and frequent DDoS attacks on the corporate sector and deepfakes will remain a trend.  
  
Elena Ageeva, a consultant for the Information Security Center Jet Infosystems, notes that the development of cloud technologies will contribute to an increase in the number of attacks on cloud services.  
  
According to InfoWatch, in Russia, ordinary employees have been and remain the main threat to the personal information of company customers. They account for more than 70% of the violations leading to leaks.  
  
Andrey Arsentyev, head of the InfoWatch Analytics and Special projects Department, believes that phishing attacks will be further developed in 2020.  
  
According to Dmitry Stetsenko, the head of the Kaspersky Labâ€™s group of system architects, attacks, almost undetected by standard antiviruses, through supply chains and BEC (Business Email Compromise) are gaining more and more popularity. After infecting the system, attackers prefer to use legal IT tools to develop attacks, which also complicates data protection.  
  
Yevgeny Gnedin, head of Analytics at Positive Technologies, believes that attacks to steal information will prevail over attacks with the aim of direct financial theft. "Especially if the company does not provide ongoing monitoring of information security events and the investigation of cyber incidents," said the representative of Positive Technologies.
