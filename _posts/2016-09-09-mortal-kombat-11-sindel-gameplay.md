Another fighter for [Mortal Kombat 11](https://www.gamespot.com/mortal-kombat-11/) is koming, and she's a real hair-raising pick. Sindel, the Queen of Outworld, has been showcased in a new gameplay trailer. She'll be joining the fray on November 26 as early access to owners of the Kombat Pack.

Sindel is most known for using her flowing mane as a weapon and for her sonic scream, and both of those are showcased in this trailer. Her hair grows and grapples to smack and grab opponents, and it's a part of her Fatal Blows as well. The coup de grace comes from her Fatality, wherein she holds an opponent with her silver locks while screaming at them. And if that doesn't sound so bad, you haven't seen her scream.

Sindel is the fourth of six DLC fighters included in the Kombat Pack, which was [formally announced](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-11-full-dlc-roster-revealed-terminat/1100-6469269/) this summer. She'll join Shang Tsung and Nightwolf as the three representatives of classic MK characters. The other three, inspired by movies and comic books, include the [already-released T-800 Terminator](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-11-gameplay-trailer-shows-terminator/1100-6470243/), The Joker, and Spawn. Those final two will release in January and March, respectively.

Mortal Kombat 11 is available on PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch, but NetherRealm is preparing to add one more platform to that list. It's one of only [12 launch games for Google Stadia](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/google-stadia-heres-what-you-can-get-at-launch-and/1100-6471349/), which Google says were "carefully chosen." Given that the list also includes [Samurai Shodown](https://www.gamespot.com/samurai-shodown/) and rhythm games [Thumper](https://www.gamespot.com/thumper/) and [Just Dance 2020](https://www.gamespot.com/just-dance-2020/), it seems likely Google chose games it felt could address concerns of latency in its streaming platform.
