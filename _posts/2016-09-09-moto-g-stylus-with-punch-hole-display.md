![](https://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Moto-G-Stylus-1024x787.jpg) Press render of a Motorola smartphone surfaced a few days back, now according to @evleaks the phone will be introduced as Moto G Stylus. This shows a punch-hole display, and is code-named 'sofia+' with model numbers XT2043, according to FCC certification. The Moto G8 and G8 Power are said to be codenamed 'sofia and 'sofiar', so they could have a similar design. The FCC site reveals a 4000mAh battery for the phone, and will likely come with USB Type-C with support for fast charging. It is said to come with 48MP quad rear camera arrangement. It is expected to run Android 10 out of the box, and there might be 25MP camera inside the punch-hole. The Moto G8, G8 Power and Moto G Stylus smartphones are expected to be introduced at the MWC next month. We should know more details about the phone in the coming weeks.  Source 1, 2
