> “It don’t mean a thing if it ain’t got that swing (Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah…)” Sorry, an old song (Duke Ellington, 1943) came to mind while designing this model…

> Anyway, “Motorized, Articulated T Rex(ish) Pin Walker” is yet another pin walker design, this time featuring an articulated T Rex styled body that swings from side to side as the model walks along. And while paleontologists around the world will tell you this model does not accurately represent the walking motion of T Rex, I’m old enough to have actually seen one, and yes it does…, uhh, ok, well no I’m not and no it doesn’t, but it was fun designing this model anyway.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
