After [originally unveiling](https://beebom.com/moto-razr-2019-with-foldable-display-launched-for-1499/) its clamshell folding reincarnation of the original Moto Razr back in November last year, and then [delaying its launch](https://beebom.com/foldable-motorola-razr-launch-postponed/) citing high demand for the phone, Motorola has finally revealed the new pre-order and release dates for the Motorola Razr.  

The Motorola Razr will now go on pre-order starting January 26 — exactly one month after its originally planned pre-order date of December 26 — and will be available to pre-order via Verizon, Walmart, and Motorola. The device will be made available in-stores from February 6, at a price of $1,499. It’s unclear when the phone will be made available in India, although Motorola has been teasing that it will be launching the [Motorola Razr in India](https://beebom.com/moto-razr-foldable-india-launch-confirmed/) as well.  

The new Razr was launched as a re-imagination of the classic Motorola icon from back in the day — so much so that there’s even a [special mode](https://beebom.com/moto-razr-retro-razr-easter-egg/) that makes it look like the RAZR — and comes with a similar clamshell design, with a 6.6-inch pOLED folding panel on the inside and a 2.7-inch panel on the outside. The phone runs on the [Snapdragon 710](https://beebom.com/snapdragon-710-released/) Mobile Platform, which is paired with 6GB RAM and 128GB on-board storage.  

For optics, the smartphone packs in a 16MP primary camera that can also serve as a selfie-shooter when folded, along with a 5MP camera on the inside for taking selfies while unfolded.  

Launching the new Razr on February 6 is a fairly big bet to make, considering Samsung has its [event scheduled for February 11](https://beebom.com/galaxy-s20-fold-2-launch-date-revealed/), where it’s expected to not only announce the [Galaxy S20 series](https://beebom.com/every-camera-sensor-galaxy-s20-devices-detailed-new-leak/) of flagships (whose [wallpapers recently leaked out as well](https://beebom.com/download-s20-wallpapers/)), but also its very own iteration of a clamshell foldable smartphone called the [Galaxy Flip Z](https://beebom.com/galaxy-z-flip-15w-charger/).
