![](https://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Motorola-popup-camera-phone-1024x856.jpg) Motorola has been expanding its One series rapidly. After One Vision, One Action and One Zoom, the company is gearing up for its One Macro launch in India soon. Now a new, unknown Motorola smartphone has surfaced on a Motorola Facebook fan group revealing a no-notch screen, pop-up front camera, dual rear cameras and a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner with a notification LED ring around it. The pop-up camera on the top right side of the phone. This will be the first Motorola smartphone to feature a pop-up camera. We had seen punch-hole display on the One Vision and One Action. We still don't know any other specification of the smartphone or which under which series it will launch. Earlier rumors said that this is not an Android One smartphone, and we don't have Android One branding on the back of the phone. Since the Motorola One Zoom is not an Android One phone, this might also not be an Android One phone, but launch under Motorola One series. We should know more details in the coming weeks.
