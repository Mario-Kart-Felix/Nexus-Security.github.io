Images of Motorola's unannounced foldable Razr phone have surfaced once again, this time [via the device's Federal Communications Commission certification](https://fccid.io/IHDT56XM1). [_MySmartPrice_ was first](https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/motorola-razr-2019/) to spot the listing, which shows photographs of the phone from every angle, giving us another look at its notched folding display as well as a second display on the exterior of the phone.

There's not a whole lot of new information here, thanks to the [deluge of images of the device](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20941732/motorola-foldable-razr-phone-image-design-leak-reveal-date) that leaked out last month. However, these are the first shots to give us a good look at the bottom of the phone, revealing a USB-C charging port and no headphone jack. Slightly more surprising is how much the phone's hinges seem to protrude from the sides of the device, although, as _MySmartPrice_ notes, this could be because the photographs are of a pre-production sample.

_The images show a device with a USB-C charging port and no headphone jack._

Unfortunately, the images don't appear to offer any more clues about what that small button below the phone's screen is able to do. It seems likely that it's a combination home button / fingerprint sensor, but we've got our fingers crossed for a spring-loaded mechanism that flips open with a button press. It's also unclear whether the phone's external screen is touch-enabled or a more simple notification display.

If we had to guess, we'd say these images just appeared because [Motorola will officially announce the device](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20919949/motorola-foldable-razr-phone-reveal-launch-november-13th) later today. Stay tuned.
