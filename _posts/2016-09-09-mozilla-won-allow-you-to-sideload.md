Earlier this week, Mozilla announced that the company will be discontinuing support for sideloading extensions to its Firefox browser. With **Firefox version 74 planned to be released on March 10 next year**, users will not be able to manually sideload extensions.  

For the uninitiated, Sideloading is a method for installing a Firefox extension by placing XPI extension files to the special folder inside Firefox’s installation directory.  

The prime reason for removing support for sideloading extensions is **to ensure the privacy and security of Firefox users**, according to Mozilla. _“To give users more control over their extensions, support for sideloaded extensions will be discontinued.”,_ wrote Caitlin Neiman, Add-ons Community Manager at Mozilla in a [blog post](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2019/10/31/firefox-to-discontinue-sideloaded-extensions/).  

The concern seems valid as Neiman notes that this technique was used to install malware into Firefox. Since add-ons installed through this method will not show up on the Add-ons Manager of the browser, users will be unaware if they got affected. Sounds scary, indeed.  

Mozilla, however, is not dropping support for sideloaded extensions all of a sudden. In the Firefox 73 that will be rolled out to users on February 11, 2020, sideloaded extensions will be converted to normal add-ons that will be accessible from the Add-ons Manager in the browser.  

With Firefox dropping support for sideloading extensions, **users will be left with two methods to install an extension**. The first method is downloading and installing extensions from Firefox’s [official Add-Ons portal](https://addons.mozilla.org). The other method is the “Install Add-on From File” option in the Add-on manager where users will be asked to browse and install the XPI file from their PC.  

I do think this is a welcome move from Mozilla. But, what are your thoughts? Does this affect your workflow as a Firefox extensions developer? Tell us in the comments.
