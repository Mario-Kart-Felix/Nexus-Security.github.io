Hi Readers,

In this article, we will discuss Upgrading a database to Business Central Wave 2 from Business Central Spring 2019 Release (14.x).  
  
This all is for a Business Central Spring Database that **does not include any C/AL Code Customization.** The database can only include Third Party and Custom Extensions.  
  
With this upgrade, we will replace the C/AL base application with a new Business Central 2019 release Wave 2 base application extension.  
  
**Prerequisite - **Upgrade to Business Central Spring 2019 Cumulative Update 4 (version 14.5). If your current deployment is less than Cumulative Update 4 (14.x) then Upgrade to CU 04.
