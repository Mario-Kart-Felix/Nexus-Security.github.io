Hi Readers,

I recently attended the NAVUG / BCUG Summit from the Dynamics Community.  
  
I heard a lot of rumors about free objects in the Business Central on-prem version, so I want to write an article about it based on what I know from Microsoft after creating a ticket with Microsoft.  
  
So if you heard that all custom objects are free with Business Central on Prem, sorry to tell you that **You heard it incorrectly.**  
  
I am sorry if you feel bad after reading this.  
  
This article clarifies what objects are free with Business Central.
