Today I was stumped with an issue while doing development for a customer in CAL Development Environment.  
  
While creating a new page global variable and then add a variable in the page but when I tried to run that page there were no captions in the fields that added as a global variable.  
  
It took me a while to figure out the solution of the same so I thought it would be great to share about the issue and solution.
