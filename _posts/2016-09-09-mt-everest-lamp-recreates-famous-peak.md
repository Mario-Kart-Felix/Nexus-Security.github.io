Anyone who has travelled to distant mountain peaks has marvelled at the beauty of the natural, rugged terrain. \[apoorvas15\] is no different, [and created a lamp that celebrated the awe of the largest mountain on earth.](https://www.instructables.com/id/Mt-Everest-Lamp/)

When it comes to reproducing an accurate geometrical representation of the landscape, the easiest approach is to reach for some variety of CNC machinery. Here, a 3D printer is used to create a translucent shell replicating the mountain. A reverse shell is then laced on the bottom to create an effect akin to that of a reflection in a lake. The assembly was fitted with WS2812 LEDs run by an Arduino Nano, and suspended from a stainless steel frame for an attractive floating look.

It’s a great piece, one that would look suitably impressive on any desk or coffee table. The 3D printer has served many makers well when it comes to producing attractive home lighting. We’ve seen many great builds — from the [8-bit](https://hackaday.com/2019/06/02/animated-pixel-lamp-is-a-must-for-any-chiptuners-bedroom/) to the [floral-inspired](https://hackaday.com/2016/10/11/blooming-flower-lamp-will-test-your-3d-printer/). Video after the break.
