> [Raymond Biesinger](https://www.etsy.com/shop/raymondbiesinger/) takes complex systems—economics, feline anatomy, computer programming—and breaks them down into visually captivating designs. Using design elements and color palettes inspired by mid-century aesthetics, Biesinger’s finished works combine the arts of illustration and infographics. Many of his designs were original editorial commissions for articles in publications including The New Yorker, GQ, and Fast Company, but the Canadian illustrator now makes these pieces available as archival prints on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/in-en/shop/raymondbiesinger).
