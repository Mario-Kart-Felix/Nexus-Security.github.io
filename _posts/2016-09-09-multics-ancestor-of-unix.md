The Multicians web site presents the story of the Multics operating system for people interested in the system's history, especially [Multicians](https://www.multicians.org/mgm.html#Multician "glossary: Anyone who contributed to the development and success of..."). The site's goals are to

*   preserve the technical ideas and advances of Multics so others don't need to reinvent them.
*   record the history of Multics, its builders, and its users before we all forget.
*   give credit where it's due for important innovations.
*   remember some good times and good people.

The Multicians web site contains 460 HTML files (see the [Site Map](https://www.multicians.org/sitemap.html "about: Site Map by Tom Van Vleck")) comprising over 1,000,000 lines, 601 PDF files, and 459 graphic images. The site has benefited from the contributions of many authors. Contributions are invited: if you have a correction, fact, date, name, anecdote, or picture, please share it with Multicians everywhere by sending mail to the editor.

Harry Reed and Charles Anthony reached a major milestone on the

[Multics simulator](https://www.multicians.org/simulator.html "About the SIMH based simulator for the Honeywell 6180 (DPS8M).")

on Saturday 08 November, 2014. Their

[SIMH-based simulator](https://www.multicians.org/multics-news.html#hreedsim "Current events involving Multics")

booted Multics MR 12.5, came to operator command level, entered admin mode, created a small PL/I program, compiled and executed it, and shut down.

**Release 2.0 of the simulator is now available.**

There have been multiple updates to Multics for the simulator: the latest version is

. Anyone can try out a simulated Multics or install the simulator on their own computer.
