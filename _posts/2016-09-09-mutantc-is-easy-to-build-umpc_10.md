Great build from rahmanshaber on [Gitlab](https://mutantc.gitlab.io/mutantc-handheld.html):

> This device is very easy to make, you don’t need lots of tools and parts.
> 
> No codding skill is needed. just basic stuff like uplaod a code to Ardinuo, little skill in Linux CMD line to install the driver. Little soldering skill that’s all.
