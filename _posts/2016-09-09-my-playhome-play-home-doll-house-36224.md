My PlayHome Play Home Doll House 3.6.2.24 MOD (Full Version) APK For Android

My PlayHome is a dollhouse for iGeneration.

Imagine a dollhouse where your child can use everything, even closets, TVs and showers. Where you can fry an egg and feed the family pizza. Where you can pour drinks, bubble and turn off the lights.

Imagine a dollhouse where the pieces are impossible to lose and never break. A dollhouse that grows over time and where new accessories and parts are offered to you for free.

Imagine if it was designed so that even a 2 year old could use it, but detailed enough to entertain an 8 year old.

Imagine a dollhouse that could excite and captivate your children for hours on end for less than the price of a cup of coffee ....
