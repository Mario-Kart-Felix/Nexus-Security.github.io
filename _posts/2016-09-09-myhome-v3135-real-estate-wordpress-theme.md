3\. Hard Reset Your Chromebook Using Recovery Mode
--------------------------------------------------

  

Hard Reset can come handy when your **Chromebook is not booting at all or freezing mid-way**. In addition, if the above methods didn’t work, you can hard reset your Chromebook this way. A hard reset, unlike the normal powerwash, restores both the software and hardware configurations of your Chromebook to the factory default settings. It uses the [Chromebook Recovery Mode](https://beebom.com/how-create-recovery-image-chromebook/) to facilitate the reset option. Now having said all of that, here is how you can go about it.  

1\. First of all, turn off your Chromebook completely. After that, **press and hold “Refresh” (usually above the 4 key) and the physical “Power” button simultaneously**. In case your Chromebook is not booting, connect it to a power source and then press the above keys at once.  

_**Note:** If it’s not showing any screen, press “Esc” as well with the other two keys._  

2\. Once the Chromebook shows the “Chrome OS missing/damaged” screen, release all the keys. Now, **press Ctrl + D** to open the Chrome Recovery Screen. After that, go through the on-screen instructions and it will hard reset the Chromebook successfully.

3\. **In case you have a tablet with Chrome OS**, press and hold the “Volume Up” and “Power” buttons for at least 10 seconds. After that, go through the on-screen instructions to hard reset your tablet. It’s very similar to hard reset on Android devices.  

3\. **Some older Chromebooks come with a dedicated reset key** which can be used to hard reset a device. Google has created a list of Chrome-OS based devices with their [specific reset key and hardware information](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/3227606?hl=en). So, click on the linked article and find the specific instruction.  

4\. Reset a School Chromebook to Factory Settings
-------------------------------------------------

  

If you have a Chromebook that has been given by your school then sadly, you can’t reset the device on your own. Since the Chromebook has been enrolled under an administrator, you are not allowed to access reset and other advanced options. In case, you manage to reset a school Chromebook somehow, it will still be enrolled under the assigned administrator. To truly gain all the privileges, you will have to ask your admin to unenroll the Chromebook from the school console.
