We’re going to email NAM and see if they want to visit [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/about), a 100% woman-owned manufacturing company in NYC where we not only create electronics, we create careers in modern manufacturing. [In 2019, National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) interviewed Limor, our founder and engineer](https://www.shopfloor.org/2019/04/an-interview-with-a-maker/). Limor also received a [WOMEN IN MANUFACTURING STEP AHEAD](http://www.themanufacturinginstitute.org/Initiatives/Women-in-Manufacturing/Past-Honorees/2019-Honorees/2019/Fried/Fried.aspx) honor from NAM last year.

However, it appears this effort is a political one, I expect the focus to be only on swing states.
