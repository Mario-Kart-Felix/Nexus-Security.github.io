> Nano Leaf light vertical 10 arrangement. Basically this is an accent light / night light with photoreactive automatic brightness. Made with WS2812 60 LED/m strips and Arduino Pro Mini module. Leaf body is cool white PLA, front panels are double thick green glow in the dark PLA (it has good transparency). Panels are joined using #4 1/4″ screws and the LED strips are hand wired. A mode button selects several different color patterns.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
