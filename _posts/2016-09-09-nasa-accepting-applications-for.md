Here’s one way to get off the planet. From [usajobs.gov](https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/561186900):

> Astronaut candidates will spend approximately two years training on the basic skills required to be an astronaut – from spacewalking and robotics to leadership and teamwork skills. Upon completing training, they will join the active astronaut corps and become eligible for spaceflight assignment. Until assigned a spaceflight, they will have responsibilities within the astronaut office ranging from supporting their fellow astronauts in space to advising on the development of new spacecraft.
