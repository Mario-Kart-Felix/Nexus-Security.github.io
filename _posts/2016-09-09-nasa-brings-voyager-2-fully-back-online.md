> On Wednesday, February 5 at 10:00 p.m. Eastern, NASA’s Voyager Twitter account gave out the good news: Voyager 2 is not only stable, but is back at its critical science mission.
> 
> “My twin is back to taking science data, and the team at @NASAJPL is evaluating the health of the instruments after their brief shutoff,” the account tweeted.
> 
> Voyager 2 is sister craft to Voyager 1. Both have been traveling through the solar system — and now beyond it — for the last four decades.
