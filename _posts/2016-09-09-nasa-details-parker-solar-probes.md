> The Parker Solar Probe is a specially crafted vessel designed to operate in close proximity to the Sun. The spacecraft can withstand insanely high temperatures, enabling it to gather unprecedented data on our star and its effects on our planet. The four newly published studies detail findings that are the direct result of two record-breaking Sun flybys successfully performed by the Parker probe.
