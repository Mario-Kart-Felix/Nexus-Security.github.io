> Titan is the largest moon orbiting Saturn, and NASA has unveiled the first global map of the moon. The map shows a world of dunes, lakes, plains, craters, and other terrain. Titan is important to scientists because it is the only other known planetary body in the solar system, other than Earth, known to have stable liquid on its surface.

> [The significant difference](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7542) is that instead of water lakes as the Earth has, Titan has methane and ethane hydrocarbons on its surface. On Earth, those are gasses, but in the frigid cold of Titan, they behave like liquids. Scientist Rosaly Lopes says that the active methane-based hydrologic cycle has shaped a complex geologic landscape.
