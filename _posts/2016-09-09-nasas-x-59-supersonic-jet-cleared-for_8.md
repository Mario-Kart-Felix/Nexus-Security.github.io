> NASA’s experimental X-59 jet, which could make supersonic commercial travel a reality, has been cleared for final assembly. The [X-59](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-x-59-quiet-supersonic-research-aircraft-cleared-for-final-assembly) Quiet SuperSonic Technology (QueSST) aircraft, designed by [Lockheed Martin](https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/20/lockheed-martin-quiet-supersonic-jet-nasa/), could take its first flight as soon as 2021.

> This is NASA’s first large-scale, piloted [x-plane](https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/04/nasa-first-all-electric-x-plane/) (or experimental aircraft) in more than three decades, and its goal is to reduce the loudness of [a sonic boom](https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/10/the-big-picture-nasa-supersonic-shockwaves/) to more of a [sonic thump](https://www.engadget.com/2017/07/24/nasa-moves-ahead-with-quiet-supersonic-jet/). When the long, slender jet transitions to supersonic speed, it will make about as much noise a car door closing, and since it will be flying 940 MPH at 55,000 feet, that could be essentially inaudible.
