November is Native American Heritage Month and all month long we will be sharing blog posts to celebrate. You can [check back](https://blog.adafruit.com/tag/native-american-heritage-month/) every weekday for a new post paying tribute to the experience, history, traditions and contributions of American Indians and Alaska Natives. We hope you will join us this month as we learn about the diverse cultures that make up these groups.
