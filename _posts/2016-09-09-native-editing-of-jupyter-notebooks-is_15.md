> With (the) [October release of the Python extension](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-october-2019-release/), we’re excited to announce the support of native editing of Jupyter notebooks inside Visual Studio Code! You can now directly **edit .ipynb files** and get the interactivity of Jupyter notebooks with all of the power of VS Code.
> 
> You can manage source control, open multiple files, and leverage productivity features like IntelliSense, Git integration, and multi-file management, offering a brand-new way for data scientists and developers to experiment and work with data efficiently. You can try out this experience today by downloading the latest version of the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and creating/opening a Jupyter Notebook inside VS Code.

If you don’t already have an existing Jupyter Notebook file, open the VS Code Command Palette with the shortcut CTRL + SHIFT + P (Windows) or Command + SHIFT + P (macOS), and run the “Python: Create Blank New Jupyter Notebook” command.

If you already have a Jupyter Notebook file, it’s as simple as just opening that file in VS Code. It will automatically open with the new native Jupyter editor.
