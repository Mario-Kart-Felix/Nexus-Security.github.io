> This mini cube is made up of six 4×4 WS2812B panels giving a total of 96 individually addressable RGB LEDs. Buried inside the cube is a ATTiny85 microcontroller powered by a 120mAh Lithium Ion battery. It also contains a mercury switch and a couple of transistors to turn the cube on. The cube switches itself off after displaying a series of animations.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
