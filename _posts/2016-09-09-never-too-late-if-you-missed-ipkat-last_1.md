Katfriend Fredy Sánchez Merino r**[eports on an interesting case from Colombia](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/10/a-twist-with-apologies-to-chubby.html)**, which considered the question of whether use of audiovisual works in public transport would be considered an act of communication to the public, such that a collecting society could demand payment of royalties.
