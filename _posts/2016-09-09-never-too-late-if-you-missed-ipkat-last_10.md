SpecialKat Hayleigh Bosher reports on **[an injunction claim brought by Nintendo against 5 UK ISPs](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/10/nintendo-play-isp-blocking-to-win.html)** against several websites offering devices to circumvent technical protection measures on the Nintendo Switch. This claim introduced an element of novelty by bringing the claim on statutory protection under the CDPA 1988, as well as trade mark rights. 

  

SpecialKat Chijioke Okorie examines some of the **[highlights of Kenya’s Copyright (Amendment) Act 2019](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/10/kenya-amends-its-copyright-act-to.html)**, which repealed some elements of the original Copyright Act of Kenya to ratify the Marrakesh Treaty and a myriad of other issues. 

  

Katfriend Simon Geiregat reports on a case from the French court of first instance, **[which ruled that subscribers to a videogame distribution platform should be able to resell their videogames](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/10/guest-post-paris-court-on-digital.html)**. 

  

Thomas Key explores the **[advantages and remedies to potential drawbacks of the Small Claims Copyright Bill](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/10/us-house-judiciary-committee-votes-to.html)** illustrated through the Judiciary Committee’s report to the Senate. 

  

**[Have Associated Newspapers made a Royal error publishing Meghan Markle’s private letter?](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/10/have-associated-newspapers-made-royal.html)** SpecialKat Hayleigh Bosher analyses the situation, looking at the issues of copyright, moral rights, defamation, privacy and data protection that surround it. 

  

Professor Jeremy de Beer looks at a recent Canadian decision on Crown copyright, _Keatley Surveying v Teranet_, in his Guest Post, **[where the Supreme Court of Canada held that the government can get copyright protection](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/10/guest-post-can-government-get-your.html)**.

  

**Patents **

Frantzeska Papadopoulou examines a case from the Swedish Patent and Market Court of Appeal, [**which addressed the interface between new safety regulation for packaging of pharmaceuticals** **(as part of the Falsified Medicines Directive)** **and parallel imports**](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/10/new-decision-of-swedish-patent-and.html).

  

Rose Hughes reports on case **[G2/19, which the Enlarged Board of Appeal released its full reasoning for](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/10/enlarged-board-of-appeal-releases-full.html)**. The appeal related to a case in which a third party had submitted observations pursuant to Article 115 EPC that a patent application lacked clarity. 

  

With injunctions in patent law an increasingly hot topic in Europe, Léon Dijkman looks at **[recent announcements by the German Ministry of Justice that a proposal for the amendment of the German patent act is forthcoming](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/10/industry-takes-stance-on-automatic.html)**.

  

**Trade Marks**

  

The issue of registering trade marks of football clubs has always posed a problem, as demonstrated by **[rejection by the UKIPO of Liverpool Football Club’s application to register ‘LIVERPOOL’ as a UK trade mark](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/10/liverpool-fc-fails-in-attempt-to.html)**. Alex Woolgar looks at this in more detail. 

  

**[We all recognise the mark “Uber”, but is it a strong brand?](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/10/we-all-recognize-mark-uber-but-is-it.html)** Kat Neil Wilkof analyses this mark which, whilst subject to broad name recognition, struggles commercially as a brand.

  
**Intermediaries**  
  
The CJEU published its much awaited judgment in C-18/18 _Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek v Facebook Ireland_, **[which ruled that an intermediary can be ordered to remove content identical and equivalent to that found illegal, also worldwide](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/10/breaking-cjeu-rules-that-intermediary.html)**, as reported by Kat Eleonora Rosati.   
  
**IP**  
  
Mathilde Pavis provides an insight into **[the question of intellectual property policy in outer space addressed in a recent report by the University of Exeter](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/09/intellectual-property-in-outer-space.html)**, in light of increased commercialisation of activities in space and the expectation of space tourism.
