Start to work, no clue...

**Patents**

Katfriend Joost Duijim **[kindly provided an event report](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2020/01/aippi-uk-event-report-roundup-of-2019s.html)**, summing up the AIPPI UK’s Event: Roundup of 2019 Patent Cases, which took place in London on 18th December 2019.

  

**Copyright**

Hayleigh Bosher **[reported on the most recent hearing in the _Sheeran v. Chokri_ case](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2020/01/sheeran-v-chokri-part-2-admission-of.html)**, where Chokri claimed that Sheeran’s hit ‘Shape of You’ infringed his work ‘Oh my!’. The hearing took place in the High Court England and Wales before Mr Justice Nugee on 9th December 2019.

  

Hayleigh reported in two parts on the judgment of the High Court in _TuneIn_. The case was described by the court as “a test case” about infringement of copyright in sound recordings accessed via an online platform that connects users to radio stations around the world. In **[the first post](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2020/01/tunein-to-sound-of-communication-to.html)**, Hayleigh discussed the decision of Mr Justice Birss on infringement. In **[the second post](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2020/01/tunein-to-sound-of-communication-to_10.html)**, Hayleigh discussed the terms of injunctive relief and the scope of the inquiry as to damages and costs.

  

Thomas Key **[looked into two registration refusals](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2020/01/new-year-same-creative-authorship.html)** by the US Copyright Office Review Board. Both of them concerned the attempted registration of layouts used in digital platforms. Both were refused due to lack of creative authorship, thus serving as reminders of the modicum, yet still material, requirement of “some creative authorship”.

  

In this guest contribution Hanne Kirk (and her team at Gorrissen Federspiel, Denmark) **[discussed the decision of the District Court of Glostrup](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2020/01/guest-post-remember-case-of-ai-weiwei-v.html)** in the _Ai Weiwei v Volkswagen_ case, where a photo incorporating an artwork of Ai Weiwei was used in Volkswagen’s marketing campaign. This Danish court ruled in favour of Ai Weiwei.

  

**Trade Marks**

Katfriend Markus Rouvinen **[shared his thoughts on](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2020/01/trademark-infringement-and-google-pla.html)** the possible legal status of product listing ads (PLA’s) in light of the German Federal Court's decision in the _Ortlieb_ case.

  

Hayleigh Bosher **[looked into the England and Wales High Court’s judgment](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2020/01/sale-of-second-hand-goods-not-genuine.html)** in _Aiwa Co. Ltd v Aiwa Corp_. There, Mr Justice Mann held that, considering the facts of the case, the sale of second-hand goods was not a genuine use of the Aiwa trade mark.  
  
Léon Dijkman **[examined the first IP ruling of the new decade by the Dutch Supreme Court](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2020/01/trade-mark-functions-repairs-and.html)** in _European Pallet Association EV v PHZ BV_, which raises interesting questions regarding the interface between exhaustion, repairs and collective marks. The court additionally stated its intention to refer these questions to the CJEU after the parties to the dispute expressed their views on their wording.

**Book Reviews**

Thomas Key **[reviewed Kim Treuger Bar-Am’s book](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2020/01/book-review-positive-freedom-and-law.html)** _‘Positive Freedom and the Law’_. Under Kantian philosophy and Jewish thought, this book seeks to explore the alternative concept of freedom as a duty of respect toward the autonomy of others. The author posits the notion that modern communication has transformed readers and users into subsequent authors, calling for a re-examination of copyright law through the lens of freedom as a duty of respect.

  

Peter Ling **[reviewed the book](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2020/01/book-review-practitioners-guide-to.html)** _‘A Practitioner’s Guide to European Patent Law’_, edited by Paul England (with the assistance of Sara Burghart, Judith Krens and François Pochart). In only 350-odd pages, and in a manner that can be easily digested by practitioners, Paul provides, in his own words, at least a “tentative” answer to the various aspects of the question: What is genuinely European in European Patent Law?  
  
Nedim Malovic **[reviewed the book](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2020/01/book-review-law-of-remedies-european.html)** _'Law of Remedies - A European Perspective'_ (edited by Franz Hofmann and Franziska Kurz). This book analyses different mechanisms of enforcement, the debate on private versus public enforcement, as well as the perspective of criminal law.
