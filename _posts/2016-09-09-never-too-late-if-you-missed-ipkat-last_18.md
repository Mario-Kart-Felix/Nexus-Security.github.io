In this guest contribution, Ilaria Gargiulo (DGRS Studio Legal) [discusses a recent decision](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/11/guest-post-rome-court-rules-that-iconic.html) of an Italian court, illustrating that, even for iconic photographs, fulfilling the originality requirement for copyright protection is not necessarily a given.

  

Patents

  

Kat Annsley Merelle Ward [reports on the recent announcement](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/11/ipec-no-longer-london-focused-as-ip.html?m=1) that IPEC claims can now be issued and heard outside of London, as the IP small claims track reaches courts in Newcastle, Manchester, Cardiff and beyond.

  

Trade Marks

  

Katfriend Tyrone Berger [reports on](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/11/ity-may-be-name-of-fashion-style-but-is.html?m=1) a recent case addressing the ever-vexing question of when use amounts to trade mark use in Australia. In Pinnacle Runway Pty Ltd v Triangl Ltd, the Australian Federal Court found that the name given to a style of bikini will not amount to ‘use as a trade mark’ so as to constitute trade mark use.

  

InternKat Riana Harvey [examines a recent High Court of England and Wales ruling](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/11/bentley-motors-found-to-have-infringed.html?m=1), in which it was found that Bentley Motors had infringed a small family-run clothing firm’s ‘Bentley’ trade marks through the use of its ‘Combination Sign’.

  

In [“Weel done, Cutty-Sark” - - from poem to sailing ship to whisky: What’s in a name?](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/11/weel-done-cutty-sark-from-poem-to.html?m=1), Kat Neil Wilkof recalls the singular journey of the term “cutty sark”, which ultimately became the name of a brand of popular Scottish whiskey.

  

GuestKat Nedim Malovic [reports on a decision of the Turin Court of First Instance](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/11/ferrero-succeeds-in-enforcing-its.html), where Ferrero succeeded in defending its trade mark registrations for its 3D Tic Tac container.

  

When it comes to trade marks, in order to be irreplaceable, one must always be different - [this is what Katfriend John Shaw sets out](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/11/in-order-to-be-irreplaceable-one-must.html) in his analysis of the latest trade mark dispute between Chanel and Catherine Sidonio.

  

Freedom of expression and confidentiality

  

Kat Eleonora Rosati [looks at the intriguing case](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/11/can-employees-freedom-of-expression.html) of Herbay v Hungary, Appl. No. 11608/15, which discussed Article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights, and how contractual restrictions on employees' free speech may be overcome by overriding fundamental rights considerations.
