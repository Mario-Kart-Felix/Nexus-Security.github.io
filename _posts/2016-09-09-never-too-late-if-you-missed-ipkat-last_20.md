GuestKat Léon Dijkman **[looked at two important patent development](https://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2020/01/patent-injunctions-update-german.html)**s: from Germany, the proposed amendments to the German Patent Act; and from the Netherlands, new decisions in the Philips v ASUS/Wiko FRAND litigation in the Hague.

GuestKat Peter Ling **[examined the decision of the CJEU in](https://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2020/01/an-infringement-of-ip-rights-that-is.html)** _IT Development SAS v Free Mobile SAS_ (Case C-666/18), where the Court addressed the question of whether the Enforcement Directive (Directive 2004/48) and the Software Directive (Directive 2009/24) are applicable to cases in which the infringement of IP rights also constitute a breach of contract between the parties. The facts centred around the alleged modification of software in breach of a licensing agreement.
