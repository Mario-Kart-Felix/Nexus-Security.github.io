Katfriend Darryl Ho **[discussed the treatment of full names under trade mark law](https://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2020/01/how-much-trademark-protection-does-full.html)**, and how the matter was recently handled in the recent case of _Multi Access Limited v Guangzhou Pharmaceutical Holdings Limited_ in Singapore.
