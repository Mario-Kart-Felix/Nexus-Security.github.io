Hope this Never Too Late post is not too late. Here come all the posts contributed by the Kats two weeks ago. 

  

  

  

****Copyright ****

  

  

Eleonora Rosati reports the judgement in _Google v CNIL_, C-507/17, in which the **[CJEU rules that in 'right to be forgotten' cases, a search engine cannot be ordered to undertake global delisting but needs to delist EU-wide and undertakes some geo-blocking](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/09/breaking-cjeu-rules-that-in-right-to-be.html)**. 

  

She also looks at a [**new CJEU referral on right of communication to the public**](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/09/new-cjeu-referral-on-right-of.html) relating to ‘seeding' (meaning the uploading of already downloaded content for others to download). In this case, the CJEU will address whether 'seeding' shall be regarded as a communication to the public. As well, it will consider whether there is a de minimis threshold, only above which the seeding of pieces would constitute a communication to the public. 

  

In '**[Copyright Troll-\[ing\] Canadian Courts? Canada’s First Reverse Class Action Copyright Case](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/09/guest-post-copyright-troll-ing-canadian.html)' ,** Kat friends Kristianne C. Anor and Sanjit Rajayer, discuss Canada’s first reverse class-action copyright case brought by film production companies against a class of an unidentified and potentially unlimited number of Canadians for copyright infringement, in which the defendant conducts the filing-sharing of the plaintiffs' movies with BT. 

  

In '**[Zervos v Picasso, or copyright v droit d'auteur](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/09/zervos-v-picasso-or-copyright-v-droit.html)' , **GuestKat Antonella Gentile offers a post on the decision in Zervos v. Picasso case (United States District Court for the Northern District of California). Here, the plaintiff requests that the Court recognise a French court’s judgement, granted in 2012 in favour of the plaintiff in which EUR 2 million in damages was awarded. At issue is whether the 2012 French judgment is at odds with the U.S. doctrine of fair use. 

  

  

**Trademarks **

  

  

SpecialKat Tian Lu, in '[**Beijing IP Court: Moutai is excellent, but not exclusively so**](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/09/beijing-ip-court-moutai-is-excellent.html)' , provides insights into the ruling in the Moutai case in China. There, the Beijing IP Court held that the trademark ‘茅台国宴’ (Moutai state banquet) should not be registered as a trademark for alcoholic products, as the relevant public for the relevant products might view the alcoholic products as being dedicated to the state banquet , and thus misidentify its quality, grade and other characteristics.

Curious about what happens last week

  

GuestKat Antonella Gentile reports on the opinion of AG Pitruzzella in the Cooper case, C-622/18.** [The AG advises the CJEU to rule that proprietor of trademark revoked for non-use can seek compensation for infringing acts committed prior to revocation.](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/09/ag-pitruzzella-advises-cjeu-to-rule.html)**

  

  

**Patents** 

  

  

In '[**Is Article 3 (a) of the Regulation (EC) 469/2009 disappearing into the mist, or is clarity round the corner**?](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/09/is-article-3-of-regulation-ec-4692009.html)' , Guest Kat Frantzeska Papadopoulou provides an overview of the interpretation of one of the criteria for SPC eligibility in the EU, namely the requirement that the product is 'protected by a basic patent in force'. She discusses the two tests adopted by the CJEU, namely that the product must be 'specified' or‘identified' in the claims of the basic patent (Medeva, C-322/10), and that the product must reflect 'the core inventive advance' of the basic patent (Actavis v Sanofi, 443/12). She also summarises the important points made in the AG opinion in Case C-650/17 and C-114/118 concerning the application of the Teva decision in the forms of claim drafting. 

  

  

**IP Enforcement **

  

  

GuestKat Peter Ling, in‘**[There is No Such Thing as a Free Launch – CJEU Does Not Follow AG on Compensation for Wrongful PI](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/09/there-is-no-such-thing-as-free-launch.html)'** , reports and critically comments on the latest ruling in _Bayer Pharma_ case C-688/17. Here, the CJEU held that: (1) Art.9 (7) of the Enforcement Directive harmonizes the conditions and the amount of the compensation for a wrongfully granted preliminary injunction; (2) whether 'appropriate'  compensation is  to be determined on the basis of the specific circumstances of the case; and (3) that while the subsequent lifting of the preliminary injunction because of a finding of non-infringement or invalidity is a necessary condition for ‘appropriate compensation’, it does not automatically lead to an award of compensation. 

  

Kat friend Jake Campbell reviews [**the UKIPO’s latest issued Annual IP crime and enforcement report for 2018-2019**](file:///C:/Users/wilkof/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.Outlook/VC167C29/(http:/ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/09/guest-post-uk-ipo-annual-ip-crime-and.html)). This report looks at the landscape of criminal IP infringement in the UK over the last year; and highlights the successes and challenges in tackling infringement through the UK’s criminal, rather than civil, enforcement regime. 

  

  

**AIPPI Report Series** 

  

  

Annsley Merelle Ward brought a series of four reports from a team of guest AIPPI reporters. 

  

Sarah Blair covers the first session about **[the role of copyright in the production and exploitation of art and architecture](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/09/aippi-congress-report-1-art-of-ip.html).**She also [**reports**](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/09/aippi-congress-report-2-trade-secrets.html) on the session concerning the latest in trade secret protection from the perspective of in-house counsel. 

  

Hans Eriksson [**writes**](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/09/aippi-congress-report-3-brexit-ip-in.html) on the session concerning the maelstrom around Brexit and its implications for IP, customs enforcement against counterfeit and IP in the fashion industry. 

  

Toby Bond then **[reports](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/09/aippi-congress-report-4-copyright-in-ai.html)** on the session on copyright in AI-generated work, discussing whether copyright should or does vest in works created solely by AI. 

  

  

**IP Education Series **

  

  

In the first post in the IP Education Series, Kat friend Clarie Howell [**introduces**](file:///C:/Users/wilkof/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.Outlook/VC167C29/(http:/ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/09/guest-post-ip-education-series-1.html) the Patent Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurship Club in Aston University. This club is designed as a practical multidisciplinary course aimed not only to create IP awareness but to provide the knowledge and to encourage the skills and confidence needed in students to start up their businesses. 

  

  

**IP and Economy **

  

  

In '[**Does IP boost the European economy? EPO and EUIPO say so**](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/09/does-ip-boost-european-economy-epo-and.html)', GuestKat Leon Dijkmann critically exams the joint report by the EPO and EUIPO entitled "IPR-intensive industries and economic performance in the EU". This report once again confirms the economic benefit for Europe of IPs.
