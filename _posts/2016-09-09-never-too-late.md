The IPKat brings exciting new posts every week. If you missed the most recent posts, it is never too late to catch up!

**Patents **

**

  

  

In **'[When is the “text-intended for grant” not intended for grant?](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/10/when-is-text-intended-for-grant-not.html)' , **Rose Hughes reports on the decision of the Board of Appeal of the EPO in T 1003/19. There, the BOA held that 'the text intended to grant' is not intended for grant when the document provided as the 'text-intended for grant' contains significant amendments that: 1) potentially render the claims non-compatible with the EPC; 2) were not submitted by the applicant; and 3) are never explicitly described to the applicant by the Examining Division. 

  

In **'[A casual case of contempt? Price v Filtcraft](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/10/a-casual-case-of-contempt-price-v.html)'**, Rose also reports on the _Price v Filtcraft_ decision on what happens if the infringement continues after a court orders an injunction. The High Court of UK held that the defendant in the case continued to infringe the patent by distributing brochures containing a drawing that represents the elements of the patent claims.

**Trademarks **

  

  

Léon Dijkman reports on AG Tanchev’s opinion in the case C-371/18 Sky and others, in which [**the AG finds that lack of intention to use a trade mark can be indicative of bad faith. As well, insufficiently clear and precise registrations may be contrary to public policy**](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/10/breaking-g-tanchev-finds-lack-of.html)

  

In **'[When the unicorn loves its name recognition, but Wall Street, less so](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/10/when-unicorn-loves-its-name-recognition.html)',** Neil Wilkof argues that a widely recognised trademark might provide a commercial benefit, at least when unicorns (a privately held start-up that shows rapid growth but no profits) are concerned. He cautions, however, that while strong name might influence private investors, they are not likely to affect financing by the public, such as an IPO. 

  

Fredy Sánchez Merino, in **['That was a long break, now let’s go back south'](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/10/that-was-long-break-now-lets-go-back.html)** prepared a round-up of IP developments in Central and South America: (i) Argentina’s announcement of a PPH pilot program with China; (ii) a fashion firm in Cuba pointing to a potential trademark challenge against ZARA; (iii) the decision of the Colombian Superintendency of Industry and Commerce (SIC) on the registration of the trademark Nivea; and (iv) the same agency’s decision to grant the denomination of origin for the Providence Island Black Crab in class 29. 

  

  

**Copyright **

  

  

In **'[A European perspective on paparazzi photographs of celebrities and lawsuits against celebrities over the posting of photographs of themselves](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/10/a-european-perspective-on-paparazzi.html)',** Eleonora Rosati offers her insight on the issue of when celebrities post photographs of themselves without authorisation of the paparazzi. She concludes that it may be questionable that copyright protection can be successfully invoked for photographs whose only merit appears to be that of being at the right place at the right time. 

  

  

**Conference Reports **

  

  

Katharine Stephens, in **'[IP and AI - the debate continues, this time at WIPO](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/10/guest-post-ip-and-ai-debate-continues.html)',** offers a report on the WIPO's Conference 'Conversation on IP and AI'.The discussion and presentations in this conference concerned the impact of AI on IP systems, IP policies, IP rights management and international cooperation on IP matters.

In [**Day 2 of the seminar**](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/10/guest-post-ip-in-automotive-industry-ip.html), participants got up early for discussions about litigation trends, big data, SEPs and 5G, IP valuation, and trademarks and brands in the automotive industry.

The book provides a roadmap for addressing these issues, including looking at what the rules should be, who should shape them and how the rules should be applied.
