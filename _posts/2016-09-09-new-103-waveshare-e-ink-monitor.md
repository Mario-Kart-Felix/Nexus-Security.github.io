Waveshare has released a new 10.3-inch E Ink monitor that has an HDMI port and supports all versions of Raspberry Pi, along with Jetson Nano and Windows PCs.

They’re selling it from the [Waveshare website](https://www.waveshare.com/eink-disp-103.htm?sku=17615) for $539.99 plus shipping. It’s also available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Waveshare-10-3inch-Interface-Supports-Raspberry/dp/B083J21JDV/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=ter000-20&linkId=f0451dcf11553cd8d27bcba40989914a&language=en_US) for $626 with free shipping.

Waveshare sells a number of E Ink products, mostly panels for Raspberry Pi devices, it seems.

For example, you can buy a 10.3-inch panel with an embedded controller for $234 from [Waveshare’s Amazon store](https://www.amazon.com/Waveshare-10-3inch-HAT-Resolution-Communicating/dp/B07TVWLSFY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=ter000-20&linkId=6600e51bb144a864bda762144a3bd55b&language=en_US).

This new E Ink monitor, part number EINK-DISP-103, adds some additional parts to the hardware.

It has an aluminum alloy enclosure, a mini HDMI port, a 5V power supply, and it has buttons for contrast adjustment, screen refresh, and mode switch to toggle different refresh settings.

The 10.3-inch E Ink screen has a resolution of 1872 x 1404 (that’s 226 ppi). It doesn’t have a touchscreen or a frontlight.

This new Waveshare monitor is more basic but it’s a lot cheaper than other E Ink monitors like the [Dasung Paperlike](https://www.amazon.com/Dasung-Paperlike-Front-Light-Touch-Monitor/dp/B07SKS6CS7/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=ter000-20&linkId=b705f8a2140c9a5ddf799e477fc90a36&language=en_US) and [Onyx Max3](https://blog.the-ebook-reader.com/2019/10/06/onyx-boox-max3-review-and-video-walkthrough/), but those also have a larger 13.3-inch E Ink screen.
