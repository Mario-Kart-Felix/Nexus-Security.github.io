---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> A quick look at the new 3D printed animatronic eye mechanisms I’ve built. Starting in the next few weeks, I’ll be releasing a series of videos showing you how to use 3D printing and arduino microcontrollers to build my eye mechanisms as well as a controller and realistic eyes.
> 
> I also talk about the state of other ongoing projects you might have seen on my channel.
> 
> Check back for the link to the Nilheim Mechatronics site, there’s just a few things I need to tidy up before I launch it!

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!

The [Adafruit Learning System](http://learn.adafruit.com) has dozens of great tools to get you well on your way to creating incredible works of engineering, interactive art, and design with your 3D printer! If you’ve made a cool project that combines 3D printing and electronics, be sure to let us know, and we’ll [feature](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) it here!
