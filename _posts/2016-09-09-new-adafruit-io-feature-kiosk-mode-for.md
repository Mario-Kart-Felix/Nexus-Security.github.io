As of this morning, [Adafruit IO Dashboards](http://io.adafruit.com/) have a new “kiosk mode” URL that will launch the dashboard in a “no browsing mode” without any of the surrounding page. This is super-handy if you’re designing an exhibit or would like to use a [Raspberry Pi + HDMI Display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2232) to monitor your Adafruit IO Feeds.

To enable this feature, visit any Adafruit IO Dashboard. **Make the dashboard public** and **click the “Share this Dashboard” button**:

You can also add `?kiosk=true` to an Adafruit IO Dashboard URL to switch to the dashboard to kiosk mode.

Here’s what a regular Adafruit IO Dashboard looks like…

And in Kiosk Mode…

It’s important to note that you will need to manually make the browser fullscreen to take full advantage of Kiosk Mode, browser vendors prevent us from doing this. (If this was allowed by the vendor, every time you visit a “sketchy” url, your browser view could take over your entire screen).
