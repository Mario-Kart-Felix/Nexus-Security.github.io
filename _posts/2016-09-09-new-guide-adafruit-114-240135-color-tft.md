A new guide in the Adafruit Learning System: [Adafruit 1.14″ 240×135 Color TFT Breakout LCD Display](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-1-14-240x135-color-tft-breakout).

> Say hello to our **1.14″ 240×135 Color TFT Display w/ MicroSD Card Breakout **– we think it’s **T**–**F**–**T**errific! It’s the size of your thumbnail, with glorious 240×135 high res pixel color. This very very small display is only 1.14″ diagonal, packed with RGB pixels, for making very small, high-density displays.

> We’ve been looking for a display like this for a long time – it’s **so small** only 1.14″ diagonal but has a high density 260 ppi, 240×135 pixel display with full-angle viewing. It _looks_ a lot like our 0.96″ 160×80 display, but has 2.5x as many pixels. We’ve seen displays of this caliber used in smartwatches and small electronic devices but they’ve always used a MIPI interface. Finally, we found one that is SPI, and it has a friendly display driver, so it works with any and all microcontrollers or microcomputers!
