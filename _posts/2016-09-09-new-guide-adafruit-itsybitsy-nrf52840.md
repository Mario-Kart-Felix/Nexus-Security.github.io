_What’s smaller than a Feather but larger than a Trinket? It’s an Adafruit ItsyBitsy nRF52840 Express!_

It’s an [**Adafruit ItsyBitsy nRF52840 Express**](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4481) featuring the **Nordic nRF52840 Bluetooth LE** processor! Teensy & powerful, with an fast nRF52840 Cortex M4 processor running at 64 MHz and 1 MB of FLASH – this microcontroller board is perfect when you want something very compact, with a heap-load of memory and Bluetooth LE support This Itsy is your best option for tiny wireless connectivity – it can act as both a BLE central and peripheral, with support in both Arduino and CircuitPython.

ItsyBitsy nRF52840 Express is only 1.4″ long by 0.7″ wide, but has 6 power pins, 21 digital GPIO pins (6 of which can be analog in). It’s the same chip as the [Feather nRF52840](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4062) but _really really small_. So it’s great for those really compact builds. It even comes with 2MB of QSPI Flash built in, for data logging, file storage, or CircuitPython code.

The new [Adafruit ItsyBitsy nRF52840 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-itsybitsy-nrf52840-express) gives you an overview of the ItsyBitsy nRF52840, detailed information about all the features, and provides setup instructions for both CircuitPython and Arduino. If you’re looking for help getting started with your new ItsyBitsy nRF52840, this guide has everything you need.
