Getting ready for the high tech holidays?! [This new guide from John Park](https://learn.adafruit.com/hide-n-seek-bluefruit-ornament/overview) will help you add a colorful twist to a gift scavenger hunt using BLE signal strength tracking and color broadcasting to find presents.

> Stage a creative gift hunt all around your home with Bluetooth LE tracking ornaments! Circuit Playground Bluefruit boards can hone in on the proximity of other boards broadcasting their own signal including color coding! The stronger the signal, the more NeoPixels light up. All coded with CircuitPython.
