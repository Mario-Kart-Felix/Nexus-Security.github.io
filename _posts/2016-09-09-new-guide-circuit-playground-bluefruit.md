_Control NeoPixel colors and animations wirelessly over Bluetooth!_

The [Circuit Playground Bluefruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4333) has all kinds of features built in, including NeoPixels, an accelerometer, two buttons, alligator-clip-friendly pads and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This project uses these features to create a wireless NeoPixel animation and color remote control using [CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython). Add a couple of batteries and alligator-clip NeoPixel strips, and youâ€™ll have everything you need to complete this festive project. No soldering needed!
