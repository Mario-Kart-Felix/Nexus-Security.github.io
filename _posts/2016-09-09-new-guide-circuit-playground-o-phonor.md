A new guide in the Adafruit Learning System: [Circuit Playground-O-Phonor](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuit-playground-o-phonor/overview)

With a simple musical recorder, you can both make lights corresponding to the notes played or display the note being played.

> Remember the [holophonor](https://futurama.fandom.com/wiki/Holophonor) from [Futurama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama)? It was (will be?) a musical instrument that would project holograms depending on the mood of the note played.
> 
> Being a futuristic instrument, the inner workings of the holophonor are unknown. However, the basic idea of being able to detect the frequency of musical notes is something we can possibly emulate. And that is what we’ll explore in this guide using a fairly simple technique.
> 
> We’ll also use the frequency detection to drive NeoPixels (our version of the holophonor) and also show how a [TFT Gizmo](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4367) can be used to display the note information.
