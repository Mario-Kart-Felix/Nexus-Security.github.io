This new guide, [CircuitPython BLE Advertising Beacons](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-ble-advertising-beacons/overview),  shows you how to create Bluetooth beacons on any nRF52840 board from Adafruit. These can be used to advertise a URL to a mobile app in a very localized scenario, such as a guided tour in a museum space.

Plus, the CLUE version can also serve up auto-generated QR codes.

> Beacons are low power, low cost Bluetooth LE devices that can be used for a very simple job: to advertise a URL to users running an app on their mobile device within range of the device!
> 
> Technically, beacons can also be used for a few different scenarios where a localized, wireless data broadcast is desirable, such as indoor location tracking, point of sales/marketing, and experience personalization.
> 
> We’ll create two version — first, a simple beacon that can run on any CircuitPython capable nRF52840 board. Second, a custom version for the CLUE board that also shows QR codes and allows you to scroll among multiple beacon URL choices to advertise!
