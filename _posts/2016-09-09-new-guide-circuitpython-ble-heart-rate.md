NEW GUIDE ALERT: [CircuitPython BLE Heart Rate Zone Trainer Display](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-ble-heart-rate-monitor-gizmo/overview)

Heart rate zone training can be an excellent way to monitor workout intensity and increase your fitness and endurance. For example, warm up at 50-60%, then enter the “fitness zone” of 60-70% for a period, then go into the “aerobic zone” of 70-80%, finally peak in the “intense anaerobic zone” of 80-90%.

Using a Bluetooth LE heart rate monitor armband or chest strap, you can send up-to-the moment heart rate data to a battery-powered Feather nRF5280 Bluefruit equipped with a pair of seven segment LED displays.

Place it on a wall or shelf where you can easily see it while you work out! Or carry it or hook it to your bike. CircuitPython makes it straightforward to connect to your heart rate monitor and stream the heart rate data and zone percentages to the displays.
