A new guide in the Adafruit Learning System:Â [A CircuitPython BLE Remote Control On/](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-ble-remote-control-on-off/overview)[Off Switch](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-ble-remote-control-on-off/overview)

This tutorial builds a remote Bluetooth low energy switch, attached to the front of a server, which can be turned on or off remotely. The peripheral will also wirelessly report whether the server is on or off.

> This CircuitPython tutorial demonstrates how to build a battery powered Bluetooth BLE remote control to operate a BLE peripheral hosting a solenoid and a spectrally selective light detector. Two [Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express boards](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4062) will be used for the BLE client and server.
