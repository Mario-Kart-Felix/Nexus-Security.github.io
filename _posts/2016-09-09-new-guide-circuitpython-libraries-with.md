A new guide today in the Adafruit Learning System: [CircuitPython Libraries with the Binho Nova Multi-Protocol USB Host Adapter](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-with-binho-nova-multi-protocol-usb-host-adapter/overview)

> The _**Binho Nova**_ Multi-Protocol USB Host Adapter allows you to interface your computer directly to hardware circuits. This device is powered by the USB connection to the host PC and is also able to provide downstream power to test circuits. The following guide details how to use a _**Binho Nova**_ with [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) libraries to interface with sensors and components via _I2C_ (Inter-Integrated Circuit), _SPI_ (Serial Peripheral Interface), _GPIO’s_ (General Purpose Input/Output), or _UART_ (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter).

See how easy it is to use the Binho Nova to connect to sensors using Python and CircuitPython Blinka on your desktop/laptop – no microcontroller required.
