There is a new guide in the Adafruit Learning System: [CircuitPython Powered Sip & Puff with ST LPS33HW Pressure Sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/st-lps33-and-circuitpython-sip-and-puff) by Bryan Siepert

> Sip and Puff (SNP) devices are one example of Assistive Technology that allow one to interact with things by applying negative or positive pressure to a straw or tube in their mouth. This is done by either sipping on the tube, like a straw, or puffing into it, like when you blow bubbles in your milk until your parental unit (or partner) makes you stop.
> 
> Here, we show how with the right sensors, microcontrollers, and software, it can be relatively easy to make a very basic but expandable Sip and Puff device. It is a fun, easy project that you can use to learn a bit more about them and how they might be used.
> 
> The heart of this project is a STMicroelectronics (ST) LPS33HW MEMS pressure sensor mounted to an Adafruit breakout board with built in STEMMA QT connectors and support circuitry. Importantly the LPS33HW has a metal port on top like a hat and a groove for fitting an o-ring. With 24-bit pressure data output, an absolute pressure range of 260-1260 hPa ( [hectopascals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit))) ), and the ability to work in absolute or relative modes, this sensor is the perfect tool for the job.
