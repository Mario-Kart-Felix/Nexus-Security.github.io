This guide turns a [TFT Gizmo](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4367) into a conversation heart, just like those chalky candies that show up around Valentines. The code is written in [CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython) and can run on the [Circuit Playground Bluefruit](http://www.adafruit.com/product/4333). If you bought an [AdaBox014](https://learn.adafruit.com/adabox014), then you have everything you need. Or you can get the items from the links below.

Two versions of the code are provided. The first is a simple one that will let you set predefined messages and colors and then cycle through them by pressing the buttons on the Circuit Playground. The second one uses the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) feature of the Circuit Playground Bluefruit along with the [Adafruit Bluefruit LE Connect app](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-le-connect) to allow you to set message and colors from your BLE enabled smart phone or tablet.
