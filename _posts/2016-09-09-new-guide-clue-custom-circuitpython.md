_Clue in at a conference with the CLUE custom badge!_

It’s easy to turn your [Adafruit CLUE](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4500) into a custom conference or event badge using the [Adafruit CircuitPython PyBadger library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_PyBadger). The new custom badge feature of PyBadger makes it simple to display multiple lines of text over a colored background or bitmap image.

The new [CLUE Custom CircuitPython Badge](https://learn.adafruit.com/clue-custom-circuit-python-badge) guide will show you how to create a badge displaying your Twitter handle, name, job title and pronouns with a color-block or image background. Then, once the badge is created, the guide walks you through each feature of the badge and exactly what you can customise within each feature. If you’re looking to create a custom badge for your next event using your Adafruit CLUE, this guide has you covered!
