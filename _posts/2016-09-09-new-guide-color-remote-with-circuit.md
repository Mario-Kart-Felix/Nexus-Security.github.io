New Learn Guide Alert! [John Parkâ€™s Color Remote with Circuit Playground Bluefruit Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/color-remote-with-circuit-playground-bluefruit/overview) shows how to create client and peripheral Bluetooth LE devices with a pair of Circuit Playground Bluefruit boards, and control the RGB NeoPixel LED colors with three slide potentiometers.

> You can build a wireless remote control RGB LED NeoPixel color mixer using two Circuit Playground Bluefruit boards and some slide potentiometers. Using Bluetooth LE, the boards can communicate wirelessly with no need for a computer or mobile phone or tablet!
> 
> Thanks to the Adafruit Bluefruit Connect and BLE libraries in CircuitPython, setup and coding are incredibly simple. You can get started quickly and then extend this code to all sorts of other remote projects!
