A new guide in the Adafruit Learning System: [Commodore 64 – The Most Popular Retro Computer of All Time](https://learn.adafruit.com/commodore-64-retro-guide/overview-and-history)

> Commodore started out manufacturing typewriters and adding machines, then moved on to electronic calculators and eventually computers. In 1976 they purchased MOS Technology, the company that built the 6502 processor, used in the Atari 2600, NES, Apple II, and many more. Part of Commodore’s success was due to the fact that they could manufacture their own chips in-house at MOS.
> 
> The C64 lives on with a huge enthusiast following. People are still writing new software, building new add-ons, and even building modern versions of the 64 with HDMI and Ethernet.
> 
> It’s also well-supported with emulators, so let’s install one and check it out!
