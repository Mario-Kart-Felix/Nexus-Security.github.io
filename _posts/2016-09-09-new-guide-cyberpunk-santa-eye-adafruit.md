Create your own “mad-eyed” Cybernetic Santa Claus eye patch with [this new Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/cyberpunk-santa-eye) by John “Cybersanta” Park! The eye code with robot/terminator style eye animation runs on the Adafruit TFT Gizmo and Circuit Playground Bluefruit or Express.

Some simple crafting with EVA foam sheets make for a stylish, comfortable eye holder.

“Ho-ho-ho. Get to da reindeer!”
