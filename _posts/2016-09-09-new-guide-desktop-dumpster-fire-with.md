Having a bad day? With the press of a button and your small desktop storage container erupts into flames, creating a perfect visual representation of how life often feels, and cathartic way to express oneself.

This [NEW GUIDE](https://learn.adafruit.com/desktop-dumpster-fire) takes you through the basics of this project, which can be easily reprogrammed in MakeCode to take on different functions. A great beginner project, no soldering required!

A servo motor opens the lid of the dumpster and a fan powered by a DC motor blows fake flames upwards. A Circuit Playground Express programmed with MakeCode controls the motors and illumination.
