The [FT232H breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2264) board allows you to add I2C, SPI, and GPIO ports to [almost any PC with a USB port](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-any-computer-with-ft232h). The SPI port capability allows for driving SPI based graphical TFT displays. And by running on a PC, you have plenty of processing power and access to the entire Python ecosystem. This combo allows for some fun use cases.

In this guide we will show you how to use this approach to display real time system status using an FT232H breakout and a small TFT display. It will be your little system status Sidekick.

All coded in [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/).
