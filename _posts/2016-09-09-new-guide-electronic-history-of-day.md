A new guide today in the Adafruit Learning System: [Electronic History of the Day with PyPortal](https://learn.adafruit.com/electronic-history-of-the-day-with-pyportal)

> This PyPortal project shows one notable electronic or science fact every day. Based on what day it is, CircuitPython code grabs JSON data from a database and then prints information about the person associated with that day. Want more info on the person? Use the QR code!
> 
> [We created our very own database with data on the most memorable electronics and sciencey peoples](https://github.com/adafruit/OTD/tree/master/electronics). The CircuitPython code grabs from this database to bring you all these great factoids!
