Check out the latest tutorial from [Erin St. Blaine](https://learn.adafruit.com/users/firepixie): create a series of gorgeous glass bottles with [NeoPixel lights](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3630) inside, and control them all at once using a [Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333). This is a stunningly beautiful project that will turn any room into a magical fairyland. From the guide:

> There’s something magical about fairy lights in bottles. They evoke dreams of endless summer nights: catching fireflies at the bottom of the garden, telling ghost stories by firelight, or cuddling up with a book while a thunderstorm rages outside.
> 
> This project uses a Circuit Playground Express to control nine beautiful, crafty fairy bottles hanging from the branches of an indoor tree sculpture. Capacitive touch metal buttons select color modes based on the four seasons: a relaxing rainbow for summer, flickering candlelight for autumn, raindrops and lighting for winter, and a beautiful energetic and colorful animation for spring.
