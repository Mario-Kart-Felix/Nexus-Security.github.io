You’re a horrible goose. Have fun terrorizing the village with a voice-activated Goose Game costume controller with embedded MONSTER M4SK. This learn guide will show you how to turn an ordinary duck mask into an incredible goose mask! With MONSTER M4SK eyes that bring it to life, and add voice activated USB HID control to the game!

> Have your goose honk in game by honking into your goose mask! The MONSTER M4SK can act as a USB game controller, with a PDM microphone triggering it. This will send a “spacebar” signal to your computer so you can get satisfying HONK! HONK! action!  
> Build the M4SK into a goose mask, with bonus points for costume flippers and wings!
