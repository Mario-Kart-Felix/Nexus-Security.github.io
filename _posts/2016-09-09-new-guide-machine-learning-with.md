A new guide today in the Adafruit Learning System: [Machine Learning with Marshmallows and Tiny Sorter](https://learn.adafruit.com/machine-learning-with-marshmallows-and-tiny-sorter)

> Machine learning is only about as complicated as cereal and marshmallows in this guide.
> 
> [This project from Google](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/tiny-sorter/view) uses a laptop’s built-in camera to identify various cereal and marshmallows. The computer then sorts them based on a model you train. A [Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333) communicates with the computer to decide when to sort which marshmallow/cereal via a micro servo.
