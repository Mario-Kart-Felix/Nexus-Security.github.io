New Guide Alert! John Park’s [MagicLight Bulb Color Mixer with Circuit Playground Bluefruit guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/magiclight-bulb-mixer/overview) shows you how to use a CPB and faders to mix colors on a smart bulb!

> RGB Bluetooth LE light bulbs (a.k.a. “smart bulbs”) for household light sockets are really neat-o, allowing you to create custom lighting effects for your room. Typically, these are controlled with a mobile device app, but we think it’s much more fun to build our own custom remote, and use physical sliders to mix colors!
> 
> Using **CircuitPython**, running on the nRF52840-based **Circuit Playground Bluefruit (CPB)**, makes it all possible. We can send the same commands over Bluetooth LE (BLE) from the CPB as you would normally from your mobile device, the proprietary MagicLight app, and a whole lot more!
> 
> We’ll harness the Circuit Playground Bluefruit board’s buttons, slide switch, on-board NeoPixels, and speaker to act as RGB color value indicators, connection state UI, two-position dimmer switch, and momentary light blinkers!

Plus, the guide includes an introduction to [Understanding BLE](https://learn.adafruit.com/magiclight-bulb-mixer/understanding-ble-characteristics), including GAP, GATT,  peripherals, centrals, servers, clients, services, characteristics and more!
