Check out the latest Learn Guide from Erin St. Blaine: Create an animated, robotic Fizzgig puppet, inspired by Fizzgig from [the Dark Crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Crystal) movie and [Netflix series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Crystal:_Age_of_Resistance). This tutorial uses a [Monster M4sk](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4343) board and a servo to create a barking Fizzgig doll with animated eyes. From the guide:

> Create a growling, barking Fizzgig puppet with a moving mouth and LCD animated eyes. He’s fierce and fancy, with sound effects and movement, and he’s surprisingly easy to build. The Monster M4sk board does all the work.
> 
> Installing software is as easy as copying and pasting a few files. Then, plug in a servo, speaker, and hook up a trigger button, and you’ll be growling at passers-by and protecting all the Gelflings in no time.
> 
> This is a great build to do with kids since most of the work is in building the craft-foam mouth and getting his hair just right. Set him up to guard your Halloween candy bowl, or wear him like a stole. Everyone needs their own animatronic Fizzgig.
