Check out the latest guide by Erin St. Blaine: BlueFruit controllable luminary lanterns for your home. These lanterns are made using a vinyl cutter and have a Circuit Playground BlueFruit inside powering the animations. Control them with your phone or with “buttons” made from copper tape attached to the Circuit Playground’s capacitive touch pads. From the guide:

> Design beautiful customizable luminary lanterns for your home or garden. Cut them out on a vinyl cutter or laser cutter, and fill them with light using a Circuit Playground Bluefruit Express and Adafruit’s NeoPixel rings. Add custom color animations and control the lanterns with Adafruit’s BlueFruit app.
> 
> We’ve also added capacitive touch control, so you can change color modes just by touching the lantern. Circuit Playground Express has all this functionality already built-in, so it’s easier than ever to create gorgeous controllable lights.
> 
> If you’re making just one lantern, this project doesn’t require any soldering at all! The Circuit Playground’s onboard lights will do the work. If you want to make multiple synchronized lanterns, it’s easy to solder NeoPixel rings to the Circuit Playground and string together as many lanterns as you’d like.
