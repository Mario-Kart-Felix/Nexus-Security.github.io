A new guide in the Adafruit Learning System: [Making a PyPortal User Interface with DisplayIO](https://learn.adafruit.com/making-a-pyportal-user-interface-displayio/)

> The PyPortal is the perfect device to interact with internet of things (IoT) projects. Perfect when you need something that’s a bit more than a few buttons on a microcontroller, but a computer or smartphone app would be too much. So you need some sort of simple user interface that can handle buttons, lots of text, icons, and even a few views.

This guide covers a few steps which make it easy to build a small User Interface (UI) in [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/), the easy to use Python implementation for microcontrollers and single board computers (SBC). You may do things like:

*   How to change the display orientation.
*   Using Groups like windows that can be turned on or off.
*   Creating image placeholders that let you easily change the background and icons.
*   Display dynamic text with word wrapping.
*   Create buttons for navigation and in unique windows.
