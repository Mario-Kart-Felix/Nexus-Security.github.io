New Learn Guide: [CircuitPython Animated Sprite Pendants](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-sprite-animation-pendant-mario-clouds-flying-toasters/)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this project we’re making retro inspired wearables! The pendant features an IPS display with animated graphics. It uses Adafruit’s CircuitPython to create animated sprites that look like flying toasters and scrolling clouds.

We originally did these two as Pro Trinket projects, with a monochrome OLED for the toasters, and a color OLED for the clouds. To keep up with modern times, and the new high visibility IPS displays, we’ve upgraded both projects here to use CircuitPython instead of Arduino for easier customization. The displays also look a lot better, but the price and construction is about the same!

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!

The [Adafruit Learning System](http://learn.adafruit.com) has dozens of great tools to get you well on your way to creating incredible works of engineering, interactive art, and design with your 3D printer! If you’ve made a cool project that combines 3D printing and electronics, be sure to let us know, and we’ll [feature](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) it here!
