With this [New Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/meat-skull-centerpiece) by John Park, you can make a horrific-yet-delicious Meat Skull Centerpiece for your next Halloween party! The MONSTER M4SK is our all-in-one, dual-display animated eyeball animation kit that you can easily use to bring this tasty decapitated head to life! The lenses and lens holders make those peepers really pop from their fleshy sockets.

Inspired by [this recipe](https://www.today.com/recipes/zombie-cheese-prosciutto-skull-halloween-party-recipe-t117751) from the Today Show, we decided to up the creepy quotient a bit! Add MONSTER M4SK eyes and sliced prosciutto, capocollo, mortadella, and salami to a plastic-wrap covered foam skull to make a spooky/yummy three dimensional serving platter! Will your house guests be bold enough to peel off a slice of flesh to go with their crackers and beverages?

Included bonus gelatin brain project!
