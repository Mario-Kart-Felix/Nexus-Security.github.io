A new guide in the Adafruit Learning System: [micro:bit Crickit Robot](https://learn.adafruit.com/microbit-crickit-robot/overview)

> This robot is easy to put together and you can program it using the MakeCode block based coding platform so that even the little ones can make robot friends.
> 
> For this build we will be connecting two motors so that the robot can move, a sonar sensor so that the robot can see, and a speaker so that your robot can make noises. The Crickit platform leaves many more things that can be added like other sensors, servos, NeoPixels, and more.
