A new guide in the Adafruit Learning System today: [Monster M4sk Is Watching You](https://learn.adafruit.com/monster-m4sk-is-watching-you/overview)

Use the Adafruit the MONSTER M4SK electronic eyes to **track a person in front of them,** following their face as it moves!

A Panasonic AMG8833 IR Thermal sensor tracks heat and signals the electronic eyes to follow the hottest area, which for a body is you.

Many have asked for a project which used Adafruit eyes with the ability to follow someone, ala a haunted painting, spooky ghoul, etc. This is the guide you’ve been waiting for.
