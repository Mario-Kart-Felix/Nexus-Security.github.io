New Guide just in time for the holidays: [John Park’s Snow Globe with Circuit Playground Bluefruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/snow-globe-bluefruit-cpb)!

> You can make your own fun, custom snow globe for the holidays, or any time of year! Using a Circuit Playground Bluetooth running CircuitPython, the built in accelerometer will detect shaking and launch a little local light show.
> 
> Multiple animated sequences can be selected from within the Adafruit Bluefruit App for iOS and Android, allowing you to adjust the show from your mobile device.
