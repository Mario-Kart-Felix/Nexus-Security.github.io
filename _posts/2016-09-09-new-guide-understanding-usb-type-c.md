A new guide today in the Adafruit Learning System: [Understanding USB Type C: Cable Types, Pitfalls and More.](https://learn.adafruit.com/understanding-usb-type-c-cable-types-pitfalls-and-more)

> “USB” or [Universal Serial Bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB) is a standard that was created as a means to make connectors more universal and transparent. USB C is a **specific shape of USB connector** and was designed to take that universality a step further by being the one connector for almost anything including data, power/charging, video and audio. The connector is also reversible, it has no up or down orientation!
> 
> While USB C does make some things a lot easier, there is also lots of confusion and uncertainty surrounding it. Are all USB C cables the same? (No). What can USB C do that older USB cable types can’t? (A lot more but it also depends on the cable). Can a USB C cable damage hardware? (Potentially). USB C can be tricky but much of the confusion is hopefully cleared up in the following pages.

Plus check out this neat graphic we made detailing USB C specs:
