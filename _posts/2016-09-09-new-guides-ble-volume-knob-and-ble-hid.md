Two new guides for all your wireless Bluetooth LE HID control needs! Weâ€™ve got BLE HID in CircuitPython, so you can pair and bond any of our nRF52840 boards with a mobile device or computer, and then send keycodes (like typing keys through the air!) and consumer control codes (volume! mute! play/pause!!).

The first guide is [BLE Volume Knob with CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluetooth-le-hid-volume-knob-with-circuitpython/overview), which uses a rotary push encoder and Circuit Playground Bluefruit to be your remote volume controller, including NeoPixel LED indicator ring.

The second guide is [BLE HID Keyboard Buttons with CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/ble-hid-keyboard-buttons-with-circuitpython/overview) which is a great launching point for any kind of remote key entry project. This one uses the Feather nRF52840 and five buttons. You can easily configure the code in CircuitPython to send any keycode, key combo, or even whole words and sentences at the push of a wireless button.
