---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project uses the Adafruit Feather platform and CircuitPython to make an easy to control motorized camera slider. The build uses aluminum extrusion to support a linear rail system with 3D printed parts. A camera can be mounted to the platform and slide along the rail. You may use the joystick and buttons to trigger different time settings presented on a mini TFT display.

**FeatherWings**

The mini TFT FeatherWing is perfect for selecting settings and displaying modes! The MotorWing provides the Feather M4 with stepper motor control and makes it easy to connect. A Tripler FeatherWing keeps everything in place and makes it modular.

**Features**

The program features four timing presets to select from using the joystick and switch. 5-min, 10-min, 20-min and 60-min. The status of the slider is displayed while it’s in  
motion. Time remaining is also displayed alongside a nifty graphic and icon. When the slide is approaching the end, a STOP graphic is presented.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!

The [Adafruit Learning System](http://learn.adafruit.com) has dozens of great tools to get you well on your way to creating incredible works of engineering, interactive art, and design with your 3D printer! If you’ve made a cool project that combines 3D printing and electronics, be sure to let us know, and we’ll [feature](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) it here!
