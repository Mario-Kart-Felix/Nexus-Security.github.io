Normally when we give you a New Part Day piece, it concerns a component that you will have never seen before. The subject of this find by \[Robert Fitzsimons\] then is a slight departure from that norm, given that the [SK6812 Mini-E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLYkzn0jwg8) is a WS2812 or Neopixel compatible multi-colour LED of a type that has been available for a while now.

What makes this component new though is its packaging. The Mini-E variant of the SK6812 only appeared last year and has now found its way through to smaller order quantities on AliExpress. Its special feature is that it has a set of flat leads rather than the usual pads on the underside of the package. This means that unlike its predecessors it is readily hand solderable, as he demonstrates by attaching a set of leads to one.

The leads emerge halfway up the side of the device, which seems designed to be mounted recessed within a PCB hole. He demonstrates this with a piece of stripboard, and remarks that they would make a good choice for many small projects such as Shitty Add-On boards.

Weâ€™ve touched the leadless SK6812s a few times before, along the way remarking that [in some respects they are better than the WS2812 they follow](https://hackaday.com/2017/01/25/ws2812b-led-clones-work-better-than-originals/).
