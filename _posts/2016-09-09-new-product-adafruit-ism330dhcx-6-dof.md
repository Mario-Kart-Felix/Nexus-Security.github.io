### NEW PRODUCT – [Adafruit ISM330DHCX – 6 DoF IMU – Accelerometer and Gyroscope – STEMMA QT / Qwiic](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4502)

* * *

Behold, the ST ISM330DHCX: an _industrial quality_ Accelerometer+Gyroscope 6-DOF IMUs (inertial measurement unit) from ST.

This IMU sensor has 6 degrees of freedom – 3 degrees each of linear acceleration and angular velocity at varying rates within a respectable range. For the accelerometer: **±2/±4/±8/±16 g** at 1.6 Hz to 6.7KHz update rate. For the gyroscope: **±125/±250/±500/±1000/±2000/±4000 dps** at 12.5 Hz to 6.7 KHz. In particular, this is one of the few gyro’s we stock with 4000 dps range, usually they top out at 2000. This sensor has extra calibration and compensation circuits to give it excellent performance in a wide environmental range from -40 to +105°C. Most other IMU sensors don’t have industrial temperature ranges, or have wide accuracy variation as the temperature changes. The accelerometer and gyroscope also are on the same silicon die, which will keep the 6 measurements synchronized better than when the two sensors are on separate dies.

There are also some nice extras, such as built in tap detection, activity detection, pedometer/step counter and a programmable finite state machine / machine learning core that can perform some basic gesture recognition.

For interfacing, you can use either SPI or I2C – there’s two configurable interrupt pins. For advanced usage, you can attach additional devices to an external I2C/SPI port – used for optical image stabilization.

To make getting started fast and easy, we placed the sensors on compact breakout boards with voltage regulation and level-shifted inputs. That way you can use them with 3V or 5V power/logic devices without worry.

[We also wrote libraries to help you get these sensors integrated with your Arduino/C++ or CircuitPython/Python boards such as Raspberry Pi or other single board computers.](https://learn.adafruit.com/lsm6dsox-and-ism330dhc-6-dof-imu)

Additionally since it speaks I2C you can easily connect it up with two wires (plus power and ground!).  We’ve even included [SparkFun qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) compatible [**STEMMA QT**](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt) connectors for the I2C bus so **you don’t even need to solder!** [Just wire up to your favorite micro like the STM32F405 Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4382) with a plug-and-play cable to get 6 DoF data ASAP.
