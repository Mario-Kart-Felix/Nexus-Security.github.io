### NEW PRODUCT – [Anti-Static ESD Rework Mat with Grounding Clip – A4 Size – 20cm x 30cm](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4405)

* * *

This anti-static work mat is great for electronic work and repair, especially delicate or ESD sensitive work. It’s 2mm thick and has a very high-resistance covering, like 10’s of Megaohms. There’s a clip attached that you need to connect to an earth ground in order to ground the mat. Usually, folks connect it to a known-grounded metal chassis.

While this mat is somewhat heat-resistant it is not as resistant as our silicone mats, so it can take some abuse, but we don’t recommend hot-airing without a PCB holder. It’s resistant to corrosion, glues, and other adhesives, and it can be cleaned with some water – don’t scrub _too hard_ or you can remove the anti-stat coating.

If you want to test the coating, you will not be able to use a multimeter in resistance mode, they’re not sensitive enough! Instead, connect your multimeter, in microAmpere mode, in-line with a ~12V power supply. You should see a few microAmps of current pass through the mat.

This mat is 30 cm wide, 20 cm tall and 2mm thick and comes with a grounding clip installed. Your order comes with one mat.

**_Solder, soldering iron, and other components are not included._**
