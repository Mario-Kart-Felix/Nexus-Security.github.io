### NEW PRODUCT – [Google Coral Development Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4385)

* * *

The Coral Dev Board is a single-board computer that’s ideal when you need to perform fast machine learning (ML) inferencing in a small form factor. You can use the Dev Board to prototype your embedded system and then scale to production using the on-board [Coral System-on-Module](https://coral.withgoogle.com/products/som/) (SoM) combined with your custom PCB hardware.

The SoM provides a fully-integrated system, including NXP’s iMX8M system-on-chip (SoC), eMMC memory, LPDDR4 RAM, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, but its unique power comes from Google’s Edge TPU coprocessor. The Edge TPU is a small ASIC designed by Google that provides high performance ML inferencing with a low power cost. For example, it can execute state-of-the-art mobile vision models such as MobileNet v2 at 400 FPS, in a power efficient manner.

The baseboard provides all the peripheral connections you need to prototype a project, including USB 2.0/3.0 ports, DSI display interface, CSI-2 camera interface, Ethernet port, speaker terminals, and a 40-pin I/O header.

[We have support for the Coral board in Adafruit Blinka so you can use a ton of our CircuitPython libraries directly from this board for easy hardware interfacing.](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-google-coral-linux-blinka)

[A 5V 3A USB C power supply is recommended for powering this dev board beast.](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4298)

Key benefits of the Dev Board:

*   High-speed and low-power ML inferencing (4 TOPS @2W)
*   A complete Linux system (running Mendel, a Debian derivative)
*   Prototyping and evaluation board for the small Coral SoM (40 x 48 mm)
