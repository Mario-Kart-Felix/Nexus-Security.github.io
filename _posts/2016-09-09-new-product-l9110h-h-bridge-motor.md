### NEW PRODUCT – [L9110H H-Bridge Motor Driver for DC Motors – 8 DIP – 2.5V-12V 800mAh](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4489)

* * *

Run two solenoids, or a single DC motor with up to 800mA per channel using the super-simple L9110H H-bridge driver. This bridge chip is an 8 DIP package so it’s easy to fit onto any breadboard or perfboard.

Each chip contains one full H-bridges (two half H-bridges). That means you can drive 2 solenoids or a single DC motors bi-directionally. Just make sure they’re good for under 800 mA since that’s the limit of this chip. They do handle a peak of 1.5A but that’s just for a short amount of time. What we like most about this particular driver is that it **comes with built in kick-back diodes internally so you don’t have to worry about the inductive kick damaging your project or driver!**

There’s a PWM input per driver so you can control motor speed and direction. Good for motor power voltages from 2.5V up to 12V! This chip doesn’t have split logic/power pins, but it seems that you can use 3.3V logic level with higher voltages no problem – we controlled a 9V motor setup with a Feather running at 3.3V.
