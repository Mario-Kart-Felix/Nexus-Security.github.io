### NEW PRODUCT – [Solder Wick – 0.8mm wide and 1.5m / 5 feet long](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4456)

* * *

Used along with the solder sucker to clean up soldering messes. Wick really comes in handy when soldering or desoldering surface-mount parts. Even if you don’t have the best iron for SMT work, a bit of wick will fix it up.

This is thinner, SMT-friendly 0.8mm wick, and 1.5m long, so you have plenty to work with.

[We also carry solder wick with 1.5mm width](http://www.adafruit.com/products/149) _(try saying that 5x fast!)_
