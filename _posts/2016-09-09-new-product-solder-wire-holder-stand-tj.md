### NEW PRODUCT – [Solder Wire Holder Stand – TJ-227](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4406)

* * *

This portable, minimalist solder wire stand is so handy, we had to carry it in the shop. It comes as a solid metal frame that’s not too heavy and (best of all) a solder roll holder that keeps your wire from getting tangled! The roll holder can support up to 1kg of solder wire.

**Doesn’t include a soldering iron or solder!** We also carry a [solder stand that holds both your iron and solder roll.](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1154)
