### NEW PRODUCT – [Sony Spresense Pack – Main Board + Extension Board + Camera](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4420)

* * *

**SPRESENSE** is a low-power board computer for the IoT that is equipped with a GPS receiver and supports High-Resolution Audio codecs. The board allows for IoT versatility and can be developed for a vast range of uses, such as a drone utilizing the GPS and high-performance processor, a smart speaker utilizing High-Resolution Audio recording and playback as well as the built-in full-digital amplifier, or a low-power time-lapse camera utilizing the camera interface. SPRESENSE will make the IoT smarter and more efficient.

Instead of hemming and hawing which IoT boards to pick for your project, we’re offering an easy all-in-one pack!

Includes:

*   [Sony Spresense Main Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4419) – Sony’s CXD5602 microcontroller runs 6 ARM Cortex-M4F cores with a clock speed of up to 156MHz and has an integrated GPS. Thanks to the FD-SOI (Fully Depleted Silicon On Insulator) production process, the CXD5602 chip is very power efficient which enables battery-dependent use cases.
*   [Sony Spresense Extension Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4418) – allows developers to create IoT applications in a very short time and is supported by the Arduino IDE as well as the more advanced NuttX based SDK
*   [Sony Spresense 5MP Camera Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4417) – Sony ISX012 has an effective pixel count of 5.11M pixels and an onboard encoder that can acquire pictures in JPEG, RAW, Y/C or RGB format.

You’ll need a power supply, and/or micro USB cable for programming.

Let’s dive in a little deeper. First up, the main board!

Here’s a compact development board based on Sony’s power-efficient multicore microcontroller CXD5602. It allows developers to create applications in a very short time and is supported by the Arduino IDE as well as the more advanced NuttX based SDK.

*   **Integrated GPS** – The embedded GNSS with support for GPS, QZSS and GLONASS enables applications where tracking is required.
*   **Hi-res audio output and multi mic input**s – Advanced 192kHz/24 bit audio codec and amplifier for audio output, and support for up to 8 mic input channels.
*   **Multicore microcontroller** – Spresense is powered by Sony’s CXD5602 microcontroller (ARM® Cortex®-M4F × 6 cores), with a clock speed of 156 MHz.

Despite its compact footprint of only 6.5 x 6.5mm, Sony’s CXD5602 microcontroller runs 6 ARM Cortex-M4F cores with a clock speed of up to 156MHz and has an integrated GPS. Thanks to the FD-SOI (Fully Depleted Silicon On Insulator) production process, the CXD5602 chip is very power efficient which enables battery-dependent use cases.
