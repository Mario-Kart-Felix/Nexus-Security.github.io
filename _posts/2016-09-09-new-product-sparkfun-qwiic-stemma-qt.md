### NEW PRODUCT – [SparkFun Qwiic / Stemma QT FeatherWing (Shield for Thing Plus)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4515)

* * *

The **SparkFun Qwiic FeatherWing (Shield for Thing Plus)** provides an easy-to-assemble way to add the [**STEMMA QT**](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt) / [Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) connect ecosystem to any development board with Feather/Thing Plus Footprint. It connects the I2C bus (GND, 3.3V, SDA, and SCL) on your Feather to four SparkFun Qwiic / Stemma QT connectors. The plug-n-play ecosystem allows for easy daisy chaining so, as long as your devices are on different addresses, you can connect as many Qwiic & Stemma QT devices as you’d like.

This jumper is a little different than normal I2C pull up jumpers as it is open by default. The jumper only needs to be closed if your I2C  device does not have pull up resistors.  All Adafruit I2C Stemma QT breakouts come with pull up resistors on them so if you are using a Qwiic or Stemma QT I2C device from Sparkfun or Adafruit, you don’t need to close the jumper pads.

All that is needed to get started is to solder your chosen headers to the PCB and, if necessary, to your Feather board. Take care to match the markings on the Qwiic Shield to the appropriate pins on your Feather to avoid shorting anything out and possibly damaging your boards.
