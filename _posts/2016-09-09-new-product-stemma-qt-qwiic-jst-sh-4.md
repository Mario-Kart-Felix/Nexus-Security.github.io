### NEW PRODUCT – [STEMMA QT / Qwiic JST SH 4-pin Cable with Premium Female Sockets – 150mm Long](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4397)

* * *

This 4-wire cable is a little over 150mm / 6″ long and fitted with JST-SH female 4-pin connectors on one end and premium female headers on the other. Compared with the chunkier JST-PH these are 1mm pitch instead of 2mm, but still have a nice latching feel, while being easy to insert and remove.
