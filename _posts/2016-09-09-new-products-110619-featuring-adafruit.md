[Adafruit EdgeBadge – TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4400): Machine learning has come to the ‘edge’ – small microcontrollers that can run a very miniature version of TensorFlow Lite to do ML computations.

But you don’t need super complex hardware to start developing your own TensorFlow models! We’ve adapted our popular PyBadge board to add a microphone so you can dip your toes into machine learning waters. It does everything that the PyBadge does, and as we make more projects that use Machine Learning we’ll adapt this board to make it better and better for machine learning.

[EVA Foam Pack in Rainbow Colors – 2mm thick – 10 sheets](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4349): EVA foam is one of the best and easiest go-to materials for constructing costumes and props. It’s light, inexpensive, versatile, and can easily be cut and heat-shaped for a snug fit. With enough time, patience, and the right tools, EVA foam can be finished to look like nearly any material. Use to create costume armor, headpieces, prop weapons, and other accessories.

[Adafruit MPU-6050 6-DoF Accel and Gyro Sensor – STEMMA QT Qwiic](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3886): I mew, you mew we all mew for IMU! The MPU-6050 is what we call “an oldie but goodie” – this popular triple axis accelerometer plus gyro combo has been a staple of electronic projects for years, and we’ve finally gotten around to making a breakout for it!

Inside are two sensors, one is a classic 3-axis accelerometer, which can tell you which direction is down towards the Earth (by measuring gravity). The other is a gyroscoe that can sense how fast the board is being twisted around. By combining this data you can tell how your project is moving through space

[Adafruit LSM303AGR Accelerometer Magnetometer – STEMMA QT Qwiic](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4413): Do you know which way the wind blows? You will now, with this triple-axis accelerometer/magnetometer compass module. Inside are two sensors, one is a classic 3-axis accelerometer, which can tell you which direction is down towards the Earth (by measuring gravity). The other is a magnetometer that can sense where the strongest magnetic force is coming from, generally used to detect magnetic north. By combining this data you can then orient your project!

[Adafruit Mini GPS PA1010D – UART and I2C – STEMMA QT](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4415): This miniature GPS breakout is only 1″ x 1″ (~ 25mm x 25mm) but houses a complete GPS/GNSS solution with both I2C and UART interfaces. There’s even an antenna on top so it’s plug and play!
