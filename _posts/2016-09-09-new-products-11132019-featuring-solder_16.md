[STEMMA QT / Qwiic JST SH 4-pin Cable with Premium Female Sockets – 150mm Long](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4397)

This 4-wire cable is a little over 150mm / 6″ long and fitted with JST-SH female 4-pin connectors on one end and premium female headers on the other. Compared with the chunkier JST-PH these are 1mm pitch instead of 2mm, but still have a nice latching feel, while being easy to insert and remove.

[Solder Wire Holder Stand – TJ-227](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4406)  
This portable, minimalist solder wire stand is so handy, we had to carry it in the shop. It comes as a solid metal frame that’s not too heavy and (best of all) a solder roll holder that keeps your wire from getting tangled! The roll holder can support up to 1kg of solder wire.
