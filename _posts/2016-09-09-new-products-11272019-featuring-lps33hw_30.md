[Adafruit LPS33HW Water Resistant Pressure Sensor – STEMMA QT](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4414): Sometimes you need to sense pressure in a damp or caustic environment. And sometimes you need to know the relative changes in pressure as well as the absolute pressure. For the times you need to do both (or either), the LPS33HW is the pressure sensor for you. Combining protection from water intrusion with support for high precision relative and absolute measurements, this sensor will do what you need. With drivers for CircuitPython, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi, and support for I2C or SPI (Arduino only SPI support, for now) you’ll be measuring pressure in any situation in no time.
