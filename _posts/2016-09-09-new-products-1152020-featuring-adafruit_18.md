[![4448 01](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/I4448-01.jpg "4448-01.jpg")](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4448)  
[USB Type A Plug Breakout Cable with Premium Female Jumpers – 30cm long](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4448): If you’d like to connect a USB-capable chip to your USB host, this cable will make the task very simple. There is no converter chip in this cable! Its basically a plain USB cable that’s cut in half and with jumper sockets on the power and data lines. Simple to use, does the job when you have something that exposes the D+/D- pins.

[![4449 02](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/I4449-02.jpg "4449-02.jpg")](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4449)

[USB Type A Jack Breakout Cable with Premium Female Jumpers – 30cm long](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4449): If you’d like to connect a USB-host-capable chip to your USB peripheral, this cable will make the task very simple. There is no converter chip in this cable! It’s basically a plain USB cable that’s cut in half and with jumper sockets on the power and data lines. Simple to use, does the job when you have something that exposes the D+/D- pins.

[![4437 05](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/I4437-05.jpg "4437-05.jpg")](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4437)[DIN Rail 2×20 IDC to Terminal Block Adapter Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4437): This one’s going out to all the makers and designers who use DIN railing in their builds. This adapter plate is perfect for simplifying complex wiring. You connect a 2×20 IDC cable to this very PCB, which can be DIN rail-mounted. Then, all 40 pins are broken out into terminal blocks, so you can connect and power your sensors, displays, microcontrollers, etc.

[![4430 00](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/I4430-00.jpg "4430-00.jpg")](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4430)[High Current Inductive Charge Kit – 5V @ 1.3A max](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4430): Inductive charging is a way of powering a device without a direct wire connection. Most people have seen inductive charging in a rechargeable electric toothbrush: you may have noticed that you recharge it by placing it into the holder, but there’s no direct plug. These chargers work by taking a power transformer and splitting it in half, an AC waveform is generated into one, and couples into the second coil.

[![4424 02](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/I4424-02.jpg "4424-02.jpg")](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4424)  
[4-pin JST PH to JST SH Cable – STEMMA / Grove to QT / Qwiic – 200mm long](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4424): Are you a maker in the midst of a [STEMMA](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/what-is-stemma) dilemma? This 200mm long 4-wire cable is a fantastic chimera-cable fitted with STEMMA QT / Sparkfun Qwiic JST SH on one end, and Grove / STEMMA JST PH connectors on the other.

Chunkier JST PH connectors come with 2mm pitch, and JST SH (also known as Qwiic) are 1mm pitch. Both have a nice latching feel, while being easy to insert and remove. Great for use with PyPortal, PyBadge, PyGamer, HalloWings, and anything else we made with a 4-pin JST PH connector for I2C.

[![4396 03](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/I4396-03.jpg "4396-03.jpg")](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4396)  
[USB Type C Socket – SMT Inline Breakout Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4396): This USB Type C breakout is kinda interesting, it looks similar to our right angle USB C socket breakout, but it’s an ‘inline’ style with pads for soldering to the connections. We think it could be handy for making custom cable harnesses! Unlike our breakout, it also has the true dual-row USB C connector and all pads broken out. It does not have any resistors to set direction/current – required to have USB C enumerate. It’s really just a connector breakout. That said, it could be handy for inline connections that need a range of pin connections

[![4485 00](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/I4485-00.jpg "4485-00.jpg")](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4485)  
[Adafruit LSM6DS33 + LIS3MDL – 9 DoF IMU with Accel / Gyro / Mag – STEMMA QT Qwiic](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4485): Add motion, direction and orientation sensing to your Arduino project with this all-in-one 9 Degree of Freedom (9-DoF) sensor with sensors from ST. This little breakout contains two chips that sit side-by-side to provide 9 degrees of full motion data.

The board includes an LSM6DS33, a 6-DoF IMU accelerometer + gyro. The 3-axis accelerometer, can tell you which direction is down towards the Earth (by measuring gravity) or how fast the board is accelerating in 3D space. The 3-axis gyroscope that can measure spin and twist. The three triple-axis sensors add up to 9 degrees of freedom.

[![4479 00](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/I4479-00.jpg "4479-00.jpg")](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4479)  
[Adafruit Triple-axis Magnetometer – LIS3MDL – STEMMA QT / Qwiic](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4479): Sense the magnetic fields that surround us with this handy triple-axis magnetometer (compass) module. Magnetometers can sense where the strongest magnetic force is coming from, generally used to detect magnetic north, but can also be used for measuring magnetic fields. This sensor tends to be paired with a 6-DoF (degree of freedom) accelerometer/gyroscope to create a 9-DoF inertial measurement unit that can detect its orientation in real-space thanks to Earth’s stable magnetic field. It’s a great match for the LSM6DSOX from ST!

The board includes an LSM6DS33, a 6-DoF IMU accelerometer + gyro. The 3-axis accelerometer, can tell you which direction is down towards the Earth (by measuring gravity) or how fast the board is accelerating in 3D space. The 3-axis gyroscope that can measure spin and twist. This chip isn’t the newest motion sensor, but it is well-established and comes at a great price.
