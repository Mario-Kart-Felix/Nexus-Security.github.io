[STEMMA Wired Tactile Push-Button Pack – 5 Color Pack](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4431)

Little clicky switches are standard input “buttons” on electronic projects. These are just like our Colorful Round Tactile Button Switch Assortment, but already assembled onto a PCB – they even have a pull-up resistor installed! The pins are normally open (disconnected) and when the button is pressed they are momentarily closed.

[Geared DC Motor with Magnetic Encoder Outputs – 7 VDC 1:20 Ratio](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4416)

The first step in a robotics project is to get a motor spinning. Once you’ve done that you quickly learn that not all motors go the same speed, even if they are the same part number! There are always variations that relate to voltage, environment, and manufacturing changes. So, the second step is to figure out how fast its going! Turns out that’s not so easy, but the best way to get started is to add an encoder wheel and an optical or magnetic counter. As the motor turns, the attached encoder wheel spins, causing the counter to detect each passing spoke and that lets your microcontroller count and determine speed.

[Adafruit eInk Feather Friend with 32KB SRAM](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4446)

Easy e-paper finally comes to your Feather with this Adafruit EInk Feather Friend that’s designed to make it a breeze to add an eInk display. Chances are you’ve seen one of those new-fangled ‘e-readers’ like the Kindle or Nook. They have gigantic electronic paper ‘static’ displays – that means the image stays on the display even when power is completely disconnected. The image is also high contrast and very daylight readable. It really does look just like printed paper!
