[HackSpace Magazine Issue #25 – Maker Christmas – December 2019](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4501)

This issue is bootloaded (ok, forgive us) with tons of DIY tutorials (how to make beautiful, weird sounds with a NeoTrellis, linking your phone to your CircuitPython-running microcontroller to send data and commands, recreating the candle with Arduino and NeoPixels), an interview with Sam Underwood on why making, music, and why function comes before form, and more!

[Adafruit Circuit Playground Bluefruit + TFT Gizmo Project Pack](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4504)

If you missed out on ADABOX 014, its not too late for you to pick up the parts necessary to build many of the projects! This kit pack doesn’t come with tissue paper or the nifty extras, but it does have all the electronic goodies you need

This project pack features the Circuit Playground Bluefruit with Bluetooth LE support so now we can make our projects wireless! We’ve also included a colorful ‘TFT Gizmo’ graphical display, a rechargeable battery and USB charger, as well as a few cases and enclosures to help you craft a beautiful holiday decoration.

[NeoPixel Addressable 1515 LEDs (1.5mm x 1.5mm) – 10 pack – SK6805-E-J](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4492)

Make your own smart LED arrangement with the same integrated LED that is used in our NeoPixel strip and pixels. This tiny 1515 (1.5mm x 1.5mm) RGB LED is designed to be surface-mount soldered and is the most compact way possible to integrate multiple bright LEDs to a design. The driver chip is inside the LED and has ~18mA constant current drive so the color will be very consistent even if the voltage varies, and no external choke resistors are required making your design minimal. Power the whole thing with 5VDC, and you’re ready to rock.

[Adafruit DPS310 Precision Barometric Pressure / Altitude Sensor – STEMMA QT / Qwiic](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4494)

How high are you right now? If you had a precision altitude sensor, you would know for sure! The DPS310 sensor from Infineon a high precision barometric sensor, perfect for measuring altitude changes with a up to ±0.002 hPa (or ±0.02 m) precision high precision mode and ± 1 hPa absolute accuracy. That means you can know your absolute altitude with 1 meter accuracy when you set the sea-level pressure, and measure changes in altitude with up to 2 cm precision. This makes it a great sensor for use in drones or other altitude-sensitive robots. This sensor would also do well in any environmental sensing kit, you can use it to predict weather system changes

[Adafruit ISM330DHCX – 6 DoF IMU – Accelerometer and Gyroscope – STEMMA QT / Qwiic](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4502)

Behold, the ST ISM330DHCX: an industrial quality Accelerometer+Gyroscope 6-DOF IMUs (inertial measurement unit) from ST.

This IMU sensor has 6 degrees of freedom – 3 degrees each of linear acceleration and angular velocity at varying rates within a respectable range. For the accelerometer: ±2/±4/±8/±16 g at 1.6 Hz to 6.7KHz update rate. For the gyroscope: ±125/±250/±500/±1000/±2000/±4000 dps at 12.5 Hz to 6.7 KHz. In particular, this is one of the few gyro’s we stock with 4000 dps range, usually they top out at 2000. This sensor has extra calibration and compensation circuits to give it excellent performance in a wide environmental range from -40 to +105°C. Most other IMU sensors don’t have industrial temperature ranges, or have wide accuracy variation as the temperature changes. The accelerometer and gyroscope also are on the same silicon die, which will keep the 6 measurements synchronized better than when the two sensors are on separate dies.
