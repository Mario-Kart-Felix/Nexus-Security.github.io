[USB Type A to Type C Cable – approx 1 meter / 3 ft long](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4474)  
As technology changes and adapts, so does Adafruit. This **USB Type A to Type C** cable will help you with the transition to USB C, even if you’re still totin’ around a USB Type A hub, computer or laptop.

[![4473 02](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/I4473-02.jpg "4473-02.jpg")](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4473)  
[USB Type A to Type C Cable – 1ft – 0.3 meter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4473)  
USB C is the latest industry-standard connector for transmitting data and power. Like Lightning and MagSafe cables, USB C has no up or down orientation. And who among us has inserted USB correctly the first time? Works great with any computer that has a classic USB type A (rectangular) port, and will let you attach to any devices with new-fangled type C connector (rounded rectangle).

[![4472 00](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/I4472-00.jpg "4472-00.jpg")](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4472)  
[USB Type A to Type C Cable – 6″ long](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4472)

These cables don’t magically give you USB C speeds if you are using a USB 2.x port, and they won’t give you the power negotiation stuff because your computer doesn’t have that built in. The cable has built in resistors to force it to 5V power, so it’s strictly for devices that use 5V and up to ~2A.

[![4466 04](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/I4466-04.jpg "4466-04.jpg")](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4466)  
[Octagon Chassis Frame – Blue Plastic – 16cm x 16cm x 4cm](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4466)

This Blue Octagon Chassis makes for an excellent robot body that’s easy to machine and modify. It’s a single piece of 4mm thick plastic, with a variety of holes, slots and cutouts for mounting boards, sensors, and servos. The sides are notched to fit two DC Gear ‘TT’ motors – you’ll want to get four M3 or 4-40 screws about 24mm/1.0″ long to mount the motors. At either end you can screw on a ball caster. You can build a very sturdy (and quite handsome!) medium-sized robot rover with this frame.

[![4496 04](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/I4496-04.jpg "4496-04.jpg")](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4496)  
[Feather Click Shield by MikroElektronika](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4496)

MikroElektronika’s Feather Click Shield will expand your Feather projects to “fly” with more than 750 Click boards available from MikroE. This coterie of Click boards gives you a versatile selection of peripheral devices that can be taken off the shelf and used for prototyping in no time. The shield is designed with two proprietary mikroBUS sockets, allowing all the Click board devices to be interfaced with the Feather boards. It is enough to place an add-on board of your choice on the top of the mikroBUS socket – and click it in. Hence why this add-on board is called Click board – it just clicks!

[![4493 02](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/I4493-02.jpg "4493-02.jpg")](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4493)[STEMMA Wired Potentiometer Breakout Board – 10K ohm Linear](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4493)

For the easiest way possible to measure twists, turn to this STEMMA potentiometer breakout (ha!). This plug-n-play pot comes with a JST-PH 2mm connector and a matching JST PH 3-Pin to Male Header Cables – 200mm, so wiring up is a cinch. Simply plug the cable in, then use the black wire to connect to your ground, white wire to the input/signal pin and the red wire to your power pin. The power pin voltage should match the voltage max of your analog input. So, if you’re using a 5V Arduino or compatible, connect red to 5V. If you’re using a 3V Feather board, tie red to 3V.

[![4468 00](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/I4468-00.jpg "4468-00.jpg")](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4468)[Miniature 5V Cooling Fan with Molex PicoBlade Connector](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4468)

Looking for another way to keep your project cool? Hook up this 5V Mini Cooling Fan and prevent from overheating! Of course, it’s also great for use with any small computer or FPGA or motor driver or anything that needs cooling.

We also carry a mini 5V cooling fan with [regular JST 2-pin connectors](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3368). This fan is nearly identical – it has the same fan body, but the cable has a handy “Molex PicoBlade” 1.25mm pitch 2-pin cable, which makes plugging into a board easy. Or you can cut off the connector and just solder/clamp onto the wires directly.

[![4500 09](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2020/01/I4500-09.jpg "4500-09.jpg")](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4500)  
[Adafruit CLUE – nRF52840 Express with Bluetooth LE – ALPHA](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4500)

Do you feel like you just don’t have a CLUE? Well, we can help with that – get a CLUE here at Adafruit by picking up this sensor-packed development board. We wanted to build some projects that have a small screen and a lot of sensors. To make it compatible with existing projects, we made it the same shape and size as the BBC micro:bit and with the same edge-connector on the bottom with 5 big pads so it will fit into your existing robot kit or ‘bit add-on. This is the alpha release of the hardware.

This is the alpha release of the hardware, everything works, but we may change around the sensors or pinouts as we add projects and support for the CLUE! We’ve also set the price at an introductory $29.95 during the ALPHA, the price will be $39.95 after the alpha is over.
