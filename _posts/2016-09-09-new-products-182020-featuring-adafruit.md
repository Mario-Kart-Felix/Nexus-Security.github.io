[Adafruit CLUE – nRF52840 Express with Bluetooth LE](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4500): Coming soon…sign up to be notified when we fabricate the first batch!

We wanted to build some projects that have a small screen and a lot of sensors. This board has a 1.3″ 240×240 IPS TFT display, two buttons, and a ton of sensors:

*   LSM series 9-DoF motion – LSM6DS33 Accel/Gyro + LIS3MDL magnetometer
*   APDS9960 Proximity, Light, RGB, and Gesture Sensor
*   PDM Microphone sound sensor
*   Humidity, temperature and barometric environmental sensing

[OpenMV Cam H7 – MicroPython Embedded Vision + Machine Learning](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4478): The OpenMV Cam is like a super powerful microcontroller board with a camera on board that you program in MicroPython. It’s easy to run machine visions algorithms on what the OpenMV Cam sees so you can track colors, detect faces, and more in seconds, and thanks to the embedded functionality, you can then control I/O pins in the real-world.

[Adafruit MCP4728 Quad DAC with EEPROM – STEMMA QT / Qwiic](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4470): Coming Soon! If you’ve ever said to yourself, “Gee, I wish I had four 12-bit DACs that came in a single package with the ability to save their settings to an EEPROM”, well I have good news. The MCP4728 is the answer to your wishes! Within its little package, the MCP4728 has four 12-bit DACs for whatever voltage setting needs you may have. In addition, it has the ability to store the settings for the DACs to an internal EEPROM. Once saved to the internal non-volatile memory, the settings will be loaded by default when the DAC powers up. All over I2C!

[Premium Silicone Covered Female-Female Jumper Wires – 200mm x 40](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4447): These premium female-female jumper wires are handy for making wire harnesses or jumpering between headers on PCBs. They’re 200mm (~7.8″) long and come loose as a pack of 40 (10 pieces of red, blue, yellow, and Adafruit black). They have 0.1″ female header contacts on either end and fit cleanly next to each other on standard-pitch 0.1″ (2.54mm) header.

These jumper wires are a little more expensive than most because they use silicone covered wires, they’re a little more durable and they’re more heat-resistant than standard PVC covered wires.

[DIN Rail 2×8 IDC to Terminal Block Adapter Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4436): This one’s going out to all the makers and designers who use DIN railing in their builds. This adapter plate is perfect for simplifying complex wiring. You connect a 2×8 IDC cable to this very PCB, which can be DIN rail-mounted. Then, all 16 pins are broken out into terminal blocks, so you can connect and power your sensors, displays, microcontrollers, etc.

[DIN Rail Generic PCB Holder – 50x80mm](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4435): It’s pretty simple, so not much to say about it. You have a DIN railing, you want to attach something to it? Maybe it fits in a 50mm x 80mm rectangle? This will do the job. Its easy to assemble in a minute or less. To install onto a DIN rail, attach the yellow plastic lock to the bottom of the holder and snap in once you have it positioned how you like. The plastic casing is easy to machine, drill or cut.

[RJ12 Jack Connectors – EV3/NXT LEGO Compatible – Pack of 10](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4434): If you have any LEGO Mindstorm or EV3 sensors/motors/controllers you probably noticed the phone-cable-like connectors that are used to go from accessories to controller boards. However, you can’t use every-day phone jacks or cables because the little plastic clip is on the sidenot the center. No need to give up your dreams of interfacing with NXT parts, though! These jacks are just the right type to let you plug in those cables and expose the 6 wires.

[Small -15 to +15V DC Analog Panel Meter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4403): Analog panel meters are arguably not as blingy or flashy as LEDs, but their simplicity adds a touch of elegance and makes them easier to read quickly.

This Small -15V to +15V Panel Meter is about handheld-size, with three screws to open up the panel and replace the backing paper, if you like. It’s great for analog projects that have a split power supply or large voltage swings.
