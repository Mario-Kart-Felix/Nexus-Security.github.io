[Adafruit 1.3″ 240×240 Wide Angle IPS TFT Display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4520)

This is a screen for advanced hackers who like the look of the TFT screen we’ve put into the Adafruit CLUE and Adafruit Mini PiTFT 1.3″. The 1.3″ display has 240×240 16-bit full-color pixels and is an IPS display, so the color looks great up to 80 degrees off-axis in any direction. The TFT driver (ST7789) is very similar to the popular ST7735, and our Arduino library supports it well.

[SparkFun Qwiic / Stemma QT FeatherWing (Shield for Thing Plus)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4515)

The SparkFun Qwiic FeatherWing (Shield for Thing Plus) provides an easy-to-assemble way to add the STEMMA QT / Qwiic connect ecosystem to any development board with Feather/Thing Plus Footprint. It connects the I2C bus (GND, 3.3V, SDA, and SCL) on your Feather to four SparkFun Qwiic / Stemma QT connectors. The plug-n-play ecosystem allows for easy daisy chaining so, as long as your devices are on different addresses, you can connect as many Qwiic & Stemma QT devices as you’d like.
