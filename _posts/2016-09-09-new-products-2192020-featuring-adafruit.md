[TinyML: Machine Learning with TensorFlow Lite – Pete Warden & Daniel Situnayake](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4526): Deep learning networks are getting smaller. Much smaller. The Google Assistant team can detect words with a model just 14 kilobytes in size—small enough to run on a microcontroller. With this practical book, you’ll enter the field of TinyML, where deep learning and embedded systems combine to make astounding things possible with tiny devices.

Pete Warden and Daniel Situnayake explain how you can train models small enough to fit into any environment. Ideal for software and hardware developers who want to build embedded systems using machine learning, this guide walks you through creating a series of TinyML projects, step-by-step. No machine learning or microcontroller experience is necessary.

[RockBLOCK 9603 with USB Cable – Iridium Satellite Modem Bundle](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4521): The RockBLOCK 9603 allows you to send and receive short messages from anywhere on Earth with a clear view of the sky. And when we say anywhere we mean anywhere. It works far beyond the reach of WiFi and GSM networks. Maybe you want to transmit weather information from mid-ocean? Or use it to control your robot in the middle of the desert? Perhaps you need emergency communications when other networks might not be available? RockBLOCK can help you thanks to the Iridium modem that communicates with the 66 low-Earth-orbit constellation of satellites – it’s the easiest way for developers, makers, and scientists to send and receive data anywhere on Earth.

We can’t wait for spring to arrive, and we’re looking forward to caring for some plants!

Simple, but effective!
