[Adafruit 2.9″ Red/Black/White eInk Display Breakout – THINK INK](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1028): Easy e-paper finally comes to microcontrollers, with this breakout that’s designed to make it a breeze to add a tri-color eInk display. Chances are you’ve seen one of those new-fangled ‘e-readers’ like the Kindle or Nook. They have gigantic electronic paper ‘static’ displays – that means the image stays on the display even when power is completely disconnected. The image is also high contrast and very daylight readable. It really does look just like printed paper!

We’ve liked these displays for a long time, but breakouts were never designed for makers to use. Finally, we decided to make our own! [See more!](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1028)

[Adafruit Feather STM32F405 Express!- Coming soon!](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4382) Sign up to be notified when it’s in stock! ST takes flight in this upcoming Feather board. The new STM32F405 Feather (video) that we designed runs CircuitPython at a blistering 168MHz – our fastest CircuitPython board ever! We put a STEMMA QT / Qwiic port on the end, so you can really easily plug and play I2C sensors. [See more!](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4382)

[JST PH 3-pin Plug-Plug Cable – 100mm long](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4336): This cable is a little over 100mm / 4″ long and fitted with JST-PH 3-pin connectors on either end.

We dig the solid and compact nature of these connectors and the latch that keeps the cable from coming apart easily. We’re carrying these to match up with our STEMMA boards and sensors that have 3-pin connections – and the wires are even color coded! Red is power, ground is black and signal is white.

[TinyPICO – ESP32 Development Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4335): The smallest, most feature-rich ESP32 dev board is here! TinyPICO has incredible processing power for a board that’s shorter than an alkaline battery.

Thanks to creator-maker Seon Rozenblum, you can tinker with a tiny, mighty, uncompromising board with 4MB extra RAM, on-board RGB LED, and a 700 mAh 3.3V regulator. MicroPython firmware is pre-loaded, and with support for Arduino IDE and Espressif IDF, you get the flexibility to code your way. [See more!](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4335)

[AdaBox013 – THE MONSTER M4SK](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4281): I was hacking in the lab quite late one night – soldering pins and debugging the bytes  
When suddenly a bang exploded with sparks, and a figure emerged from the hazy dark!  
(It wore a mask) It wore a monster mask!  
(The monster mask) Its eyes were LCD glass  
(It wore a mask) It had some chips on the back  
(The monster mask) And a sweet solder mask

This Halloween you will be the spookiest in town thanks to ADABOX 13! Cat eyes, or monster peepers…The MONSTER M4SK board included in this BOX can be customized with different eyeball and sound effects to bring your costume or cosplay to life. You can wear the M4SK as a set of goggles, or break it apart to have two independent eyes. Pair it with one of the blank masks included for you to decorate, or perhaps outfit a ghost, skeleton or pumpkin decoration! [See more!](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4281)
