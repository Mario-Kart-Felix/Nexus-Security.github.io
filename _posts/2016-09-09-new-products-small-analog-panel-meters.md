Analog panel meters are arguably not as blingy or flashy as LEDs, but their simplicity adds a touch of elegance and makes them easier to read quickly.

First up, the Voltage Panel Meter!

This **Small -15V to +15V Panel Meter **is about handheld-size, with three screws to open up the panel and replace the backing paper, if you like. It’s great for analog projects that have a split power supply or large voltage swings.

The back is constructed with two bolts the left coil is marked below with Negative to distinguish the positive from the negative. You can wrap a wire around the bolt and use the nuts to keep them in place, or use alligator clips.

Up next, the Current Panel Meter!

This **Small -1 Amp to +1 Amp DC Current Analog Panel Meter** is handheld-size, with three screws to open up the panel and replace the backing paper, if you like.

Great for measuring larger bidirectional current draws, perhaps to and from a battery bank or generator. Of course you can use it just fine with uni-directional current draw as well, either positive or negative currents.

The back is constructed with two bolts the left coil is marked below with Negative to distinguish the positive from the negative. You can wrap a wire around the bolt and use the nuts to keep them in place, or use alligator clips.
