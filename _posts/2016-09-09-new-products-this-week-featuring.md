[Adafruit NeoPXL8 FeatherWing for Feather M4 – 8 x DMA NeoPixels!](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4537)  
Since we first started carrying NeoPixels back in 2012, the chainable RGB LEDs have taken over the world. And a big part of that success is due to the simplicity of their wiring – just one data wire, no matter how many pixels you’ve got. So no surprise they’re everywhere, blinking away in art exhibits, maker faire demos, DJ booths, decorations, and costumes.

But, at some point, every NeoPixel’er bumps into the constraints of that single-data-wire: the timing is very picky and often time your code has to stop completely so that it can burst out the data without any interruptions. This requirement makes it tough to create fast-update lighting effects, and limits the number of pixels you can drive before other hardware peripherals get attention.

[5-pin (Arduino MKR) to 4-pin JST SH STEMMA QT / Qwiic Cable – 100mm long](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4483)  
Are you a maker in the midst of a STEMMA dilemma? This 100mm long cable is a fantastic chimera-cable fitted with STEMMA QT 4-pin JST SH on one end, and Arduino MKR 5-pin JST SH connectors on the other, with the wires spun around so you can use it to connect STEMMA QT sensors we’ve got to any of the popular Arduino MKR boards!

JST SH (also known as Qwiic) connectors have 1mm pitch. This cable can be used with STEMMA QT boards to easily connect sensors and drivers from one board to the other.

[Garmin LIDAR-Lite Optical Distance LED Sensor – V4](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4441)  
Garmin’s LIDAR-Lite LED V4 is the latest, ideal high-performance (but compact) optical distant measurement sensor solution for robotics, Internet of Things, and unmanned vehicles – or any application where an ultrasonic sensor might otherwise be used. Garmin makes high-quality sensors. They’re renowned for their GPS sensors, and these distance sensors are nice and high-quality devices.

You can measure up to 10 meters away with an LED optics sensor that draws only 85 mA during an acquisition. You can easily adjust between accuracy, operating range and measurement time using the I2C command set.

[Tubing for Submersible Pumps – PVC 8mm ID – 1 Meter Long](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4545)

_**Coming soon! Sign up to be notified when in stock**_

This tubing is designed to go with our simple submersible pumps. Great for making water-powered projects. This tubing seems to be made of PVC, it’s definitely not food safe, we recommend it for use with plant-watering or fountain projects only. It’s super easy to cut and you get a full meter!

[Submersible 3V DC Water Pump – Horizontal Type](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4546)

_**Coming soon! Sign up to be notified when in stock**_

Make fountains or plant-watering projects with this submersible water pump. It’s great for beginner projects and super easy to use! The pump is basically a DC motor that is powered with 3V and draws 100mA. When powered, the pump sucks water in from the side of the plastic casing and pushes it out the tubing port. The pump must be primed by keeping it inside water at all times. Reversing the polarity does not turn it into a suction device, it will only pump water!

[Submersible 3V DC Water Pump – Vertical Type](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4547)  
This isn’t for use with drinking water! We don’t have longevity rating for this pump, we’ve run it for a week and it seems OK but we would not recommend it for long term installations. It’s best used by students and artists who want something simple and inexpensive.

You can PWM the motor to speed up or slow down the flow rate. Works great with either a power transistor (basic on/off) or a motor driver chip such as the L293D. If you need a self-priming / food-safe / reversible direction pump, check out our peristaltic pumps!
