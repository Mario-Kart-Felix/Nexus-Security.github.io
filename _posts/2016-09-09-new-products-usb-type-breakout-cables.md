If you’d like to connect a USB-host-capable chip to your USB peripheral, this cable will make the task very simple. **There is no converter chip in this cable!** It’s basically a plain USB cable that’s cut in half and with jumper sockets on the power and data lines. Simple to use, does the job when you have something that exposes the D+/D- pins.

*   Red wire connects to **5V** power (to the USB device)
*   Black wire connects to **common data/power ground**
*   White connects to **D+** data positive
*   Green connects to **D-** data negative
