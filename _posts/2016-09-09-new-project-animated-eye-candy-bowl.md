HWUF in this project we are upgrading our candy bowl with an animated eye. This year we’re tricking out our candy bowl with Adafruit’s HalloWing M4. This animated eye looks pretty realistic and you can use the touch pads to trigger LED animations. So get ready to win this years Halloween with animated eyes.

The HalloWing M4 has everything you need to add an animated eye to your projects. It features a new IPS display so it looks great at just about any angle. It’s also has built in NeoPixels, so you create some really nice lighting effects. In this project, you can touch the pads to cycle through four different LED animations.

It’s really easy to setup the HalloWing M4 with new software. With Adafruit’s firmware, you can install new programs without having to setup arduino.  
Just download the UF2 files from the learn guide. Plug in over USB and double press the reset button to load the BOOT drive. Then just drag and drop the UF2 file onto the USB drive. The board will automatically restart with the new software. This makes the process so much easier so you can quickly get your projects up and running.  
It’s never been easier to add electronics into your projects.

This was a lot of fun to work on and we hope this inspires you to get your projects ready for halloween. Be sure to check out the adafruit discord server so you can chat with the community. We wanna give big shout out to you folks sharing your projects! We invite you to Adafruit’s Show and Tell Live stream so you can be awarded a free vinyl sticker.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!

The [Adafruit Learning System](http://learn.adafruit.com) has dozens of great tools to get you well on your way to creating incredible works of engineering, interactive art, and design with your 3D printer! If you’ve made a cool project that combines 3D printing and electronics, be sure to let us know, and we’ll [feature](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) it here!
