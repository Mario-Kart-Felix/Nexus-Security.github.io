Build a light up LEGO head with Adafruit’s Circuit Playground Express! 3D print the parts and make an interactive lamp that plays sound clips from the LEGO movie. It uses the built-in accelerometer to do shake detect to play audio wave files and animate NeoPixels.

With the built-in accelerometer, we can do shake detection to play music and animate the NeoPixels. The Circuit Playground snap fits into the case and screws into the bottom of the head. A mini speaker at the top screws right in so it’s easy to assemble.

Use Adafruit’s Circuit Python to program the NeoPixels and play audio files. You can use the code to create your own sketches with flash animations with shake-to-play audio wave files.

The Adafruit STEMMA speaker is a plug and play amplifier with a built-in speaker. You can use JST cables and easily connect it to other boards. It’s also got large pads for alligator clips so it’s great for throwing together a quick project. With the STEMMA speaker you can easily add audio to your projects.
