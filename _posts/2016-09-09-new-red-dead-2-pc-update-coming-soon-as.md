Rockstar has issued a statement on technical issues with its launch of [Red Dead Redemption 2](https://www.gamespot.com/red-dead-redemption-2/) on PC. The studio said it is rolling out an update starting today to fix some technical issues, but more severe problems caused by conflicts between certain CPUs and Nvidia cards and drivers will take more time to resolve.

In the statement issued on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1194669204802281476), Rockstar says that persistent problems appear to be due to "unforeseen issues related to specific combinations of Nvidia graphics drivers, Nvidia GPU cards and certain CPUs." To that end, it says it is working with Nvidia to resolve the issue in a future update, but it may take a few days to test the update fully and assure it addresses the problem.

"We sincerely apologize for this temporary inconvenience and will update you as soon as we have more information to share—we want everyone to be able to experience Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC as we intended as soon as possible," the statement reads.
