We’re happy to announce that we’re launching a new version of the [Removals report](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9689846) in Search Console, which enables site owners to **temporarily** hide a page from appearing in Google Search results. The new report also provides info on pages on your site that have been reported via other Google public tools.  
  
There are different tools available for you to report and [remove information from Google](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6332384), in this post we’ll focus on three areas that will be part of the new Search Console report: temporary removals, outdated content and SafeSearch filtering requests.  

Temporary removals
------------------

A temporary removal request is a way to remove specific content on your site from Google Search results. For example, if you have a URL that you need to take off Google Search quickly, you should use this tool. A successful request lasts about six months, which should be enough for you to find a permanent solution. You have two types of requests available:  

*   Temporary remove URL will hide the URL from Google Search results for about six months and clear the cached copy of the page.
    
*   Clear cache URL clears the cached page and wipes out the page description snippet in Search results until the page is crawled again.

Outdated content
----------------

The outdated content section provides information on removal requests made through the public Remove Outdated Content tool, which can be used by anyone (not just site owners) to update search results showing information that is no longer present on a page.

SafeSearch filtering
--------------------

The SafeSearch filtering section in Search Console shows a history of pages on your site that were reported by Google users as adult content using the SafeSearch Suggestion tool. URLs submitted using this tool are reviewed, and if Google feels that this content should be filtered from SafeSearch results, these URLs are tagged as adult content.
