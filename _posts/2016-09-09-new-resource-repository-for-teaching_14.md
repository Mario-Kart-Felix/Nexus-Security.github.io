> We are working to create a comprehensive Resource Repository for teaching computing: a collection of over 500 hours of teaching materials to help you with the delivery of the entire computing curriculum from Key Stages 1 to 4 in England. The purpose of the Resource Repository is to reduce your workload whilst also supporting you to increase your subject knowledge and have a greater understanding of effective pedagogy.
