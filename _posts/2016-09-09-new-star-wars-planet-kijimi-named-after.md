> J.J. Abrams, mega-nerd – not only is the _Star Wars_ writer/director a scifi fan, but synth fan, too. No spoilers here, but his love of a certain synthesizer comes out in _Rise of Skywalker_‘s script.

> Kijimi is the lush polysynth from Black Corporation, also makers of Deckard’s Dream (the Yamaha CS-80 homage) and assorted modules. The _Star Wars_ boss is a known Black Corporation customer himself – you can spot him in a photo posing on the balcony of Black’s Shibuya, Tokyo offices with his new Kimiji – and it seems both the name and synth inspired him.
