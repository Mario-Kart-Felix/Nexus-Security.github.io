In this video we’re taking a look at Adafruit’s Clue dev board. This features the same shape and size like the BBC micro bit so it’ll work with existing add-ons. Adafruit Clue has a 1.3in IPS display so you can make projects with text and graphics. It’s packed with sensors like accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, pressure, temperature and much more. It features the nrf52840 cortex M4 processor with 2mb of internal flash. It also has a microphone, speaker, neopixel and STEMMA connector so you can plug and play even more sensors. With bluetooth you can make wireless projects that can control your BLE devices. For example, you can control your phone using Apple’s Music Service to play, pause and even change the volume.

With adafruit’s circuit python you can make cool projects using adafruit’s libraries and demo code.

The learn guide has all the documentation you need and examples so you can quickly get projects up and running. With circuit python your code and libraries live on the board like a USB drive so you can access your code on any computer. This makes development really fast because you don’t have to compile the code so you can see your updates almost instantly. So Get Clue and start learning how to sense the world around you.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!

The [Adafruit Learning System](http://learn.adafruit.com) has dozens of great tools to get you well on your way to creating incredible works of engineering, interactive art, and design with your 3D printer! If you’ve made a cool project that combines 3D printing and electronics, be sure to let us know, and we’ll [feature](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) it here!
