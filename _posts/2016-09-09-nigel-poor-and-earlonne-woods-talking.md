From [Feature Shoot](https://www.featureshoot.com/2019/09/a-powerful-journey-through-san-quentin-californias-oldest-and-most-notorious-prison/):

> In The San Quentin Project, Poor counters fiction with fact through a series of profound personal histories shared in photographs, visual documents, and Ear Hustle, an acclaimed podcast co-produced with Earlonne Woods. Originally designed to run exclusively on the San Quentin institutional channel, Ear Hustle became a platform for inmates to tell their story in their own words.
