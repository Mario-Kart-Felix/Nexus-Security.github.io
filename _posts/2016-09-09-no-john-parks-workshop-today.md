**John Park’s Workshop** won’t be broadcast today — enjoy your **Thanksgiving** and come back **next week** for more Projects, MakeCode Minute, Game of the Week, and more!

Thank you all so much for being a part of this wonderful community of makers, crafters, coders, teachers, hackers, and builders!

Join maker John Park in his workshop each week as he builds, demos, hacks, and mods projects live on air! “**John Park’s Workshop — LIVE**” is the place to see creative projects come to life, as John uses a wide variety of tools and techniques to make everything from mystery boxes to pinball controllers to drink robots, using digital fabrication, hand and power tools, microcontrollers, and more. Come on into the chat to participate in the fun! **Every Thursday @ 4pm ET/1pm PT!**
