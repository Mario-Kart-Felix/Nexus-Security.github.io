In an official press release regarding the support for Wi-Fi calling on Nokia smartphones, HMD Global said that the feature will help Nokia users retain connectivity even in areas with poor cellular connectivity. According to the company, _“as users move from Wi-Fi into a non-Wi-Fi location, the call is seamlessly moved to their telecom network. Moreover, users on the above Nokia smartphones can also make Vo-Wi-Fi calls to a person who doesn’t have the feature enabled on their phone”_.  

In case you don’t know it already, VoWi-Fi, popularly known as Wi-Fi calling, lets users make phone calls directly from their smartphone to any other mobile or landline via a Wi-Fi network and without the use any third-party app. It is especially useful users in low-network-coverage areas, as well as those who face network coverage and quality issues indoors.
