On the [Nordic Semiconductor DevZone](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/), they have an excellent [online power profiling tool](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/nordic/power) for its nRF52810, nRF52832, and nRF52840 microcontrollers with Bluetooth.

Use is extremely slick. Select the chip, the voltage, DCDC regulator, clock type, and Bluetooth characteristics like radio transmit power, role, advertising interval and payload bytes.

The tool will then provide a graph of time vs. current and which processes are consuming power. The screen with the chart is shown below.

If you are doing nRF designs, this chart could help you estimate performance and power that otherwise use a rack of test equipment.

[See the website for the tool here](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/nordic/power).
