NordVPN, a VPN provider has affirmed an intrusion on one of its servers in Finland, although the damage done was nothing serious. There were no dubious records on the server. “We don't trace, retrieve or distribute users' data. It is almost impossible for the attacker to obtain usernames and identifications and also, the hacker couldn't decipher the VPN traffic to different servers,” says the company.

"The only probable way to exploit website traffic was by doing an individual and complex MiTM breach to prevent a private connection that attempted to locate nordvpn.com," commented the company on its website. The attack happened in March 2018, when an unapproved user located the NordVPN server in Finland. They used an "unsafe remote administration system" that the data hub provider had forgotten.  The company didn't know of any such system. The server misused was attached to NordVPN's server record on January 31.  
  
The service provider caught the violation and dismissed the account on 20th March without notifying the network provider NordVPN. The company discovered the attack several months back and immediately discontinued its engagement with the data center provider and cleansed all the details on the borrowed servers. It didn't reveal the infringement instantly because the company had to investigate the rest of its system to prevent the same incident from happening again. It also stimulated the decryption of our systems.  
  
"This took a while because of the complex infrastructure and more than 3000 servers that our firm handles," says NordVPN. The problem didn't stir any of NordVPN's other servers. The company says that it would need engaged providers to reach more formidable safety measures. "We are also moving all of our data centers to RAM and this process would take another one year to complete," says NordVPN. While the break won't have any meaningful result on user secrecy, it will create a negative image of the company in the internet society. “NordVPN is multiplying measures on user privacy. We have supported an administration safety inspection and we are striving on a secondary no-records examination for the moment and are planning a fault munificence project." NordVPN will start autonomous surface scrutiny of its data systems to ensure it doesn't miss any loopholes.
