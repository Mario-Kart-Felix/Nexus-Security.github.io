Internet censorship is gradually increasing across nations in the world. A new report from Comparitech – a UK-based research and comparison firm sheds light on the internet censorship practices followed by various countries and let me tell you, the results are intimidating.  

To consolidate the study, the firm studied the **restrictions and bans on torrents, pornography, social media, political media, and VPN**s. They allotted points based on the restrictions. Two points were allotted for a complete ban and a single point for restrictions.  

**North Korea** topped the list with a 10/10 censorship score. You won’t be able to legally access social media, watch porn, or use torrents or VPNs in the country. **China came second** with a 9/10 score. The only place where China lost a point was in torrent ban. The country restricts torrents but it has not banned torrents completely. Western social media is banned while Chinese social media platforms are allowed.

In case you’re wondering, India scores 4/10. As _[TNW](https://thenextweb.com/privacy/2020/01/15/study-north-korea-china-and-russia-top-internet-censorship-charts/)_ points out, internet shutdowns imposed by governments are not included in the study. If that was the case, India would score extra points as our country is unfortunately one of the leaders in [internet shutdowns](https://in.reuters.com/article/india-citizenship-internet-idINKBN1YO1WR) resulting in [huge losses for businesses](https://beebom.com/india-lost-rs-21000-crores-internet-shutdowns/).
