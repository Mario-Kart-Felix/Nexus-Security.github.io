Adafruit has been doing a form of live video “show and tell” for about 10 years or so, every single week. We started with Google Hangouts, and after that was sunsetted by Google, we moved to StreamYard and it’s fantastic. The [video](https://youtu.be/kMrRTtFP5I8) above is from our show and tell from last week. We have some of our team show what they’re up to and anyone around the world can join in and show and share their latest project. We’ve hired about a dozen people from meeting them via our show and tell, we’ve seen kids grow up before our eyes over a decade, we’ll made friends, a community together, we’ve had folks stream from hospital beds to makerspaces to girl scout troops.

[Here’s the playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7E1FAA9E63A32FDC), there are about 400 videos … and check out [StreamYard,](https://streamyard.com/) we have nothing to do with them other than using their service. We stream the show and tell, each week to: YouTube, Facebook, Twitch, Mixer, LinkeIn, and Periscope. The text chat is in our [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) with about 16,000 members: [https://discord.gg/adafruit](https://discord.gg/adafruit)

If you have a company or community (or both!), try it out, and if you make “something”, anything, (everyone does!), stop by and join us any Weds at 7:30pm ET.
