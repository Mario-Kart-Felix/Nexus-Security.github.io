Plex

Folks who use the Plex on iOS and Apple TV now have the [ability to schedule recordings](https://twitter.com/plex/status/1179439584054300672) while watching Live TV, part of a Plex subscription service that uses a digital tuner and HDTV antenna to deliver over-the-air television broadcasts.

Accessing Plex Live TV requires you to be a [Plex Pass](https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/) subscriber for $5 per month, $40 per year, or $120 for a lifetime subscription. In addition to providing access to [Live TV and DVR](https://support.plex.tv/articles/225877347-live-tv-dvr/) capabilities, Plex Pass can sync content for offline access, enable parental controls, and more.

Along with the ability to schedule recordings while watching Live TV, Plex version 6.2 brings a host of bug fixes and other improvements such as the addition of “Exclude Labels” and “Content Ratings” restrictions to user sharing settings, and fixed support for automatically pausing video playback when headphones are disconnected.

Other bug fixes include one where cancelled recordings would show the wrong message, another that would break the grid user interface when using the iPad in landscape mode, as well as various podcast-related problems and several issues that would cause the software to crash.
