![](https://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Instagram-Layout-1024x712.jpg) Instagram has introduced a new feature for everyone in Stories that lets users capture and share multiple photos in a single story from within the app itself. Via an app update, users will be able to post up to 6 photos in a single story through a simple interface that lets users choose between different layouts. Layout can be accessed via swiping to the end of the many features present in Instagram. There are currently 6 different layouts options, having space for 2 to 6 photos, with different orientation options. Once users have clicked or added each photo individually to a particular layout, they will be able to use Instagram's regular editing suite for adding texts, stickers and more. The feature is likely to become popular with users as previously they would require third party apps to create something like this. Instagram has been slowly adding features to its Stories, features like Create mode that lets users interact with their followers through polls, etc. It seems like Instagram will continue to expand these features in the future, capturing more users for its platform.
