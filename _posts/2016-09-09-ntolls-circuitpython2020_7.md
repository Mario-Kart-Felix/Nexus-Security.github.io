@ntoll (of Mu fame) just posted [his thoughts](http://ntoll.org/article/circuitpython-2020) on #CircuitPython2020. Read the full post [on his blog](http://ntoll.org/article/circuitpython-2020) for his three hopes for CircuitPython including a “moon on a stick” hope. Here is a snippet:

This is an extraordinary achievement. My own experience in the wider Python community is that it takes a huge amount of effort, patience, compassion and thoughtfulness to grow and sustain such a “scenius”
