Just a day after [Xiaomi detailed its 100W Super Charge Turbo technology](https://beebom.com/lu-weibing-shares-technical-difficulties-100w-super-charge-turbo/) in China, ZTE’s consumer smartphone brand, Nubia, has started teasing its own 80W battery-charging tech that will likely make its way into the company’s upcoming flagship product, the **Red Magic 5G**. According to an image posted on Weibo by the CEO and Co-Founder of Nubia, Ni Fei, the company’s next-gen fast-charging tech will charge at 8.4V/ 9.6A, which translates to 80.64W.  

While Fei didn’t reveal which device will be the first to get the new charging tech, he did say that it will be a 5G smartphone with a 144Hz display, raising speculations that he might be referring to the Red Magic 5G. Nubia has already confirmed plans to launch its next-gen [Red Magic gaming handset with 5G connectivity](https://beebom.com/red-magic-5g-snapdragon-865-confirmed/) and a [144Hz display](https://beebom.com/nubia-red-magic-5g-144hz-display-support/), so it’s likely that the new technology will by first used in that very device before possibly making its way to other handsets in the coming days. The device has also been [confirmed to be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 SoC](https://beebom.com/red-magic-5g-snapdragon-865-confirmed/).

Meanwhile, reports about Nubia’s next-gen fast-charging technology comes just a day after Xiaomi’s China President, Lu Weibing, shared details about the company’s 100W Super Charge Turbo fast-charging technology and the difficulties the company is trying to overcome to implement it in a consumer device.  

As things stand now, Oppo’s [65W SuperVOOC charging](https://beebom.com/oppo-65w-charging-tech-unveiled/) in the [Reno Ace](https://beebom.com/oppo-reno-ace-90hz-display-sd-855-quad-cameras-goes-official/) is the fastest charging technology in any commercially-available smartphone, so it will be interesting to see if Nubia will be able to wrest that crown with the new tech in the coming months.
