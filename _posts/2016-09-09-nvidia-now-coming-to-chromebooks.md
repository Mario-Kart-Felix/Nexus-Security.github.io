Having rolled out the beta version of its [‘GeForce Now’ game-streaming service on Android](https://beebom.com/geforce-now-streaming-service-rolling-out-android/) last year, Nvidia on Tuesday announced that the service is finally out of beta and available for all users on Windows, Mac and Android. In addition, the company has also confirmed plans to soon launch a web-client that’s being specifically designed for Chromebooks and Android TV devices. There’s no exact time-frame for the launch, but the company says that it’s likely to happen before the end of this year.  

It’s worth noting that Nvidia has been testing [GeForce Now](https://beebom.com/nvidia-geforce-now-server-specifications/) on Windows and Mac for a number of years, while the Android app was only launched last August. It was also available on Nvidia Shield and, is expected to hit more Android TV devices going forward. The service is expected to be a major competitor in the fledgling game-streaming sector, which includes names like [Google Stadia](https://beebom.com/stadia-launch-lineup-22-games/) and [Apple Arcade](https://beebom.com/apple-arcade-annual-plan-launched-at-rs-999-in-india/). Having said that, the service is geared more towards PC gamers, with support for stores like Steam, Uplay, Epic and Battle.net.  

In case you don’t know it already, GeForce Now is Nvidia’s take on cloud gaming, and runs on the company’s own graphics processors, although, the company now says that it is allowing cross-play with players who aren’t using Nvidia GPUs. The service also allows gamers to bring their game libraries with them, thanks to its support for the aforementioned game stores. Games currently supported include the likes of _Fallout 76, Fortnite_, _Shadow of the Tomb Raider_, _Wolfenstein: Youngblood_ and _World of Tanks_, with more titles expected to be added in the coming days.
