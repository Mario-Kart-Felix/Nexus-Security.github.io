With Earth in the throes of climate change and no suitable Planet B lined up just yet, oceanography is as important now as it has ever been. And yet, the instruments relied upon for decades to test ocean conditions are holding steady within the range of expensive to prohibitively expensive. Like any other area of science, lowering the barrier of entry has almost no disadvantages — more players means more data, and that means more insight into the inner workings of the briny deep.

[![](https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/mag-switch.png?w=250)](https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/mag-switch.png)\[Oceanography for Everyone\] aims to change all that by showing the world just how easy it is to build an oceanographic testing suite that measures conductivity (aka salinity), temperature, and depth using common components. [OpenCTD](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD) is designed primarily for use on the continental shelf, and has been successfully tested to a depth of 100 meters.

An Adalogger M0 and RTC Featherwing run the show from their waterproof booth in the center of the PVC tube. There’s a 14-bar pressure sensor for depth, a trio of DS18B20s for temperature averaging, and a commercial conductivity probe that gathers salinity data. These sensors are fed through a 3D-printed base plate and ultimately potted in stainless steel epoxy. The other end of the tube is sealed with a mechanical plug that seats and unseats with the whirl of a wingnut.

We particularly like the scratch-built magnetic slide switch that turns OpenCTD on and off without the need to open the cylinder. If you’d like to build one of these for yourself, take a deep dive into \[Oceanography for Everyone\]’s [comprehensive guide](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD/blob/master/OpenCTD_Feather_Adalogger/OpenCTD_ConstructionOperation.pdf) — it covers the components, construction, and calibration in remarkable detail. The switch is explained starting on page 50. You can find out more about the work Oceanography for Everyone is doing at [their site](http://oceanographyforeveryone.com/).

As far as cheap waterproof enclosures go, PVC is a great choice. [It works well for underwater photography, too](https://hackaday.com/2018/02/27/pipecam-shallow-water-exploration-with-raspberry-pi/).
