> If you have a 3D printer, you probably have discovered how useful the Octoprint software is. You can view, monitor and control your print jobs remotely from your home, office or around the world via a web browser. I use my garage as my workshop, and I keep my MonoPrice Mini Select 3D printer there, checking on print jobs from the office in my house. Using Octoprint saves a lot of steps.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And donâ€™t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
