Poland is the world’s most popular destination for temporary labour migrants for the second year running, according to a new report released by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).

Published this week, the report found that in 2017 1.1 million temporary migrants moved to Poland, putting it ahead of the United States, which received 691,000 workers, and Germany with just over 400,000. The 1.1 million was a 32 percent increase on the 2016 rate.

According to the report, a temporary migrant can move to a country for anything from a few weeks to a few years. But it also found that the number of foreigners in Poland applying for a residency permit in 2017 rose to 47,000, an increase of 5.1 percent on the previous year.

Most of the non-permanent workers, the OECD has found, either take up seasonal work in sectors such as agriculture and construction or find temporary jobs.
