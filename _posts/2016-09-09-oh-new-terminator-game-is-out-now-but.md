[Terminator: Resistance](https://www.gamespot.com/terminator-resistance/), a new action/stealth title set in a post-Judgment Day period of the Terminator timeline, is out today for PS4, Xbox One, and PC--but only if you're in Australia or Europe. Players in the US hoping to get their hands on the new Terminator game will have to wait a while longer if they want to play the game on consoles, as the game's American release on PS4 and Xbox One has been delayed until December 10. Curiously, it went [up on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/954740/Terminator_Resistance/) in the US on November 14, so it's available on PC. The game has had a quiet release, slipping in under the radar during a busy period for new releases.

The game, which follows the timeline established by the first two movies (and ignores the other films, much like recent cinema release [Terminator: Dark Fate](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/terminator-dark-fate-review-a-fresh-start/1900-6417346/)), mixes [action and stealth](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/terminator-resistances-gameplay-trailer-shows-how-/1100-6471125/). The game casts players as Jacob Rivers, who is part of the resistance against Skynet's army of machines. He'll need to take down using a variety of energy weapons and hacking abilities, but also avoid combat whenever he's not armed with an appropriate gun. It's developed by Teyon, the studio behind [Rambo: The Video Game](https://www.gamespot.com/rambo-the-video-game/).

It's unclear exactly why this delay has happened, but December 10 is certainly a less crowded release date than November 15--Terminator: Resistance is going up against both [Star Wars: Fallen Order](https://www.gamespot.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/) and [Pokemon Sword & Shield](https://www.gamespot.com/pokemon-shield/) in regions where it launches today. It's unusual for games to have staggered release dates in 2019, although not unheard of. [Google Stadia](https://www.gamespot.com/stadia/) launches next week, but by the end of November it will only be available in 14 countries: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, and the United States.
