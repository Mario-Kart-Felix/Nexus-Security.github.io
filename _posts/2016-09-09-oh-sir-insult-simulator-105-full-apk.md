Oh Sir The Insult Simulator 1.05 FULL APK For Android

The parrot is back from the dead bringing countless new insults for your disposal, Sir! Remember that silly game that parted lovers, destroyed families and turned friends into enemies? Hereâs its successor that does even more, certainly with more style and more variety. And I have proof!  
Then meet a retired hipster who admires pictures of a grunting sow, and a fake Russian who borrowed a dead body to put his teacup and crumpets on. Itâs also the only game that lets you learn whatâs The Meaning of Life, and thatâs scientifically proven!
