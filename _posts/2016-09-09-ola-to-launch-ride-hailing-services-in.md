Indian cab-hailing company, Ola, has announced that it will officially launch its services in London, UK, on February 10. In a press release on Friday, the company claimed that its platform will be _“fully operational from day one”_, with over 20,000 drivers having registered since it [began on-boarding late last year](https://beebom.com/ola-registrations-london/). The company [announced plans to start operations in the British capital](https://beebom.com/ola-starts-hiring-drivers-in-london-ahead-of-impending-launch/) last November after receiving a 15-month license to operate in the city in July 2019.  

Announcing its plans for London in the coming months, Ola said it _“will maintain its differentiated focus on drivers, safety and a collaborative approach through its launch in London and beyond”_. The company also claims to be offering ‘the best revenue share’ to enable its driver partners to keep a larger share of their income. _“Drivers joining the platform will benefit from six weeks of zero commission and market-leading commission rates thereafter”_, said the company.  

While Ola has been operating in the UK since 2018, it obtained the license to operate in London only last July. Interestingly, its US-based rival, [Uber, lost its license to operate in the city](https://beebom.com/uber-loses-license-to-operate-in-london/) last November after the local transport regulator, Transport for London (TfL), declared the cab aggregator ‘unqualified’ following a spate of safety failures. In its report, TfL cited a _‘pattern of failures’_ on Uber’s part to ensure public safety as the primary reason for its refusal to grant Uber a license.  

As for Ola, the company originally entered the UK in 2018 by starting operations in South Wales. It has since expanded to a number of prominent cities in the country, including Birmingham, Bristol and Liverpool. The company has provided more than 3 million rides with over 11,000 drivers operating on the platform around the country.
