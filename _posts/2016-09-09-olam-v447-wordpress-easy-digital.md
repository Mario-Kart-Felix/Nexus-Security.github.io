Last week we emailed some companies in the maker world to see what sales they were going to have for Black Friday / Cyber Monday, etc, most of them got back to us, others did not, but we’ll cover them any way if they have sales that we can find.

We’re calling this #ADADEALS – they are sales and deals that are not from Adafruit and happen to be in the maker / electronics / engineering community in some way ([we’ve done this before](https://blog.adafruit.com/2017/11/24/sales-deals-donations-and-more-for-makers-besides-adafruit-this-is-massive-blackfriday-cybermonday-adadeals/)).

Some could say we’re linking to and promoting “competitors” but we do not see it that way…all companies in this space are working together (or could!) to make great hardware for the Maker community and we are inspired by them!

Follow #ADADEALS [on the blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/?s=%23adadeals) and [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23adadeals&src=typed_query&f=live). And post your own, use the tag #ADADEALS and we’ll Re-Tweet it and all that.
