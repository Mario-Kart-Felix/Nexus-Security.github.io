Check out [OLinuXino – Open Source Hardware Boards](https://www.olimex.com/Products/OLinuXino/open-source-hardware) –

> OLinuXino are series of powerful Linux-enabled Open Source Software and Open Source Hardware  boards, designed and manufactured by Olimex LTD. Boards from the OLinuXino family can be manufactured with components suitable for  operation in either industrial (-40+85)C or commercial (0-70)C temerpature range. Different OLinuXino boards use processors from different manufacturers – Allwinner, Freescale, etc. OLinuXino boards are completely open source and you have access to all the CAD files and sources and you can reuse them for your own personal or commercial projects. This brings security to your business, you own everything and have control. There are NO restrictions for manufacturing and selling our designs or boards in your own applications. 

OLIMEX had an [open-source hardware month event](https://olimex.wordpress.com/2019/10/04/come-to-open-source-hardware-day-on-october-19th-in-plovdiv-and-learn-about-how-open-source-hardware-is-made/) [too!](https://ohm.oshwa.org/event/open-source-day/)

OLIMEX made an [open-source laptop](https://www.olimex.com/Products/DIY-Laptop/KITS/TERES-A64-BLACK/). TERES-I is do it yourself (DIY) free open-source hardware (FOSH) and free open-source software (FOSS) laptop kit. Ready-to-assemble using the instructions provided. KiCAD FOSS software is used to design all the hardware, schematics and board files available on their GitHub pages.

![Ohm](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2019/09/ohm.jpg)

October is [open-source hardware month](https://ohm.oshwa.org/)! Every single day in October we’ll be posting up some open-source stories from the last decade (and more!) about open-source hardware, open-source software, and beyond!

Have an open-source hardware (or software) success story? A person, company, or project to celebrate? An open-source challenge? Post up here in the comments or email [opensource@adafruit.com](mailto:opensource@adafruit.com), we’ll be looking for, and using the tag [#OHM2019](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OHM2019&src=typed_query&f=live) online as well! Check out [all the events](https://ohm.oshwa.org/events/) going on here!
