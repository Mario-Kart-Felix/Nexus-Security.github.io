OnePlus is rushing to bring the latest Android experiences to more of its devices. It has already rolled out the [stable Android 10-based OxygenOS 10 update](https://beebom.com/android-10-oxygen-os-10-rolling-out-oneplus-7-pro/) to OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro devices earlier last month. And well, the company recently promised that OnePlus 6 and 6T users will soon be able to enjoy Android 10 as well.  

Keeping that promise, the Chinese giant has today started rolling out the much-awaited Android 10 update to its previous-gen OnePlus 6 and OnePlus 6T devices with the latest Open Beta build. This brings all of the new features we’ve seen OnePlus talk about at its OnePlus 7T series launch events, with a slightly revamped and snappy UI.  

Some users have already downloaded the latest Open Beta build and in the process of making the leap to Android 10. Since this is a beta update, you won’t see OTA update notifications instead, you will have to download the Open Beta ROMs via these links –[OnePlus 6](https://oxygenos.oneplus.net/OnePlus6Oxygen_22_OTA_060_all_1910081733_f1563bcedbf94488.zip) and [OnePlus 6T](https://oxygenos.oneplus.net/OnePlus6TOxygen_41_OTA_060_all_1910081734_759171f133294ef4.zip) if you’re eager to test out the new features.

OnePlus added a note in the [official forum post](https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oxygenos-android-10-open-beta-1-for-the-oneplus-6-and-oneplus-6t.1120323/), pointing out that Open Beta 1 build has been released only for _“OnePlus 6/6T unlocked Non Carrier variants,”_ which could mean users in the United States or the United Kingdom may not be able to try out Android 10 right away.
