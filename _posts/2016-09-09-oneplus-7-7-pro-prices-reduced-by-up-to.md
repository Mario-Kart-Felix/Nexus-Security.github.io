A day after [unveiling the OnePlus 7T in India](https://beebom.com/oneplus-7t-launched-price-specs-features/), the Chinese smartphone-maker has slashed the prices of its last-gen smartphones. According to a listing from Amazon, the OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro will be available for a discount of Rs. 3,000 and Rs. 4,000, respectively, during the upcoming [Great Indian Festival Sale](https://www.amazon.in/diwali-great-indian-festival/b?ie=UTF8&node=3419926031) from September 29 – October 4.  

As part of the deal, the 6GB+128GB model of the OnePlus 7 will be available for Rs. 29,999 (around $420) during the sale period, while the OnePlus 7 Pro will have a starting price of Rs. 44,999 (around $635) for its base variant. They were earlier priced at Rs. 32,999 (around $466) and Rs. 48,999 (around $490), respectively. While the higher-end variants are also expected to be discounted, the e-tailer doesn’t seem to have specified the exact prices from what we could see.

OnePlus 7, 7 Pro Discounts for Amazon’s Great Indian Festival Sale

The price-drop makes the OnePlus 7 an extremely lucrative proposition for many who might have been eyeing the Redmi K20 Pro now that the latter is priced at just Rs. 24,999 [after getting a Rs. 3,000 discount](https://beebom.com/redmi-k20-pro-discounted-to-rs-24999-for-xiaomis-diwali-sale/) as part of Xiaomi’s upcoming Diwali sale. However, it will be interesting to see if the lower pricing of the OnePlus 7 will cannibalize sales of the OnePlus 7T, which is not something the company would be bargaining for.  

As a refresher, OnePlus on Thursday launched the OnePlus 7T for Rs. 37,999 in India. The device comes with a few notable upgrades over the standard OnePlus 7, including the Snapdragon 855+ SoC, a 19:9 90Hz Fluid AMOLED display, a triple-cam setup, an extra 2GB of RAM and slightly faster Warp Charge 30T. All of that makes it a definite improvement over the OnePlus 7, but the reduced pricing will now make the older device an attractive proposition for many potential buyers.
