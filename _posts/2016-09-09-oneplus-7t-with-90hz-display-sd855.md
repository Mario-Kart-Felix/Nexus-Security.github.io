We all knew the [OnePlus 7T](https://beebom.com/oneplus-7t-shown-off-official-renders/) was coming and well, at its launch event organized in New Delhi, OnePlus has officially taken the wraps off its next-gen flagship smartphone. The OnePlus 7T is everything we expected it to be, complete with an AMOLED display with higher 90Hz refresh rate, Snapdragon 855 Plus under the hood, triple cameras, and an even faster charging technology. So, let’s not beat around the bush and take a look at OnePlus 7T’s in-depth specs sheet:  

OnePlus 7T: Specs and Features
------------------------------

  

Starting off with the design, OnePlus 7T has upgraded the design to now offer users an even premium and comfortable experience. It has a mere 8.1mm thickness, which goes down to 3.2mm at the edges. The company has now provided a “4th-gen matte-frosted glass finish” on the rear, which uses a new combination of films to flaunt a new _“difused reflection”_ pattern under different lighting conditions. There’s a huge triple camera bump on the rear, which we have talked about in detail below.

It will be available in two stunning color variants namely Frosted Silver and Glacier Blue. We’ve got the latter of the two and it looks absolutely stunning — a minor upgrade over [OnePlus 7 Pro](https://beebom.com/oneplus-7-vs-oneplus-7-pro/).  

OnePlus 7 Pro brought a new higher refresh rate display to the company’s portfolio and well, the company is now democratizing the smoother experience to everyone with the OnePlus 7T. It **features a taller 6.65-inch Full-HD+ Fluid AMOLED display**, with a 90Hz refresh rate, 20:9 aspect ratio, and 2400×1080 pixels resolution. It has HDR-10+ certification, maximum brightness up to 1000 nits, reduced blue light by 42% and sRGB color gamut support.

The OnePlus 7T display isn’t curved at the edges, which is good as there’s been a lot of accidental touch complaints for the OnePlus 7 Pro. Also, it would defeat the purpose of having two devices in the lineup. You still have a waterdrop notch up top, which is now claimed to be smaller, and an in-display fingerprint scanner, which is faster than before – **unlocking the OnePlus 7T in just 0.21 seconds**.  

The rumors were indeed true. OnePlus 7T is **powered by the latest Snapdragon 855 Plus chipset**, paired with up to 8GB RAM and up to 256GB UFS 3.0 internal storage. It comes equipped with dual-stereo speakers, new linear haptic vibration motor, and much more.  

The most significant change that you all may have noticed already is the **massive new triple camera setup**, which is no longer a vertical array. Instead, OnePlus 7T sports a considerable circular camera bump that makes the device rock when placed flat on the table and it could get annoying for some users.

As for the sensor onboard, you’re getting a primary 48MP (f/1.6) Sony IMX586 sensor, 16MP (f/2.2) ultra-wide-angle lens with a 117-degree field-of-view (FOV), and finally a 12MP (f/2.2) telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom. There’s a dual-LED flash located just below these sensors.  

The **primary camera on OnePlus 7T is optically stabilized**, which when coupled with EIS renders you hybrid image stabilization (HIS) for more stable video recording at up to 4K/ 60fps. OnePlus has added 720p **super slow-mo video recording at 960fps** and a **new Super Stable video recording** feature (similar to what we’ll find on Oppo Reno 2), which sounds cool.  

OnePlus has slightly tweaked the camera UI and introduced a new UltraShot Engine into the mix to provide better landscape and backlit photos. You’ve got all your cool features such as the Nightscape (also available on the ultra-wide-angle lens), Portrait mode, Pro Mode (with a dedicated 48MP mode), and others intact on the OnePlus 7T. One of my favorite camera features, however, is the **ability to capture macro shots** as close as 2.5cms.  

OnePlus 7T is the world’s first smartphone to come with Android 10 out-of-the-box. The device also runs the latest version of the company’s own OxygenOS custom skin, which obviously is OxygenOS 10. It now comes with minor UI upgrades, paired with a slew of new features.

OxygenOS 10 brings in tow the **new fullscreen gesture navigation** from Android 10, offering the back swipe gesture from both sides of the screen. The launch animation in landscape mode has been optimized to remove the blinking effect, rotation, and offer a smooth experience.  

There’s a **new Smart Ambient Display** onboard, which shows contextual information such as weather, music, and calendar events. OxygenOS 10 improves pick-up gestures (with improved sensitivity, thanks to AI), AI noise reduction, and a new updated gallery app, among other things.  

Apart from the display, internals, and cameras, OnePlus 7T brings in tow an “[upgraded Warp Charge 30T](https://beebom.com/oneplus-7t-faster-charging-7pro/)” wired charging feature. It’s still the same **30W (6V/5A) charging technology** that we’ve seen on the OnePlus 7 Pro (first seen on [OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition](https://beebom.com/oneplus-6t-mclaren-edition-launch-price-india/) last year), but the company has improved the charging speed with the use of graphene in the components.

OnePlus claims that **Warp Charge 30T is 23% faster** than its last-gen Warp Charge technology, which should completely juice up the **3,800mAh battery** onboard in just around 55 minutes.
