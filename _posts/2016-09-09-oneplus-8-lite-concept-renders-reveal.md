After a gap of 5 years, OnePlus may be all set to get back into the mid-range market next year with the launch of an all-new mid-range smartphone. This will be the company’s first mid-range phone since the OnePlus X, which launched earlier in 2015. The report comes from the generally-reliable tipster, _@OnLeaks_, who says that it might be marketed as the OnePlus 8 Lite rather than OnePlus X2.  

91Mobiles [published](https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-8-lite-renders-design-punch-hole-display-camera/) a few CAD-based concepts renders of the upcoming device, revealing a flat display with a center-aligned punch-hole at the top for the selfie-cam up-front. You can also see a rectangular camera housing at the back with dual-cameras and what seems to be an LED flash. Next to the main camera housing, there’s another tiny cutout for what might house a ToF (Time of Flight) sensor.  

  

According to the report, OnePlus 8 Lite is also expected to feature a USB Type-C port and display of around 6.4- or 6.5-inches in size. It will retain OnePlus’ trademark Alert Slider, but will give the 3.5mm audio port a miss. It will also reportedly get a curved-glass rear panel in a blue gradient finish. What’s more, the lack of a physical fingerprint scanner on the back may suggest that OnePlus 8 Lite might ship with an in-display sensor.  

  

Do note that this is the first time we’re hearing about a possible OnePlus 8 Lite, and even though it comes from a reliable source, we suggest you take it with a grain of salt unless there’s any confirmation from other sources. Even if the device is in development, which could be possible because of the [recently announced Snapdragon 765 chipset](https://beebom.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-765-brings-5g-support-to-mid-range-android-phones/), these are very early reports and much could change between now and a possible launch next year. So, would you want to see OnePlus launch a new mid-range smartphone? Let us know in the comments below.
