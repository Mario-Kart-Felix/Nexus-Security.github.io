OnePlus’ upcoming mid-range smartphone, the [OnePlus 8 Lite](https://beebom.com/oneplus-8-lite-renders-surface-online/), is rumored to be launched later this year. We have earlier seen CAD renders for this device appear online but now a new set of images, which are said to be of the smartphone’s dummy unit, reveal that the OnePlus 8 Lite will ship with a triple-camera setup instead of the dual-camera module.  

OnePlus 8 Lite will be the second offering in OnePlus’ rather short stint at building a mid-range smartphone. It will follow the OnePlus X, which was launched back in 2015 before the company [ditched the idea](https://beebom.com/oneplus-x2-fake-news/) of mid-range handsets.  

Meanwhile, as can be seen from the images below, apart from the obvious change in the camera department, the new photos show a design that’s eerily similar to what we saw in the leaked render of the supposed OnePlus 8 Lite from last month. The images, [published by SlashLeaks](http://www.slashleaks.com/l/oneplus-8-lite-dummy-leak), show a whole stack of smartphones packed neatly in a transparent plastic container, including a blue one that’s said to be the OnePlus 8 Lite.

Alongside the leaked images, we also have a new CAD render of the device, thanks to the serial tipster, _@OnLeaks_. The render, updated with the additional image sensor following the leaked live photos, now shows a triple-cam setup at the back and a punch-hole display upfront. What’s notable is the presence of the alert slider that has become one of the most beloved features of [OnePlus smartphones](https://beebom.com/ces-2020-oneplus-concept-one-official-teaser-shows-invisible-cameras/) ever since it was introduced aboard the OnePlus 2 back in 2015.

With flagship OnePlus smartphones increasingly being priced higher than their preceding generations, the OnePlus 8 Lite is likely the culmination of the company’s plans to offer something at a more affordable price-point to address the needs of more customers. While its specs, features, availability, and pricing details are not immediately known, it will very likely be a mid-range device with an affordable price-tag. It will be interesting to see if it will still offer the complete OnePlus experience in terms of its software or not.
