OnePlus is apparently planning to launch its next-gen flagship smartphones earlier than usual. According to leakster, Ishaan Agarwal _(@ishanagarwal24)_, both the [OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro](https://beebom.com/oneplus-8-wireless-charging-support-expected/) will be announced late March or early April instead of May, which is when the company typically launches its devices. Interestingly, even the [rumored OnePlus 8 Lite](https://beebom.com/oneplus-8-lite-new-live-images-surface/) might be announced on the same day, although, that’s not confirmed just yet.  

Agarwal further says that both the OnePlus 8 and the 8 Pro may come in a green version, but do note that even the OnePlus 7T was rumored to be launched in an Olive Green avatar, although, that never quite materialized. Either way, there’s no word currently on whether the OnePlus 8 Lite will also have a Green option of some description, so we might have to wait a while to figure that out. Meanwhile, there’s no new info on any of the three devices, but we’ll hopefully get more details in the coming coming days.

Just to recap, multiple leaks, rumors and speculations over the past few weeks have revealed many key details about the upcoming OnePlus 8 lineup, including the existence of a mid-range OnePlus 8 Lite. As for the expected flagship, the OnePlus 8 Pro, a [Geekbench listing](https://beebom.com/oneplus-8-pro-geekbench-spotted/) a couple of weeks ago seemingly revealed some of its key tech specs, including the Snapdragon 865 SoC (originally developed under codename ‘Project Kona’), up to 12GB of RAM and Android 10 out-of-the-box.  

Earlier rumors suggested that the [OnePlus 8 Pro may sport a quad-camera setup at the back](https://beebom.com/oneplus-8-pro-renders-quad-cam-punch-hole/) and a punch-hole design upfront. It is also rumored to feature a 6.65-inch panel with 120Hz refresh rate, 5G connectivity and a 4,500mAh battery with 50W fast-charging, which should make it one of the fastest-charging smartphones available commercially after the Reno Ace with Oppo’s [65W SuperVOOC charging](https://beebom.com/oppo-65w-charging-tech-unveiled/). That, however, may change with Nubia’s upcoming [Red Magic 5G, which promises to bring 80W fast-charging](https://beebom.com/nubia-80w-fast-charging-tech-teased/) to consumer smartphones.
