![](https://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/OnePlus-7T-Pro_fonearena-7-1024x651.jpg) OnePlus is the latest company to join Wireless Power Consortium, a group of companies for developing and promoting the Qi wireless charging standard. This indicates that future OnePlus will have Qi wireless charging, and this should be the OnePlus 8 series expected to launch in mid-2020. OnePlus is now listed on the WPC’s member list, however, it is not clear when they joined. Joining the consortium is a requirement for creating devices that use Qi wireless charging. OnePlus' current or past phones only had support for wired fast charging with the latest fast charging tech being Warp Charge 30T, and the company even denied wireless charging during the OnePlus 7 launch. “OnePlus charging is one of the best. Wireless charging is far inferior,” said the company's CEO Pete Lau last year. OnePlus recently introduced Quad HD+ OLED ‘Fluid Display’ with a refresh rate of 120Hz, 240Hz touch sampling rate, 10-bit HDR support, and is expected to be used in the OnePlus 8 Pro. Source
