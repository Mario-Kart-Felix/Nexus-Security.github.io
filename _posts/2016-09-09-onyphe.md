ONYPHE is a search engine for open-source and cyber threat intelligence data collected by crawling various sources available on the Internet or by listening to Internet background noise. ONYPHE does correlate this information with data gathered by performing active Internet scanning for connected devices. It then normalizes information and makes it available via an API and its query language.
