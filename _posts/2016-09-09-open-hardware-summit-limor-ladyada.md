It’s open hardware month, and each day we’ll post up an open-source hardware/software story, video, article, something we want to see open-sourced, upcoming events, lots of different things all month long that have something to do with open source.

To kick it off, here is a video from the first Open hardware summit with our Limor “Ladyada” Fried keynoting, back in 2010 ([video](https://youtu.be/Ca1dbM582Sc)), still a great talk and relevant almost 10 years later.

October is [open-source hardware month](https://ohm.oshwa.org/)! Every single day in October we’ll be posting up some open-source stories from the last decade (and more!) about open-source hardware, open-source software, and beyond!

Have an open-source hardware (or software) success story? A person, company, or project to celebrate? An open-source challenge? Post up here in the comments or email [opensource@adafruit.com](mailto:opensource@adafruit.com), we’ll be looking for, and using the tag [#OHM2019](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OHM2019&src=typed_query&f=live) online as well!
