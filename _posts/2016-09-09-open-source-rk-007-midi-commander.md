The fine folks at [Retrokits](https://www.retrokits.com/) have created a new bit of open source gear called the **RK-007 MIDI Commander**:

> Not your average number; This one is a little device to hack into your MIDI Setup. We made it with minimal amount of ( – cheap & easy to find – ) parts and soldering and devised a smart use of the keypad for easy and versatile use. It could be a handy tool to keep in your MIDI setup – and perhaps even be a good starting point for other firmware you find even more useful: This one you can build in Q-Style!

Using the keypad and knob, you can use it to select MIDI channels, send out Program Change, Note On/Off, Start/Stop, MIDI Panic, and more.

You can find the [project files here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ApOp4-7D9san-JZ1L5lHoujutrMEAIey), including wiring diagram, Arduino code, and 3D printed case models.

I’m looking forward to building a modified version with an ItsyBitsy or Feather!
