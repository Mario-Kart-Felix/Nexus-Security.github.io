October is [open-source hardware month](https://ohm.oshwa.org/)! Every single day in October we’ll be posting up some open-source stories from the last decade (and more!) about open-source hardware, open-source software, and beyond!

Have an open-source hardware (or software) success story? A person, company, or project to celebrate? An open-source challenge? Post up here in the comments or email [opensource@adafruit.com](mailto:opensource@adafruit.com), we’ll be looking for, and using the tag [#OHM2019](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OHM2019&src=typed_query&f=live) online as well! Check out [all the events](https://t.co/HN5EvWISdN?amp=1) going on here!
