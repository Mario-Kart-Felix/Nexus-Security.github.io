> The TinyUSB open source cross-platform USB stack, designed specifically for embedded devices, is set to gain a new feature in a future release: support for the eptri tri-FIFO USB device, offering 16 IN and 16 OUT endpoints without consuming excessive resources.
> 
> Supported on a range of microcontrollers, the TinyUSB stack aims to offer memory- and thread-safe USB control on resource-constrained devices without using dynamic allocation. The stack is set to get a shiny new function in its next release, courtesy of a pull request from Sean Cross to add support for a tri-FIFO device mode: eptri.
