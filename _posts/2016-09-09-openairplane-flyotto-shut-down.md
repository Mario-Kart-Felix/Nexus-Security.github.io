Rakic notes that he’d left his “day job” in mid-2013 when the beta platform for OpenAirplane launched, and it has been his daily raison d’etre ever since. “Obsession is the level of commitment,” he said in an interview with _Flying_. Co-Founder Adam Fast was “the smarts behind the curtain,” while Rakic provided the “hustle” he gained fame for around the GA industry. "This was my B school,” he said, and he reflected on how much he has learned since pitching the concept at AeroInnovate at EAA AirVenture in 2011.

Partners and customers alike have expressed regret. “Like Apollo 13, it was a successful failure,” was one comment from a customer.
