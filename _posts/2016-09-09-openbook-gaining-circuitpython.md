Adafruit is a huge fan of Joey Castillo’s OpenBook project: an open source eReader using a huge ePaper/eInk display. Based on a SAMD51 processor, Joey’s [working on](https://twitter.com/josecastillo/status/1215388022692372480) [CircuitPython programming](https://circuitpython.org/) support:

> Today’s second project: #CircuitPython support for the #OpenBook! It’s not 100% there yet — I have yet to get the screen working as board.DISPLAY — but I can create it in main and it “just works” with @tannewt’s IL0398 driver. This feels like a big step.

The Twitter thread has the architect of [CircuitPytho](https://circuitpython.org/)n, Scott Shawcroft, volunteering to help. Part of the mantra of CircuitPython: code plus community (and of course open source).

See [Joey’s GitHub repo](https://github.com/joeycastillo/circuitpython/tree/openbook/ports/atmel-samd/boards/openbook) for the code so far.
