That's a lot of commits by a lot of amazing people. (\*) by one measure. Since the repository is so large and old, there are a variety of quirks including ChangeLog missing entries and branches not converable to other repo forms, so measuring is hard. If you think you've got a great way of measuring, don't be so sure of yourself -- you may have overcounted or undercounted. **\[[prev in list](https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&m=157056198012912&w=2)\] \[next in list\] \[prev in thread\] \[next in thread\] **
