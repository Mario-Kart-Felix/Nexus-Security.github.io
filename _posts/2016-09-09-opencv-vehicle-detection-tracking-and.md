Great new tutorial from Adrian Rosebrock up on [PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/12/02/opencv-vehicle-detection-tracking-and-speed-estimation/).

> In this tutorial, you will learn how to use OpenCV and Deep Learning to detect vehicles in video streams, track them, and apply speed estimation to detect the MPH/KPH of the moving vehicle.
> 
> This tutorial is inspired by PyImageSearch readers who have emailed me asking for speed estimation computer vision solutions.
> 
> As pedestrians taking the dog for a walk, escorting our kids to school, or marching to our workplace in the morning, we’ve all experienced unsafe, fast-moving vehicles operated by inattentive drivers that nearly mow us down.
> 
> Many of us live in apartment complexes or housing neighborhoods where ignorant drivers disregard safety and zoom by, going way too fast.
