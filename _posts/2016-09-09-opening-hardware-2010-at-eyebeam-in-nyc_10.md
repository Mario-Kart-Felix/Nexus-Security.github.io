After the meeting, STUFF happened. Within a few months there was a draft of the Open-source hardware definition ([June 2010](https://freedomdefined.org/OSHW)), and lots of folks started getting involved in the electronic’s industry. Hardware files and code started to get released more since it was define better as to what “open-source hardware” was and was not. CADSoft EAGLE (now owned by AutoDesk, agreed to do an XML export after many of us contacted them and outlined why it would be helpful for open-source hardware makers([October 2010](https://www.element14.com/community/thread/5589)).

I do not think open-source hardware would have taken off as much as it has over the last decade had it not been for this specific meeting and everyone who attended.

On the Eyebeam site the [project/event is no longer listed](http://www.eyebeam.org/projects/open-hardware) and [it’s not on the Wayback Machine either](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.eyebeam.org/projects/open-hardware).

HOWEVER! I knew this was going to be a historic meeting so I scanned the paper handout, it’s above. Turns out a scan of a paper thing can last longer than a lot of website pages from 10 years ago.

There IS a [Flickr photo group](https://www.flickr.com/groups/1363786@N20/pool/) that has some of the photos, include the group photo above!

October is [open-source hardware month](https://ohm.oshwa.org/)! Every single day in October we’ll be posting up some open-source stories from the last decade (and more!) about open-source hardware, open-source software, and beyond!

Have an open-source hardware (or software) success story? A person, company, or project to celebrate? An open-source challenge? Post up here in the comments or email [opensource@adafruit.com](mailto:opensource@adafruit.com), we’ll be looking for, and using the tag [#OHM2019](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OHM2019&src=typed_query&f=live) online as well! Check out [all the events](https://ohm.oshwa.org/events/) going on here!
