ColorOS 6 was introduced in November 2018 that brought new logo, new wallpapers and icons as well as ultra clear video, GameBoost 2.0, short video, gaming, AI and security features. realme already confirmed that its smartphones will get ColorOS 7.0 exclusive version that will offer near stock Android experience. This will likely be based on Android 10 that will roll out next year. We should know more details once it goes official in a couple of weeks. Source
