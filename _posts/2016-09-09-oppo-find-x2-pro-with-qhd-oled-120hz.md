![](https://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/OPPO-Find-X2-Q1-2020.jpg) OPPO Find X which was launched back in 2018 was a bold attempt from the company with the motorized dual rear camera setup and was quite successful too. While there was no information on the successor for quite some time now, it is likely to change now as the Find X2 Pro has received BIS certification, indicating an imminent launch. OPPO Find X2 Pro (CPH-2025) has appeared on the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) in Thailand and has got the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) certification. So, we can expect the India launch soon and there are chances that OPPO could launch this alongside the Reno3 Pro in February. Coming to the specifications, there are not many details known yet, but a recent post by Brian Shen, Vice President of OPPO read, "2K and 120Hz go along with 65W SuperVOOC", indicating that the Find X2 Pro and Find X2 will sport a 2K 120Hz display. Furthermore, these will feature 65W Super VOOC charging which is said to charge the smartphone fully in 35 minutes. Hopefully, more information will surface soon, and we should know then.
