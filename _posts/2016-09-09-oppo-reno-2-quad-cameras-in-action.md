Launched earlier this year, OPPO Reno 10x Zoom was one of the most likeable phones in my opinion. It offered you flagship-grade hardware, performance, and cameras at a very reasonable price as compared to its competitors. Well, OPPO Reno 2 [arrived recently](https://beebom.com/oppo-reno-2-launched-india/) with the Snapdragon 730G gaming-centric chipset, bezel-less design, shark-fin rising camera, and of course, quad-cameras in tow.  

OPPO has been trendsetter over the past few years, perking up its smartphone offerings with innovative new features. OPPO Reno 2 and its quad-cameras are no exception and that’s exactly what we are here to explore today.  

OPPO Reno 2: Camera Specs
-------------------------

  

Before we take a look at the different camera samples, here’s a rundown of the camera specifications. OPPO Reno 2 is aligned with the ongoing trend and comes packed with a vertically-aligned quad-camera module on the rear. It includes a **primary 48MP (f/1.7) Sony IMX586 sensor**, coupled with **a 13MP (f/2.4) telephoto lens** with 2x optical zoom capability, **an 8MP ultra-wide lens** with 116-degree field-of-view (and a nifty trick up its sleeve, which we will explore down below), and finally **a 2MP mono lens** for capturing a larger amount of detail.  

So, without further ado, let’s see the OPPO Reno 2’s quad-cameras in action. We’ll check out the different camera modes and samples captured using them right here:

### 1\. 48MP Primary Camera Shots

  

Starting off, we took the OPPO Reno 2 out for a spin and captured pictures in different daylight and lowlight settings. You can see in the images attached below that the OPPO Reno 2 delivers some excellent results with ample details, good dynamic range, and an overall pleasant result that’s worth sharing on social media.  

  

### 2\. Ultra Wide Angle and Macro Shots

  

Apart from a 48MP primary sensor, OPPO Reno 2 comes equipped with an ultra-wide-angle lens that can surely help you change how one perceives an image as compared to the standard wide-angle shot. One of the main concerns with ultra-wide-angle lenses on phones is color accuracy and a fish-eye effect. Well, Reno 2 takes care of both, providing you pictures with good contrast minus the weird contouring effect on the edges.

Ultra-wide Angle  

  

Well, there’s no doubt about the fact that ultra-wide-angle lens on the Reno 2 opens up even more possibilities for the users. It not only offers you a fresh new perspective, but also hands you the power to get up-close with the subject. Yeah, **you can also capture macro shots using the ultra-wide-angle lens on the Reno 2**.  

As for the image quality, well, you can see that the samples below are crisp with a good amount of detail and accurate color reproduction. I’m quite impressed with these macro shots and intend to use this feature on the regular.

  
  

  
  

### 3\. 20X Zoom Shots

  

One of my favorite features on the OPPO Reno 10x Zoom, [which I used quite extensively earlier this year](https://beebom.com/oppo-reno-official/), was the ability to click photos at 10x hybrid and 60x digital zoom. Well, OPPO Reno 2 makes this stunning feature more accessible and I love it.  

OPPO Reno 2 doesn’t include a periscope-cum-telephoto lens, so 10x hybrid zoom photos are out of the question. But, the 13MP telephoto lens provides you **2x optical zoom, 5x hybrid zoom, and 20x digital zoom capability**. I’ve been toying with this feature for a few days now, so check out some 20x zoom shots captured by me:

So, as seen in the images above, you cannot read the text on the signage far away, but OPPO Reno 2 lets you get close to it without physically moving from your spot. This is an awesome feature to have on a smartphone as it could be used while recording videos as well.  

### 4\. Portrait Mode Shots

  

Almost every smartphone out there, even sub-Rs. 8,000 devices come baked with the portrait mode feature, so how could it be missing on a high-end flagship. OPPO Reno 2 features a “16MP shark-fin pop-up selfie camera module” and well, you can click some amazing portrait mode shots using it. The smartphone is able to capture a lot of detail, sharp pictures with good edge detection and a natural background blur.  

  

### 5\. Ultra Steady Videos

  

One of my favorite features of OPPO Reno 2 will have to be the ultra steady videos. Man, the videos captured using this smartphone are super smooth and it feels like you used a gimbal to keep the phone stable. But, that’s not the case in the samples attached below, where we were running while recording both the 4K/30fps and 1080p/60fps videos.  

  

  

The ultra steady video mode is quite impressive and has been **made possible thanks to OIS and EIS** both being present on the smartphone. If we were to comment on the video quality, well, it’s very good and likeable. The videos are color accurate, sharp and detailed, free of any focus issues, and the audio is excellent too.  

### 6\. Portrait Videos

  

Another amazing feature of OPPO Reno 2 will have to be the **ability to capture portrait videos**. Yes, you can not only click photos with a blurred background but capture videos with the same blurred effect – to only further highlight the subject. Check out a couple of sample videos we captured with the Reno 2:

  
  

  

  

  

Well, you can see in the videos here that the edge-detection is excellent, especially since one of these videos was captured in artificial light. The blur also looks natural and not too strong, which is great. This feature could be a boon for fledgling YouTubers, TikTok stars, and other content creators, who would like to have a DSLR-like bokeh in their videos.  

### 7\. Ultra Dark Mode

  

OPPO Reno 2 also sports an “ultra dark mode” that allows you to capture some stunning photos in low-light conditions. It does not just bump up the brightness of the shots, but also uses AI noise reduction to perk up the details and sharpness of the subjects. This is another useful and nifty feature that should allow you to click pictures at clubs, concerts, and architecture at night. Check out the comparison between a standard and night mode shot right here:

### 8\. Other Features

  

Apart from the slew of features that we have demoed above, OPPO Reno 2 comes packed with even more capabilities such as Sound Focus and 20x Zoom videos. While the former amplifies the subject’s audio on zooming in and out, the latter lets you use the 20x zoom feature in videos as well – but it’s restricted to 1080p/30fps, which is okay!  

  

  

Well, that’s pretty much everything you need to know about the Reno 2’s quad-cameras. You now have a good idea of the different camera features and how they perform, which means you can surely appreciate the photography prowess of this phone. To sum it up, I would say that the OPPO Reno 2 is a compelling mid-range camera phone that would not disappoint you. Do you think so too? Let us know in the comments below.
