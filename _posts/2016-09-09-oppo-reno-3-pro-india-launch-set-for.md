Oppo has been teasing the launch of its next Reno smartphone, [the Reno 3 Pro](https://beebom.com/oppo-reno-3-pro-5g-launched-specs-price-availability/), for the past few days. We have already learned that it will bring a major upgrade on the selfie camera front but didn’t know when exactly we will be able to get our hands on it. Well, the Chinese giant has today confirmed that **Oppo Reno 3 Pro will launch in India on 2nd March**.  

Oppo confirmed the launch date via an official tweet, along with a teaser starring its brand ambassador, i.e. Bollywood actor Ranbir Kapoor. It has also created a [landing page](https://www.oppo.com/in/smartphone-reno3-pro/) for the Reno 3 Pro launch in India. The device was [first unveiled](https://beebom.com/oppo-reno-3-pro-5g-launched-specs-price-availability/) in China back in December with the [Snapdragon 765G chipset](https://beebom.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-765-brings-5g-support-to-mid-range-android-phones/), 5G support, and a punch-hole selfie camera on the left.  

  

The highlight of the Reno 3 Pro in India, if you haven’t guessed already, will be the 44MP dual punch-hole camera. You will get a 44MP primary camera and a 2MP depth sensor in tow here. The company has upgraded its offering for India to stand tall against [Poco X2](https://beebom.com/poco-x2-launched-india/) (rebranded Redmi K30) and [Realme X50](https://beebom.com/realme-x50-launched-china-specs-features-price/), which also sport a dual punch-hole design.  

On the landing page, Oppo touts that Reno 3 Pro is the **world’s first phone to sport a 44MP dual punch-hole camera**. It then adds, _“Capture the world with flawless clarity. Introducing Dual Punch Hole Camera in OPPO Reno 3 Pro. It helps create dream-like images with Dual Lens Bokeh. The Dual Front Camera provides Binocular Bokeh Effect by sharpening the edges and producing background gradient.”_  

We’re not sure if Oppo is planning to make any more changes to the device. Otherwise, it could be the first Snapdragon 765G-powered smartphone to make its way to India. You’ll also get a 6.5-inch FHD+ AMOLED display, a quad rear-camera system with a 48MP Sony IMX586 primary sensor, and Android 10-based ColorOS 7.
