It was dubbed Oppo Reno Ace and we’ve since been seeing tidbits of information about this smartphone leak online. Oppo itself had been teasing the main features of Reno Ace including a 90Hz display panel, a quad-camera setup, Snapdragon 855+, and more.

Oppo Reno Ace: Specs and Features
---------------------------------

  

Starting with the design, Oppo Reno Ace features a curved glass build with a gradient pattern that looks cool and changes color when light falls on it at different angles. The device features a quad-camera setup on the rear, with the Oppo branding, and an in-display fingerprint up-front.  

Oppo Reno Ace features a **6.5-inch Full-HD+ AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate and 135Hz touch sampling rate**, which is the same as the OnePlus 7T. You still have a small waterdrop notch up-top, housing the 16MP selfie camera.

This display boasts a 1080x2400p resolution and 19.5:9 aspect ratio, along with 100% DCI-P3 and HDR 10+ support. It even has a peak brightness of 1000 nits, which would make it easily legible under direct sunlight.  

Under the hood, **Oppo Reno Ace is powered by the latest Snapdragon 855 Plus chipset**, paired with up to 12GB of LPDDR4x RAM and up to 256GB of UFS 3.0 storage. This is backed by a triple layer cooling system, which packs a multi-layer graphite heat sink, copper vapor chamber, and a new composite carbon fiber later.  

This smartphone **runs Android 9 Pie-based ColorOS 6.1** out-of-the-box, with added Turbo modes to perk up the performance. You will also get NFC support, LinkBoost for better Wi-Fi connectivity, and dual stereo speakers with Hi-Res Audio and Dolby Atmos support.

In the camera department, the Oppo Reno Ace hosts a vertically-aligned quad-camera setup with a 48MP Sony IMX586 primary sensor. This is coupled with a 13MP telephoto sensor, an 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens, and a 2MP depth sensor to offer you not just the variety in perspectives but also enable you to click some crisp portrait shots. Reno Ace also brings the ‘Super Steady’ video mode that will help you click stable videos in 1080p @ 60fps. It supports up to 4K/60fps video recording.  

Oppo Reno Ace **comes equipped with a 4,000mAh battery**, which may seem measly when compared to the beastly specs we have seen above, but this is company’s first phone to arrive with the new 65W SuperVOOC charging technology. This means you can completely top-up your phone’s battery in just 25 minutes, which is mind-boggling.
