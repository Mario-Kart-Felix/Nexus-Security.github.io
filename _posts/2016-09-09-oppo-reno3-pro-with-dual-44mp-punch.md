While both the smartphones went on sale earlier this month, the next smartphone in this series - OPPO Reno3 Pro with dual-punch hole display has surfaced now. According to the image posted by Mrwhosetheboss, OPPO Reno3 Pro sports 44MP punch-hole front camera and is the world's first smartphone to sport the same, and the secondary camera is said to be 2MP depth sensor. In comparison, the Reno3 Pro 5G sports a single punch-hole front camera to the left and the Reno3 5G sports a water-drop notch display. The rest of the specifications of the smartphone are not known yet, but it is expected to be similar to the Reno3 Pro 5G. Similarly, there is no information on the launch date and availability yet. But we should know more information in the coming days. It could come with Snapdragon 730G,  48MP + 8MP + 13MP telephoto lens, In-display fingerprint sensor and dual speakers, similar to the Reno3 Pro 5G version. It is expected to launch in India sometime in February. Source
