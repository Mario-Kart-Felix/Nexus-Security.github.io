Almost every phone maker will be [adopting the next-gen 5G network technology](https://beebom.com/check-all-5g-supported-regions-across-world/) in 2020. We will start to see the initial wave of 5G-capable Android phones later this month. Oppo will also be joining in on the fun soon with the launch of the [Reno 3 series](https://beebom.com/oppo-reno-3-5g-supprot-launch-december/). But, before it unveils the next Reno device, Oppo will hold the _inaugural INNO DAY 2019 conference_ in Shenzhen, China on December 10.  

The Chinese giant organized the first-ever INNO DAY conference last year but it was not open to the media and general public. It was an internal technology exhibition that was used to showcase Oppo’s _“R&D capacity and breakthroughs across various fields.”_ Oppo also invited industry experts to hold in-depth discussions about future technologies.  

The format will be pretty much the same for the company’s [INNO DAY 2019](https://www.oppo.com/en/about-us/press/oppo-to-showcases-technology-vision-at-the-inaugural-oppo-inno-day/), except for that it’s now open to global media, analysts, industry partners, and the masses. You’re going to see the company demo its cutting-edge technologies and talks to the _“industry experts, partners, and opinion leaders to shed a light on the enormous changes 5G will bring.”_  

If you’re interested in checking out the schedule and other conference-related info, then you can visit the INNO DAY website [right here](https://events.oppo.com/en/innoday/?lang=en).
