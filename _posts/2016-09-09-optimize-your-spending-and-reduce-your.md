**Three-Step Financial Freedom**
--------------------------------

When your schedule is packed, budgeting can slip pretty low on the priority list. However, the main reason why most of us overspend is because we simply don’t know what we can afford.

Truebill helps you take control of your financial life without spending hours hunched over a calculator. Available on iOS and Android, the free app connects to your bank and credit card accounts (using bank-level 256-bit SSL encryption) to track your income and expenses.

The data is presented in one simple dashboard, helping you gain an overview of your finances. Truebill automatically categorizes every transaction, so you can see where your money is going.

But that’s not all. Truebill lets you create savings goals, and the app will tell you how much you can spend. The app can also help you lower your bills by finding cheaper alternatives for your cell phone, cable and security. You can even monitor your subscriptions and cut the ones you don’t need.
