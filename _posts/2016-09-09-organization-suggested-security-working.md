\- Just put this together to get some feedback on what others thought.  
  
These are suggested/recommended as potential organization "Working Groups" and/or "Tiger Teams" that could be helpful in order to facilitate organizational security and compliance goals. Some of these could be/should probably be ongoing and standing while others might be periodic and just spun up as needed.
