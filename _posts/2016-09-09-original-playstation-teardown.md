> The [original PlayStation is turning 25 years old](https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20970458/playstation-anniversary-ps5-ps4-plus-games-ps3-ps2-25th-sony), and to celebrate, _iFixit_ is turning its screwdrivers and plastic pry bars to the retro console in [one of its signature teardowns](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FSony%2BPlayStation%2BTeardown%2F128089%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3D120319_PR_PlayStation1%2520Teardown%26utm_content%3D120319_PR_PlayStation1%2520Teardown%2BCID_a04604bdc602b6e2b8ec1b749744813a%26utm_source%3DCampaignMonitor%26utm_term%3Dtore%2520one%2520down&referrer=theverge.com&xcust=xid:fr1575415283839ice). There aren’t too many surprises hiding inside the 25-year-old device, but the teardown is still neat for a couple of reasons.

> First off, it’s wild to see just how much more advanced our current consoles are compared to these earlier models. As _iFixit_ points out, the standard, non-Pro PlayStation 4 has 50 times the processing power and 4,000 times more RAM than the original PlayStation — to the point that the original doesn’t even need a fan to cool down the internals.
