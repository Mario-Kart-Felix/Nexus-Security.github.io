Catalan photographer Xavi Bou captures images of the routes that birds take during migration. Via [the artists website!](http://www.xavibou.com/index.php/project/about-xavi-bou/)

> TECHNOLOGY, SCIENCE AND CREATIVITY COMBINE TO CREATE EVOCATIVE IMAGES WHICH SHOW THE SENSUALITY AND BEAUTY OF THE BIRD’S MOVEMENTS AND WHICH ARE, AT THE SAME TIME, CLUES FOR THOSE WISHING TO IDENTIFY OR RECOGNIZE THEM.
> 
> In Ornitographies, the skill envied by men, the long lasting shared yearning of flying, is presented to us, extending our visual perception.
> 
> Art and science walk hand in hand to create images, which are no longer a single portrait of reality but become a witness of the instants that, for a moment, were past, present and future all at once.
> 
> ORNITOGRAPHIES IS A BALANCE BETWEEN ART AND SCIENCE; A NATURE-BASED DISSEMINATION PROJECT AND A VISUAL POETRY EXERCISE BUT ABOVE ALL, AN INVITATION TO PERCEIVE THE WORLD WITH THE SAME CURIOUS AND INNOCENT LOOK OF THE CHILD WE ONCE WERE.
