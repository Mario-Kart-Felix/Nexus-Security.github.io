OsMA AI Terrarium is an art project created by multimedia Artist [Camila Magrane](https://www.camilamagrane.com/osma). By following and liking the instagram representation of the AI you help keep the physical (terrarium) alive.

> OsMa is an interactive sculpture that explores internet identity and the psychological dependence of a social network.
> 
> She is an Artificial Intelligence with a terrarium body. Though her intellect is composed of computer parts and complex algorithms she behaves like any other modern social being with a motive to be accepted and “liked.”
> 
> OsMA interacts with the world by maintaining her own instagram account. The interactions she has with her social media network impact her overall mood and physical well-being. Every time Osma receives a new “like” or “follower” her mood is enhanced, allowing for her body’s terrarium to stay lit and for drops of water to be released in the plant soil.
