Widely regarded as the creator of the very best professional image manipulation software that money can buy (think [Photoshop](https://beebom.com/photoshop-ipad-psd-support-layers/), Lightroom, Illustrator), US tech firm, Adobe, is now prepping to release a mobile camera app called **Adobe Photoshop Camera** that will come with **built-in photo-editing tools**. According to the company, the app will use AI to automatically apply lenses and filters to photos even before the photos are taken. It will bring ‘insta-worthy’ lenses and effects to apply before or after the shot, said the company.  

_“It’s really easy to swap them in and out, so you don’t have to worry about changing your mind. And you can keep your favorites to use again and again”_, said Adobe in an [official post](https://theblog.adobe.com/introducing-adobe-photoshop-camera/). According to Abhay Parasnis, the executive VP and Chief Technology Officer at the company, _“We built Photoshop Camera as a Sensei-first app on our journey to expand our focus to deliver creative tools for everyone”_.  

  

As alluded to Parasnis in his ‘Sensei-first’ comment, the camera app comes with integrated Adobe Sensei – the company’s AI platform that it says will enable the app to instantly recognize the subject in the photo and provide recommendations. It will also _“automatically apply sophisticated, unique features at the moment of capture (i.e. portraits, landscapes, selfies, food shots), while always preserving an original shot”_, he said.  

The app will also allow users to access a curated feed of lenses made by well-known artists and influencers, including Billie Eilish, who collaborated with Adobe to create _“some really cool limited-edition lenses inspired by her songs and music videos”_.  

Adobe is aiming to launch the Photoshop Camera app in early 2020, and interested individuals can [sign-up](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-camera.html#) for the limited preview on both Android and iOS.
