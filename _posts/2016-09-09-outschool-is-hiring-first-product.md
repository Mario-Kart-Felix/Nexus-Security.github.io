Outschool's mission is to inspire kids to love learning. We believe the best way to do that is by linking learning to kids’ interests (make it fun!) and giving them the autonomy to pick their own path. We provide small group classes that meet over live video chat where learners are connected with teachers and classmates who share their interests. These classes are offered through our marketplace and conducted on our remote learning platform.

  

We're growing fast: over 70,000 learners have enrolled in classes, and we're doubling our team this year. We're an experienced team with past accomplishments at Airbnb, Square, Uber, Udemy, Amazon, Google, and many startups. We came together because we wanted to make a difference in education, and saw the opportunity to empower learners, teachers, and parents. Now we have a successful, fast-growing business and recently

We’re looking for a first product manager to build our product function from the ground up and lead it through growth. We need your help to define and execute a product roadmap that takes us from early product-market fit to mainstream adoption. This first product role requires a unique blend of leadership and individual execution. You may be a senior leader looking to get hands-on again at an earlier stage company. Or you may be an early-stage specialist looking for an inspiring mission where you can have more impact.

  

Outschool is an equal opportunity employer. We view diversity as a moral imperative and a competitive advantage. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We plan and structure our interviews to directly assess skills and experience. Currently, our team is 47% female and 27% born outside the US.
