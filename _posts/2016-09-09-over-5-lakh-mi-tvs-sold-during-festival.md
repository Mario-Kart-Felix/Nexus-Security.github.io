Mi TV was the highest-selling TV on Amazon and Flipkart during the shopping festival, the company said.

In a short span of time of three months since inception, we became the #1 Smart TV brand in India and have continued our streak for five consecutive quarters”_, Eshwar Nilakantan, Category Lead – Mi TV, Xiaomi India, said in a statement.  

As part of its plans to consolidate its position as the premier smart TV vendor in India, the company last month unveiled a bunch of [new Mi 4X smart TVs](https://beebom.com/mi-tv-4x-launched-india-price-specs-features/), along with [a water purifier](https://beebom.com/xiaomi-launches-mi-smart-water-purifier-in-india-priced-at-rs-11999/) and the [Mi Smart Band 4](https://beebom.com/mi-band-4-launched-india-price-specs-features/) in the country.

The new Mi TVs feature a redesigned version of the company’s proprietary ‘PatchWall’ interface based on Android 9 Pie, and have [built-in Netflix and Amazon Prime](https://beebom.com/mi-tv-pro-india-netflix/) streaming services. The company is also [expected to launch its Mi TV 5 lineup](https://beebom.com/xiaomi-mi-tv-5-october/) in the country before the end of this year.
