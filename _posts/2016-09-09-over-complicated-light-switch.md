> Found even more light switches in the house that were too utilitarian and functional. “Nay”, said the homeowner. “That shall not do”
> 
> I took out a lot of the slop from what’s illustrated in the video, shouldn’t wobble around as much now.
> 
> Only part that needs support is the crank\_supports.stl, the rest shall print just fine without any. No additional hardware needed, use your existing wall switch cover.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
