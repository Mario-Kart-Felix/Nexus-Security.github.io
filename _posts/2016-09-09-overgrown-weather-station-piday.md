Redditor [RamonesRazor](https://www.reddit.com/user/RamonesRazor/) shared this weather station converted from an old tv. The overgrown plant effect creates an awesome look.

Via [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/f6bp88/overgrown_weather_station_using_a_pi3_and_an_old/):

> Fun little project I finished up last night.
> 
> 1.  Raspberry Pi 3
> 2.  3.5″ LCD screen
> 3.  Old mini TV I got for free from a local “Buy Nothing” group.
> 4.  Fake moss & plants from a local craft store.
> 
> Instructions:
> 
> 1.  Fresh install of Raspbian 10 (buster) on the Pi, attach screen and config
> 2.  Installed PiWeatherRock, small Python program that provides the GUI
> 3.  Signed up for DarkSky.net, which allows 1,000 free daily API calls to the weather service
> 4.  Added my API key and location into the config file
> 5.  Mounted the Pi & screen inside the TV shell.
> 6.  Decorate! Still in progress, might make it even more overgrown.
