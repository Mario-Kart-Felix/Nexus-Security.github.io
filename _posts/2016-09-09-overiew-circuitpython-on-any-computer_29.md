Powerful computers can now use the power of CircuitPython libraries. This guide will show you how to use an FT232H to connect to I2C and SPI sensors and breakouts from your desktop PC running Windows, Mac OSX, or Linux. The FT232H also allows for general purpose digital input and output (GPIO) for things like buttons and LEDs.

The cool part about this is that you can then use any of the CircuitPython Libraries that have been written for the numerous sensors and breakouts â€“ [learn.adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-any-computer-with-ft232h/overiew).
