A new limited-time event for [Overwatch](https://www.gamespot.com/overwatch/) lets you earn your doctorate. The Mercy's Recall Challenge event runs from November 12 through December 2 and ties in with the [short story Valkyrie](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/x3/X38BR3N7HTDP1573261672394.pdf), which Blizzard released this week. Participating in the event can earn you some cosmetic rewards, including a legendary "Dr. Ziegler" skin for Mercy.

This isn't a surprise, as the Dr. Ziegler skin was showcased at the end of the short story itself. It features the familiar support character with a lab coat and stethoscope, but still sporting her futuristic Valkyrie boots.

To earn the new skin, you just have to win a set number of games during the event period, which will also earn you sprays. For even more rewards, you can also watch Twitch streamers during the event period to get more sprays. Check out the rewards breakdown below.

Notably, this story is about Mercy struggling with the decision of whether or not to answer Winston's call and rejoin the fight. We know from the [Overwatch 2](https://www.gamespot.com/overwatch-2/) trailer that debuted at BlizzCon that the group joining forces again is a major part of the story, so we may see more events laying the groundwork for that in the coming months. We'll also see [redesigned heroes](https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/overwatch-2-redesigns-see-how-its-heroes-have-chan/2900-3150/) and [some new faces](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/at-least-four-new-heroes-could-be-in-the-works-for/1100-6471292/) in Overwatch 2.
