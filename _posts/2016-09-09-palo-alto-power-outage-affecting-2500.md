A power outage on Sunday, Jan. 11, is affecting about 2,500 City of Palo Alto Utilities customers. It started around 1 p.m. and is expected to last a few hour. Map courtesy city of Palo Alto.

Power went out in the Barron Park area of Palo Alto around 1 p.m. Sunday, impacting about 2,500 customers, according to a tweet from City of Palo Alto Utilities.

The cause is "most likely" a mylar ballon that hit utility wires, the Utilities Department stated.

Crews are working to restore electricity, a task that is expected to take a few hours, the department stated.

A map of the outage can be found on the city's [Utilities website](http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/outagemap).

The map shows that about 22% of customers in the section of the city roughly bounded by Middlefield Road, Foothill Expressway, San Antonio Road and Page Mill/Oregon Expressway, plus the College Terrace and Southgate neighborhoods, have been affected.
