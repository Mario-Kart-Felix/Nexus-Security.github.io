American singer-songwriter

**Pam Reynolds Lowery** (1956 – May 22, 2010), from [Atlanta, Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia "Atlanta, Georgia"), was an American singer-songwriter.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Reynolds_case#cite_note-obit-1) In 1991, at the age of 35, she stated that she had a [near-death experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-death_experience "Near-death experience") (NDE) during a brain operation performed by [Robert F. Spetzler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Spetzler "Robert F. Spetzler") at the [Barrow Neurological Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrow_Neurological_Institute "Barrow Neurological Institute") in [Phoenix, Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona "Phoenix, Arizona"). Her experience is one of the most widely documented in [near-death studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-death_studies "Near-death studies") because of the circumstances under which it happened. Reynolds was under close medical monitoring during the entire operation. During part of the operation she had no brain-wave activity and no blood flowing in her brain, which rendered her [clinically dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_death "Clinical death"). She claimed to have made several observations during the procedure which later medical personnel reported to be accurate.

This near-death experience claim has been considered by some to be evidence of the survival of consciousness after death, and of a life after death. However, others have pointed to prosaic and conventional means as possible explanations.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Reynolds_case#cite_note-French_2005-2) Reynolds died from heart failure, on Saturday May 22, 2010, age 53 at [Emory University Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emory_University_Hospital "Emory University Hospital"), in [Atlanta, Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia "Atlanta, Georgia").

Diagnosis and operation
-----------------------

Pam Reynolds reported to her physician that she was experiencing symptoms of [dizziness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizziness "Dizziness"), [loss of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphasia "Aphasia") and [difficulty in moving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis "Paralysis") parts of her body. Her physician referred her to a neurologist and a [CAT scan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAT_scan "CAT scan") later revealed that Reynolds had a large [aneurysm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm "Aneurysm") in her brain, close to the [brain stem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_stem "Brain stem"). Because of the difficult position of the aneurysm, Reynolds was predicted to have no chance of surviving surgery for its removal. As a last resort, [Robert F. Spetzler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Spetzler "Robert F. Spetzler") — a neurosurgeon of the [Barrow Neurological Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrow_Neurological_Institute "Barrow Neurological Institute") in [Phoenix, Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona "Phoenix, Arizona") — decided that a rarely performed procedure, known as [hypothermic cardiac arrest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standstill_operation "Standstill operation"), could improve Reynolds's chances of surviving surgical removal of the aneurysm. During this procedure, also known as a [standstill operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standstill_operation "Standstill operation"), Reynolds's body temperature was lowered to 50 °F (10 °C), her breathing and heartbeat stopped, and the blood drained from her head. Her eyes were closed with tape and small ear plugs with speakers were placed in her ears. These speakers emitted audible clicks which were used to check the function of the brain stem to ensure that she had a flat [EEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography "Electroencephalography") — or a non-responsive brain — before the operation proceeded. The operation was a success and Reynolds recovered completely. The total surgery lasted about seven hours with a few complications along the way.

Claimed NDE
-----------

Reynolds reported that during the operation she heard a sound like a [natural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sign "Natural sign") 'D' that seemed to pull her out of her body and allowed her to "float" above the operating room and watch the doctors perform the operation. Reynolds claims that during this time she felt "more aware than normal" and her vision was more focused and clearer than normal vision. She reported seeing the surgical "saw" but said it looked like an [electric toothbrush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_toothbrush "Electric toothbrush"), and this is in fact true. She said she could hear conversations between operating room staff, even though she had [earphones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headphones#Earphones "Headphones") in her ears which were making a loud clicking noise many times per second in order to monitor her brain function.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Reynolds_case#cite_note-KellyKelly2007-3)

At some point during the operation, she says she noticed a presence and was pulled towards a light. She says she began to discern figures in the light, including her grandmother, an uncle, other deceased relatives and people unknown to her. According to Reynolds, the longer she was there, the more she enjoyed it, but at some point she was reminded that she had to go back. She says her uncle brought her back to her body, but she didn't want to go, so he pushed her in accompanied by a sensation like that of jumping into ice water.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Reynolds_case#cite_note-obit-1)

Reception
---------

Reynolds' [near-death experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-death_experience#Afterlife_claims "Near-death experience") has been put forward as evidence supporting an [afterlife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterlife "Afterlife") by proponents such as cardiologist [Michael Sabom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Sabom "Michael Sabom") in his book _Light and Death_. According to Sabom, Reynold's experience occurred during a period in which her brain had completely ceased to function.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Reynolds_case#cite_note-4)

Critics say that the amount of time which Reynolds was 'flatlined' is generally misrepresented, and suggest that her NDE occurred while under [general anaesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia "General anaesthesia") when the brain was still active, hours before Reynolds underwent hypothermic cardiac arrest.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Reynolds_case#cite_note-Miller2012-5)[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Reynolds_case#cite_note-6)[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Reynolds_case#cite_note-7)

Anesthesiologist Gerald Woerlee analyzed the case, and concluded that Reynolds' ability to perceive events during her surgery was the result of "[anesthesia awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia_awareness "Anesthesia awareness")".[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Reynolds_case#cite_note-Thompson2014-8)

According to the psychologist [Chris French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_French "Chris French"):

> Woerlee, an anesthesiologist with many years of clinical experience, has considered this case in detail and remains unconvinced of the need for a paranormal explanation... \[He\] draws attention to the fact that Reynolds could only give a report of her experience some time after she recovered from the anesthetic as she was still intubated when she regained consciousness. This would provide some opportunity for her to associate and elaborate upon the sensations she had experienced during the operation with her existing knowledge and expectations. The fact that she described the small pneumatic saw used in the operation also does not impress Woerlee. As he points out, the saw sounds like and, to some extent, looks like the pneumatic drills used by dentists.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Reynolds_case#cite_note-French_2005-2)
