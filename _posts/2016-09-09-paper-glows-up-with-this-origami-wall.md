\[Charlyn\] recently found herself dissatisfied with the blank expanse of her bedroom walls. Deciding to take matters into her own hands, [she set out to build this exquisite origami wall sculpture](https://charlyn.codes/origami-wall-art/).

The piece was inspired by a work originally created by \[Coco Sato\], [which she saw on Design Sponge.](https://www.designsponge.com/2015/01/diy-origami-wall-display.html) Materials were sourced, and \[Charlyn\] began the arduous process of cutting and folding the many, many pieces of paper that would make up the final piece. There were some missteps along the way, which served as a lesson to test early and test often, but a cup of tea and perseverance got the job done.

With the paper components completed, she looked to the electronics. Ten Neopixel LEDs were hooked up to a Particle Photon, giving the project easy IoT functionality. Thanks to IFTTT, the display can be controlled via Google Home, either glowing to create a relaxing vibe, or shutting off when it’s time to sleep. There’s also a smattering of flowers decorating the piece, somewhat of a \[Charlyn\] trademark.

The LEDs shine from behind the paper structure, creating a subtle, attractive glow. We’re big fans of the combination of LEDs with origami, and hope to see more projects using the material as an effective diffuser. [You can even experiment with conductive materials to take things further.](https://hackaday.com/2019/08/24/conductive-origami/) Video after the break.
