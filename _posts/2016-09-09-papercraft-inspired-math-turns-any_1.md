> You might not need exotic manufacturing techniques to produce custom-shaped objects. If Harvard scientists have their way, you could start with little more than a sheet and some math. They’ve [created](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2019/08/shape-shifting-sheets) a math framework that borrows from the Japanese [papercraft technique of kirigami](https://www.engadget.com/2015/09/11/kirigami-inspired-solar-cells-can-track-the-sun-without-motors/) (which uses strategic cuts to produce art) to transform any sheet into any shape. Effectively, it involves designing backwards — the intended shape is the last part of the process.

> The team started by establishing the constraints on lengths and angles that need to be met for producing any given cut pattern, and then use a numerical optimization approach to determine the generic patterns themselves (such as their orientation, number and size). From there, it’s a matter of using mechanical analysis to manage the deployment path and its stability. The researchers crafted 2D and 3D models to verify that the method worked.
