Without Parallax, I do not think many/most of us would be here making and selling electronics, from being one of the first companies to bring electronics to educators, to being a pioneer for some many efforts and products in the world of educational electronics. Additionally, many of their products are [made in the USA](https://www.parallax.com/company/made-usa).

First up, who is Parallax? …. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax,_Inc._(company)) –

> Parallax Inc. is a privately held company in Rocklin, California. Parallax Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells BASIC Stamp microcontrollers, Propeller microcontrollers, microcontroller accessories (such as LCDs, sensors, RF modules, etc.), educational robot kits, and educational curriculum. Parallax is headquartered in Rocklin. The Rocklin office employs thirty-five people in research and development, sales, manufacturing, education, marketing, and technical support. Parallax Inc. has over seventy distributors around the world

And also [check out the Parallax about page](https://www.parallax.com/company/about-us) with more details and history of Parallax. They’ve been making electronics since 1986!

![Opensourceprop1Banner](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2019/10/OpenSourceProp1Banner.jpg)

What else? Parallax released the [Propeller 1 Verilog Hardware Description Language source code](https://github.com/parallaxinc/Propeller_1_Design). If you’ve ever wondered how the Propeller chip actually works, this is it.

Parallax was one of the first companies that was doing educational electronics to start to release their files and more, specifically under open-source licenses.

There is an [entire section devoted to Open Source Designs](https://www.parallax.com/support/open-source-designs), which include…

*   Propeller 1 (P8X32A) Multicore Microcontroller Design Files.
*   Parallax Printed Circuit Board Hardware Designs.
*   Propeller Object Code.
*   And Open-Source Software Projects.

One other note, we THINK Parallax was one of the first companies to put the open-source hardware gear-community logo on packaging for retail use, [we have a post about their packaging](https://blog.adafruit.com/2011/08/19/new-packaging-and-products-from-parallax-at-radioshack-stores/comment-page-1/) but will see if we can find the back with the logo.

And here’s some of the [Parallax products/project](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=parallax) we’ve either stocked or did projects with too.

![Ohm](https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2019/09/ohm.jpg)

October is [open-source hardware month](https://ohm.oshwa.org/)! Every single day in October we’ll be posting up some open-source stories from the last decade (and more!) about open-source hardware, open-source software, and beyond!

Have an open-source hardware (or software) success story? A person, company, or project to celebrate? An open-source challenge? Post up here in the comments or email [opensource@adafruit.com](mailto:opensource@adafruit.com), we’ll be looking for, and using the tag [#OHM2019](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OHM2019&src=typed_query&f=live) online as well! Check out [all the events](https://ohm.oshwa.org/events/) going on here!
