> This solder fume extraction system is not intended to replace devices with filters at a professional workplace. But also in the hobby area it is not very beneficial to inhale the solder fumes, which inevitably arise. For this purpose I have developed this simple solder fume extractor.
> 
> My base is a 70 CPU fan, which has been lying idly in an electronics box for years. Since I have developed the device in OpenScad, and of course also make the SCAD file available, any dimensions can be set. For people who are not familiar with OpenScad, I included suitable STL files for 70 and 80 fans.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And donâ€™t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
