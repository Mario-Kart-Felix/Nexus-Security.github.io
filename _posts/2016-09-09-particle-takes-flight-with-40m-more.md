[Particle](https://www.particle.io/) just raised $40m more ..

> In order to continue expanding our footprint and growing the company, we’ve raised a $40 million Series C, led by Qualcomm Ventures and Energy Impact Partners.
> 
> Introducing Particle’s Series C investors
> 
> Qualcomm Ventures was a natural fit for Particle because Qualcomm makes a lot of the technology that is embedded deep within IoT products, which are running on the same wireless networks as our smartphones. At the same time, connecting a machine is different than connecting a smartphone; while the radio might be the same, the tech stack on top of it is extremely different. We’re excited to be working with Qualcomm to bring their world-class technology into a market with very different needs.
> 
> Energy Impact Partners makes investments in the future of energy, and our vision to bring the physical world online will dramatically change how energy is generated, transmitted, and consumed. The products that we connect — from air conditioners to hot tubs to dental compressors to EV chargers — are some of the biggest consumers of energy in their respective environments. By connecting these machines, we can reduce energy waste and provide better information to match energy generation with energy consumption.
> 
> We’re also excited that all our major investors from previous raises are continuing to invest in Particle’s growth: Root Ventures, Bonfire Ventures, Industry Ventures, Spark Capital, OATV, Green D Ventures, Counterpart Ventures, and SOSV all participated in the Series C raise.

The headline “Particle takes flight with $40m more” is because [particle is FEATHER based!](https://blog.adafruit.com/page/2/?s=%40particle) Congrats to Zach and team, and thanks for taking FEATHER to new heights!

[Adafruit mention in VentureBeat article!](https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/30/particle-raises-40-million-for-iot-device-management-and-development-tools/)

> Particle offers LTE and 2G/3G coverage in over 150 countries leveraging a patchwork of carriers, enabling developers to manage devices from a dashboard — Device Cloud — from which they can deploy code or issue updates. This complements the company’s low-power, self-healing Particle Mesh mesh networking solution, which is built on the OpenThread standard and plays nicely with **Adafruit’s Feather form factor**.
