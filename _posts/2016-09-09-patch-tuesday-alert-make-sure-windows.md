For those of you who haven't patched since May, there's exceedingly bad news on the horizon. Per [Catalin Cimpanu at ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/bluekeep-exploit-to-get-a-fix-for-its-bsod-problem/), Metasploit's working-but-just-barely BlueKeep exploit is about to get a significant bug fix. That'll put BlueKeep infection capabilities in the hands of mere mortals. The script kiddies won't be far behind.

If you're using — or you know someone who's using — Windows XP, Vista, Win7, Server 2003, Server 2008 or Server 2008 R2, [get patched now](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3395538/if-youre-running-windows-xp-7-or-associated-servers-patch-them.html). The fix is easy. Even  Aunt Martha can handle it.
