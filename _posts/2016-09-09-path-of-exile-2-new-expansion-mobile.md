The first-ever [Path of Exile](https://www.gamespot.com/path-of-exile/) fan convention, ExileCon, is taking place this weekend in developer Grinding Gear's home city of Auckland, New Zealand. The event kicked off with a bang, as the keynote address with founder Chris Wilson included lots of big announcements and reveals. It was a busy event, to say the least, and in this post we're rounding up all the key announcements.

**Path of Exile 2**
-------------------

A full-on sequel, Path of Exile 2, is in the works for PC and console. Featuring a new, seven-act story and numerous improvements, Path of Exile 2 appears to the be the successor fans have been asking for. Among the new features is the removal of socketing gems, which should simplify and improve things. The game engine has also been improved, and the early demo Grinding Gear showed at ExileCon was very impressive. The initial act of the game is already playable (on the show floor), but fans might want to get comfortable for the full release. Founder Chris Wilson said the studio is taking its time with Path of Exile 2, and won't release it until it meets the studio's rigorous quality standards.

**Path of Exile Mobile**
------------------------

A completely unexpected announcement, Path of Exile Mobile is exactly what it sounds like: a mobile version of the free-to-play action RPG. Grinding Gear announced the game with a silly trailer that pokes fun at the idea of making a mobile game--it's pretty great. The game is only an "experiment" for the studio, and as such, Grinding Gear hasn't committed to actually releasing it at this stage.

**Path of Exile 3.9.0 Expansion**
---------------------------------

Grinding Gear Games announced more details on Path of Exile's upcoming 3.9.0 expansion. Called "Conquerors of the Atlas," the expansion adds a new endgame story, upgradeable maps, and new skills. Specifically, there are new bow skills and support gems on the way. There are also "Support Gem Plus" items coming to Path of Exile, which are even more powerful. Conquerors of the Atlas launches on December 13.

**Path of Exile: Metamorph**
----------------------------

Path of Exile's new league, Metamorph, introduces a new NPC, Tane Octavius, who is described as a "master alchemist." He killed his teacher (bad Tane!), and was exiled for it. "He hopes to find a cure, or perhaps just the source, for what he calls 'the intrinsic darkness' that led to his unforgivable violence," reads a line from the announcement release.
