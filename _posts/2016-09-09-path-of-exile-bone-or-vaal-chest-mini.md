> This is a rendition of the “Bone Chest” in Path of Exile. You can use it to hold your trinkets, or replicate the game and put absolutely nothing inside.\*

> If you print this in PLA you will have no problems getting it to snap together. If you print it in resin, it’s a little tight – you may have to scrape down the inside of the lid so that it fits comfortably on the base.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
