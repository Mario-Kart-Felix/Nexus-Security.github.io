A mobile version of the popular free-to-play RPG [Path of Exile](https://www.gamespot.com/path-of-exile/) was [announced at ExileCon](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-mobile-game-announced-with-funny-rev/1100-6471504/) this weekend in Auckland. From the start, the developers at Grinding Gear Games described the title as ["experimental"](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-mobile-game-announced-with-funny-rev/1100-6471504/) in nature, which led to questions about whether or not it would be released.

Grinding Gear founder Chris Wilson told GameSpot that he _hopes_ to release Path of Exile mobile, but not until the company can answer the important questions about what the game even should be. The studio has created a slice of the game aimed at what hardcore fans want to see, but where it goes from there--if Grinding Gear decides to continue the project--remains to be seen.

"I'd certainly like to release it--but if it's bad, we won't bother," Wilson told GameSpot. "It's looking good, so I'm expecting a release. \[But\] there's questions. Does it have the Path of Exile 2 content? We can do that. I can basically press a button and it's running on it. So it's a matter of what do we want to position it as. Does it have its own storyline. We haven't decided this kind of stuff yet."

Path of Exile Mobile was announced during the ExileCon keynote with a silly, tongue-in-cheek trailer poking fun at some of the popular industry trends around mobile games. Path of Exile Mobile will not have any pay-to-win elements, and it's being developed in-house as opposed to at a different studio.

The announcement trailer is well worth a watch--check it out in the video embed above.

Path of Exile Mobile was just one of the big reveals at ExileCon this weekend. Grinding Gear also announced Path of Exile 2, a new expansion for the base game, and more. For more on all the big reveals, check out GameSpot's news roundup below.
