Pavel Durov claims that the hacking of the iPhone of Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, occurred due to vulnerabilities in WhatsApp. Facebook which owns the messenger insists that the leak is related to the Apple device itself.  
  
The reason for the leak of personal photos and correspondence of the founder of Amazon and the richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos, is a vulnerability in the encryption system of WhatsApp, not problems with Apple gadgets. Telegram founder Pavel Durov wrote about this in his Telegram channel.  
  
This is how he reacted to an interview with Vice President of Facebook's Global Policy Department Nick Clegg, who said that Bezos confidential data leak was due to the iPhone. "We are confident that end-to-end encryption technology cannot be hacked," he said.  
  
Durov recalled that a few months ago he talked about the vulnerabilities of WhatsApp, which, in his opinion, eventually led to the hacking of Bezos smartphone. At the same time, Facebook then assured that there is no evidence that attackers used this vulnerability. According to the founder of Telegram, the backdoor in WhatsApp allowed access to personal messages and photos of the richest man in the world.  
  
Durov explained that the vulnerability used during the hacking of Bezos phone existed not only on iOS, but also on smartphones with Android and Windows. In addition, it is not available in other messengers.  
  
Durov also accused WhatsApp management of using the phrase "end-to-end encryption" as a "magic spell" that automatically makes correspondence secure. He pointed out that the technology itself does not guarantee complete privacy. For example, WhatsApp developers may intentionally leave vulnerabilities in the app at the request of security forces from different countries. As a result, WhatsApp has no problems with the authorities, and Telegram is banned in some countries like Russia and Iran.
