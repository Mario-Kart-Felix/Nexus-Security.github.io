Pearl Jam’s new album and promotional material has an AR twist. Use your phone to interact with the music in a new way!

Via [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/pearl-jam-superblood-wolfmoon-app-augmented-reality-951836/):

> A week before the single’s official release, Pearl Jam have previewed their latest Gigaton song, “Superblood Wolfmoon,” with a catch: In order to access the track, you need to aim your cellphone at the moon.
> 
> Republic Records and creative studio Powster have teamed for an augmented-reality experience unlocked via Pearl Jam’s web app.

> Android and iOS users can visit the [moon.pearljam.com](http://moon.pearljam.com/) site to unlock the AR experience. The band previously employed AR technology in the lead-up to [its Gigaton announcement](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/pearl-jam-new-album-gigaton-tour-936423/).
