### New cloud-compatible debugging workflows

Upload recordings of test failures from various sources — CI, QA staff, developers — into the Pernosco system.

Send Pernosco session URLs to developers for collaborative debugging.

### Omniscient debugging: beyond time travel

Instead of looking at the state at a single point in time, visualize execution behavior across time.

Pernosco precomputes and indexes program states for unbelievably fast interaction.

Pernosco also leverages the state database for fastest-ever gdb and log-style debugging!
