Solar cells based on perovskites have reached enormously high efficiencies within only a few years. Those with hybrid halide perovskite, i.e. materials containing inorganic and organic components, achieve particularly high efficiencies, but lack long-term stability. Even though inorganic perovskite semiconductors, such as CsPbI3, are less efficient, they are considered interesting as well, since they may overcome the stability issues of hybrid perovskites.
