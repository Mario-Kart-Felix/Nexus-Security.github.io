> My pet dog loves playing with toys especially ones he can chase! I built a robotic ball that switches on and rolls away whenever he interacts with it, notifies me via my mobile phone where I can then take over control and finally powers down when the fun is over to save battery.
> 
> The ball uses a d1 mini micro-controller, programmed using Arduino and is put together using some 3D-printed parts and some cheap, readily available components.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
