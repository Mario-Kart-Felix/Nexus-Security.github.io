It was a snowy day and mad-maker Peter Sripol had a kid’s plastic sled and a [Turnigy RotoMax 150cc brushless outrunner motor](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-rotomax-150cc-size-brushless-outrunner-motor.htm) sitting around in his shop. Something had to be done.

The result is a surprisingly fast and furious (and dangerous-looking) air sled (think: swamp boat for the snow). As I sit here in my Virginia home office and watch snow pouring down, this looks like something I’d rather be doing (at least after a safety cage gets added to that prop).

If you haven’t seen [Peter’s YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7yF9tV4xWEMZkel7q8La_w/featured) yet, it’s a must-subscribe. He builds amazing (human-piloted) planes and drones, flying game chairs, flame-throwing robots, amphibious vehicles, and all sorts of other ambitious and insane contraptions.
