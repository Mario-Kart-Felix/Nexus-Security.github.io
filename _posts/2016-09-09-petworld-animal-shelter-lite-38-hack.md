PetWorld Animal Shelter LITE 3.8 Hack MOD Unlocked APK For Android

"PetWorld 3D: My Shelter" is an animal simulation featuring adorable hamsters, guinea pigs, cats players, cute rabbits, a small pony, fascinating reptiles or cuddly dogs. Welcome to the 3D world of Tournesol refuge!  
The animals you have saved have not always had a good life, but by chance they have at least crossed your path. After a preliminary examination to determine their state of health and establish the necessary care, their life at the shelter can begin.  
"PetWorld 3D: My Refuge" is not only a fun application, it is also very pretty. Journey through the impressive 3D universe of the shelter while fetching water or finding adequate food. When you visit the animals, you can also observe them more closely and watch the hamsters wash, the rabbits jumping, the small horse or the cat waiting for you.
