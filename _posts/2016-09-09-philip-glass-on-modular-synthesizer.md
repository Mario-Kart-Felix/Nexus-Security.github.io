> A lot of liberties taken here, but it’s based on the opening from Philip Glass’ seminal Glassworks. I like to think of it as a pencil sketch by a student sitting in front of a masterpiece in the Met.
> 
> One of many departures from the original that I made was rather than the two over three metre of the original (or is it three over two? it keeps on changing!), I used a Doepfer Clock Divider to arbitrarily assign gates to the five voices using only prime number ratios for the rhythmic divisions, in this case 5, 7, 11, and 13, but I cheated with the 4 underneath! The final moments are given over to the Doepfer 154/155 Sequencer system, creating one-shot aleatoric figures.
