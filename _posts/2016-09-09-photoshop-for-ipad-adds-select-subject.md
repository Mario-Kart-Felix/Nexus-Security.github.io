Photoshop for iPad Launched to Bad Reviews
------------------------------------------

In November 2019, [Adobe released Photoshop for iPad](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/download-adobe-photoshop-for-ipad/). Fans of Photoshop were quick to complain, with negative reviews pouring in. Most of the criticism stemmed from missing features from the iPad version that users have got used to using on the desktop version.

At the time, Adobe made it clear that v1 was “just the beginning of our journey to expand Photoshop to devices”. And that it’s “focused on compositing, basic retouching, and masking, common tasks and workflows that \[…\] will be useful for most Photoshop users.”

Photoshop for iPad Updated With Select Subject
----------------------------------------------

Now, Photoshop for iPad has received its first major update. As detailed in a post on [the Adobe Blog](https://theblog.adobe.com/photoshop-reimagined-for-ipad-introducing-select-subject/), the headline feature is the addition of Select Subject. In a nutshell, this allows you to select the subject of a photo with one tap of the screen.

Select Subject uses AI machine learning technology to automatically select the subject in a photo. This only requires one tap, with “no additional selections or fine-tuning enhancements” required. While it isn’t always perfect, it works well in most cases.

Adobe is also rolling out “major performance improvements to the upload and download experience of cloud documents.” These enhancements are already live for “PSDs of 75mb and larger, with “speed improvements for smaller files” next in line.

Lastly, this update to Photoshop for iPad includes “a host of improvements to the user interface to make it more consistent and easier to use, along with some key usability improvements related to layer and layer adjustment controls and text entry.”
