Via [tom’s HARDWARE](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-sstl-space-earth-pictures-video,40328.html):

> Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL) today announced that it sent a Raspberry Pi Zero into space on its DOT-1 satellite, and it’s got the photo and video evidence to prove it.

> SSTL explained how it set up the camera and Raspberry Pi on the DOT-1 satellite:  
> “After image capture using the camera, the data was stored on the Raspberry Pi computer and then downlinked to SSTL’s ground station in Guildford via the Core-DHS. The new Core-DHS is designed to provide the same level of functionality as SSTL’s heritage equivalent avionics stack, but with a significantly reduced mass and volume, and it consolidates the S-Band Transmitter and Receiver, Global Positioning System, Attitude & Orbit Control System, Interface Module and Bridge and On Board Computer into one module.”
