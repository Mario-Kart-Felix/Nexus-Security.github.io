Pinterest has launched a new feature called Try On. This uses augmented reality (AR) technology to let you virtually try on makeup before you buy it. Which should enable you to try different brands and shades before you spend your hard-earned money.

Millions of people use Pinterest for inspiration, and many go onto buy products through the social media site. The problem, as is the case with all online shopping sites, is that there’s no capacity to try things on before you buy them. Until now.

How Pinterest’s Augmented Reality Feature Works
-----------------------------------------------

Pinterest announced Try On in a post on [the Pinterest Newsroom](https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/pinterests-new-ar-tech-lets-you-try-on-makeup-before-you-buy). According to Pinterest, Try On is designed to “help Pinners explore their style and shop on Pinterest.” And it does this by using augmented reality technology to let you try on makeup. Virtually.

Try On lets you try on different makeup, and then either “save for later shopping, or buy through the retailer’s site.” To use Try On, open the Pinterest camera while in Search, and then click “Try on”. A “Try on” button will also appear on selected products.

You can swipe up to shop from specific brands, including Estée Lauder, Sephora, Neutrogena, and L’Oreal. There are different shades available for all skin tones, and Pinterest won’t be using filters to smooth your skin or alter your appearance in any way.

How to Use Pinterest and Virtual Makeover Apps
----------------------------------------------

Try On is available in the US on the Pinterest app for Android and iOS. It initially only lets you try on lipstick, but different types of makeup are coming soon. Try On will also become available in other countries and on different platforms later.
