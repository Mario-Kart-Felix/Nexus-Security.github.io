> I really liked the original, it printed great. I thought it would be fun to design one with M3 screws and heat set M3 inserts to have a platform jack that is a little more durable. I use mine for positioning a gopro for time lapses and it is quite useful for that.

> Print with 2 or more outlines. If your printer is bad at bridging the only parts that require support are the scissor arms.
> 
> Edit: I have included a version of the jack screw that uses a heat set insert instead of a square nut for those that don’t own any square nuts.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
