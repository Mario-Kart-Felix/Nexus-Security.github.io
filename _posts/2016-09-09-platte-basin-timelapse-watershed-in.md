Water is a critical resource for all life on earth, but sometimes it’s easy to take for granted.  The Platte Basin Timelapse project seeks to change that:

> The Platte Basin Timelapse project tells stories of the Platte River Basin using innovative multimedia content. The long-term documentary project uses more than 60 time-lapse camera systems placed throughout the 90,000 square-mile basin, from its headwaters in the Colorado Rockies to the river’s confluence with the Missouri River on Nebraska’s eastern border.

The site is chock-full of striking images and videos.  One that caught my eye is called “[A Trout With Feathers](http://plattebasintimelapse.com/2019/01/film-a-trout-with-feathers/)“:

> In the upper reaches of North America’s watersheds, one will find a charismatic chunky gray bird dipping and diving underwater in clear, fast-flowing streams. This bird is called the American dipper and is North America’s only aquatic songbird. Photographer and conservationist Mike Forsberg fell in love with the American dipper on a college fishing trip. After learning about these birds and their unique behaviors of dipping and diving underwater, he set out on a mission to document their natural history. This included photographing their behavior above water and below. This film follows Mike on his quest to photograph the American dipper diving underwater in the Poudre River in Colorado and will introduce you to lifelong birder, retired school teacher, and ex-Harley rider Steve Den who helps Mike along the way.
