> Emulation of various Arcade systems (1978-1985) from Space Invaders to Moon Patrol.  
> The emulator is splitted in few projects running specific systems due to memory usage.  
> (see complete list of roms emulated in games.txt)  
> It is based on the early MAME0.36 source code  
> Please compile for smallest code on the Teensy4.0 else you will run out of memory

The hardware:

*   Teensy4.0
*   ILI9341 or ST7789 SPI display
*   SD card (Teensy uses built-in uSD)
*   Analog joypad (Arduino or PSP like)
*   3 buttons (FIRE, USER1 and USER2)

The software is [hosted on GitHub here](https://github.com/Jean-MarcHarvengt/teensyMAME).
