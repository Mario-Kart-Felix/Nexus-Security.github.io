RaspberryPi.org is having a multi-day celebration of Pong. Ebon Upton revealed his Python-based take on the classic game, a version he calls Boin! Now they’ve got a fun project that allows you to play Boing! with ultrasonic sensors to make the game even more fun! From [RaspberryPi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/play-pong-with-ultrasonic-sensors-and-a-raspberry-pi-hackspace-magazine/):

> Games controllers are basically just sensors that take input from the real world in some way and translate that into in-game actions. Most commonly, these sensors are buttons that you press, but there’s no need for that to be the case. You can use almost any sensor you can get input from – it sounds trite, but the main limitation really is your imagination!
> 
> We were playing with ultrasonic distance sensors in the last issue of HackSpace magazine, and this sprung to mind a Pong controller. After all, distance sensors measure in one dimension and Pong bats travel in one dimension.
