Giles Booth on [blogmywiki posts](http://www.suppertime.co.uk/blogmywiki/2019/11/arduboy-microbit/) about playing Arduboy games on a micro:bit.

> There are lots of little machines and platforms for making and playing your own games now; various colour LCD [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/hardware) machines, the Arduino-based [Arduboy](https://arduboy.com/) which uses a tiny but crisp black and white OLED display as well as the more advanced Pimoroni 32blit Kickstarter. There are probably more I’m not aware of.
> 
> A colleague recently showed me the [Micro:Gamer](https://www.tindie.com/products/Fabien-C/microgamer/). This really neat board turns a micro:bit into an Arduboy. It contains a battery pack, buzzer, power switch, 6 buttons and an [OLED display of exactly the type I’ve been experimenting with on micro:bits](http://www.suppertime.co.uk/blogmywiki/2019/11/python-game-microbit-oled/).
> 
> [Using the Arduino IDE with extra libraries installed](https://learn.adafruit.com/use-micro-bit-with-arduino/overview), you flash modified Arduboy games onto a micro:bit which then acts a bit like a game cartridge – plug them into the top of the Micro:Gamer, and get playing.
