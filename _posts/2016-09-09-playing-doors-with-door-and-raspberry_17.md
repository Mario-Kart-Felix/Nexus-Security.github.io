> Trusting in the melodic possibilities of incorporating a [Raspberry Pi 3B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/) and various sensory components into a humble door, Floyd created The Doors Door, a musical door that plays… well, I’m sure you can guess.
> 
> If you want to build your own, you can practice some sophisticated ‘copy and paste’ programming after [downloading the code](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21ALPY%2DEP76EqDAeo&id=5CC3FF9DB18D3AED%21797631&cid=5CC3FF9DB18D3AED). And for links to all the kit you need, check out [the description of the video over on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iBS3sli2-I). While you’re there, be sure to give the video a like, and subscribe to Floyd’s channel.
