What are you doing for Halloween this year? Just gonna set the candy bowl out on the porch and call it good? That’s a risky one, ’cause if one group of mischievous preteens cleans you out, you might get TP’d by the next one. Best to keep Halloween a tad on the scary side and keep those ghouls in line. Candy is a privilege, not a right.

[![](https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/zombie-skeleton.png?w=400)](https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/zombie-skeleton.png)Halloween is a big deal in \[trimbandit\]’s little burg, and he builds a new attraction for the front yard every year. This year, it’s the dawn of the dead — [a fresh zombie rising jerkily from the grave to say hello, world](https://www.instructables.com/id/Intro-and-Supplies/). He moves left, he moves right, he writhes and wrestles, wedged between worlds.

His life force comes from a pneumatic system designed for props. The cylinders connect to a controller with built-in relays that makes programming frightfully easy. Then it was just a matter of adding a foam head, skinning it with a scary mask, and fitting him for a suit from Goodwill. Drag yourself and your candy bucket past the break for a fun-size demo video and a couple of bonus goodies.

We bet \[trimbandit\] is already wondering how to step up his game for next year. He seems to have conquered the ground, so why not [take to the skies for fright and delight](https://hackaday.com/2018/10/09/flying-human-head-lands-just-in-time-for-halloween/)?
