![](https://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/POCO-X2-India-launch-date-1024x512.jpg) After teasers POCO India just confirmed that it will launch the POCO X2 smartphone in India on February 4th. The teaser image confirms 'extreme refresh rate', which will likely be 120Hz, Sony IMX686 64-megapixel 1/1.7″ sensor along with a secondary camera, Snapdragon SoC with support for liquid cooling. The liquid cooling image also confirms pop-up front camera and a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, below the camera module, so it should be an LCD screen. It also confirms support for fast charging, USB Type-C port, bottom-ported loudspeaker and a 3.5mm audio jack. Since the phone doesn't show antenna cutouts so it will likely feature plastic body, similar to the POCO F1. We should know more details about the POCO X2 smartphone in the coming days.
