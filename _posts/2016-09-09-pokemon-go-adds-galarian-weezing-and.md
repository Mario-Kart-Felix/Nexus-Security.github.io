[Pokemon Sword and Shield](https://www.gamespot.com/pokemon-shield/) have officially launched on Nintendo Switch, and [Pokemon Go](https://www.gamespot.com/pokemon-go/) is celebrating the occasion with some new Sword and Shield-inspired content. Not only can you now get trainer outfits based on the main characters in the Switch Pokemon games, you'll also have your first chance to catch a Galarian Pokemon.

Following [November's Community Day](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-november-community-day-is-today-start-t/1100-6471490/), Galarian Weezing will appear in four-star Raid Battles. Unlike a typical Weezing, this Galarian variant is a dual Poison/Fairy-type, and it has smokestacks on its heads that resemble top hats. Galarian Weezing will appear in Raids from 2-3 PM local time, immediately following today's Community Day. After that hour, the Pokemon will periodically appear in Raids, so you'll still have a chance to catch it.

As previously mentioned, Niantic has also added new avatar outfits for your trainer to Pokemon Go's Style Shop. These are based on the default outfits worn by the male and female protagonists in Sword and Shield. You can read more details about the outfits and Galarian Weezing Raids on the official [Pokemon Go website](https://pokemongolive.com/post/swordshield-galarianweezing).

November's Community Day runs from 11 AM - 2 PM local time today, November 16. This month's featured Pokemon is Chimchar, the Fire-type starter from Pokemon Diamond and Pearl. Throughout the event, the fire chimp will appear in the wild much more often than normal, and if you can evolve it all the way into Infernape up to two hours after the Community Day ends, it'll learn the powerful Fire-type attack Blast Burn.

Niantic has [plenty of other Pokemon Go events](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-november-events-include-new-shiny-and-l/1100-6471441/) lined up this month. Starting November 19, the developer is kicking off a Supereffective Week, during which you'll have your first chance to catch a Shiny Tentacool. Then, on November 26, the Legendary Pokemon Terrakion will make its debut in five-star Raids. Finally, Niantic is holding Pokemon Go's first-ever Friend Fest starting November 27. You can catch up on all the latest Pokemon Go news below.
