[Pokemon Go](https://www.gamespot.com/pokemon-go/) has [quite a few events](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-november-events-include-new-shiny-and-l/1100-6471441/) lined up for the rest of November, including the arrival of a new Legendary Pokemon. Before then, however, Niantic is hosting the game's latest Community Day. This month's event takes place this Saturday, November 16, and as usual, it'll offer players around the world a chance to catch a rare Pokemon and snag a special event-exclusive move.

Typically, every Pokemon Go Community Day only runs for three hours, but the particulars of each event--from what time it starts to what Pokemon you'll be more likely to find in the wild and other bonuses that will be available--vary month by month. To help get you up to speed on this month's event, we've rounded up all the most important details about Pokemon Go's [November Community Day](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-november-2019-community-day-date-shiny-/1100-6470604/) below.

What Is November's Featured Pokemon?
------------------------------------

Ahead of each Community Day, Niantic designates one "featured" Pokemon that will appear much more often than normal during the event. This month's featured Pokemon is **Chimchar**, the Fire-type starter from [Pokemon Diamond and Pearl](https://www.gamespot.com/pokemon-diamond-version/). Throughout the Community Day, Chimchar will spawn in the wild more often than it normally does. You'll also have your first chance of encountering a **Shiny Chimchar** during the event. These will be rare, however, so you'll need to be persistent if you're hoping to add a Shiny to your collection.

What Is November's Special Community Day Move?
----------------------------------------------

Not only does the featured Pokemon appear more often in the wild during a Community Day, it is also able to learn a special event-exclusive move that it couldn't otherwise learn in Pokemon Go, but only if you can evolve it into its final form by the end of the event. That holds true for November's Community Day. If you can evolve Chimchar all the way into Infernape up to two hours after the event ends, the Pokemon will automatically learn the powerful Fire-type attack **Blast Burn**. This applies to any Chimchar you have in your collection, even if you caught it prior to the event, but it will only learn Blast Burn if it evolves during the designated time frame.

What Time Does November's Community Day Start?
----------------------------------------------

As previously mentioned, each Community Day only runs for three hours, although the event often starts at different times depending on the month. Like last month's event, November's Community Day will take place early in the day, from **11 AM to 2 PM local time**. That means you'll have until 4 PM local time to evolve an Infernape and learn Blast Burn.

What Other Bonuses Are Available?
---------------------------------

On top of increased Pokemon spawns, Niantic offers a couple of other bonuses during each Community Day as an extra incentive to participate in the event. As usual, any Lure Modules you use during November's Community Day will last for three hours, rather than their usual 30 minutes. Additionally, **Pokemon eggs will hatch at a quarter of the distance** they typically require during the event, allowing you to hatch eggs more quickly than normal.
