[Pokemon Sword and Shield](https://www.gamespot.com/pokemon-shield/) are out today, marking the next generation of pocket monsters to catch and battle. Like most of the main series Pokemon games, it has a little Easter egg to Nintendo's current system, but this one is even more special than you might realize.

The player character has a Nintendo Switch in his or her bedroom. This in itself is pretty standard--Pokemon player characters have had shout-outs to Game Boy, DS, and more in their rooms throughout its long history. This particular Switch, though, showcases the customizable nature of swapping your Joy-Con controllers. As noted by several people on Twitter, the colors of the tiny Switch change to match the first-party Joy-Con you have on your own actual Switch.

> So a neat detail I noticed, the joy cons are different meaning it reads what colour joy cons you have in the console, so that to me is awesome [#PokemonSwordandShield](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonSwordandShield?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc^tfw) [pic.twitter.com/cOLklsM249](https://t.co/cOLklsM249)

It's easy to miss since the system is so tiny on screen, and if you happen to be using third-party Joy-Con they'll appear as a default gray instead. Still, it's a nice touch that helps reflect that the player character represents you, personalized Switch and all.

The reception to Pokemon Sword and Shield has been [mostly positive from critics](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-sword-and-shield-review-roundup-what-do-th/1100-6471400/), including in GameSpot's [review](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-sword-and-shield-review-you-can-count-on-m/1900-6417363/).

"In collecting, battling, and exploring, Sword and Shield cut out the bloat and focus on what makes these pillars of the Pokemon games so captivating in the first place," Kallie Plagge wrote. "You're not held back by overly complicated back-end systems or hoops to jump through; from the outset, you can start wandering the Galar region, seeing its new Pokemon, and trying out its new battle strategies with very little in your way. This leaves you free to enjoy what Pokemon is all about, and that makes for an incredibly strong showing for the series' proper debut on Switch."
