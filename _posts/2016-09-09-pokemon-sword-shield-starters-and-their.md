### 

[Pokemon Sword and Shield](https://www.gamespot.com/pokemon-shield/) are now available on Nintendo Switch, and one of the first decisions you make is picking which starter Pokemon you'd like to accompany you on your journey. All three options in Sword and Shield are adorable, at least at first. But they will eventually evolve and change, and that might impact your decision from the outset.

Here's each of the starters and their second- and third-stage evolutions so you aren't too surprised later in the game. Regardless of who you pick, though, you can always swap them out for another Pokemon if you aren't a fan, or trade with friends to complete your collection--so don't be too worried about it!

In our [Pokemon Sword and Shield review](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-sword-and-shield-review-you-can-count-on-m/1900-6417363/), we praised many aspects of the games, but acknowledged that the starters' evolutions are universally not that great. There are plenty of other great Pokemon, though, so be sure to check out our guide to finding [some of the coolest Pokemon in the game](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-sword-and-shield-where-to-catch-cool-and-r/1100-6471487/) if you're on the hunt for a different one.

We also have plenty of other guides, including how to evolve a few different Pokemon with unconventional evolution methods: [Milcery to Alcremie](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-sword-and-shield-guide-how-to-evolve-milce/1100-6471475/), [Galarian Linoone to Obstagoon](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-sword-and-shield-guide-how-to-evolve-galar/1100-6471476/), [Sinistea to Polteageist](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-sword-and-shield-guide-how-to-evolve-sinis/1100-6471477/), and [Applin](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-sword-and-shield-guide-how-to-evolve-appli/1100-6471478/) into a different Pokemon based on your version.
