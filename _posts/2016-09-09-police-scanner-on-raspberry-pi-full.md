Rad [project + tutorial](https://youtu.be/iE9U6xmIpbM) from Kevin Darrah. Via [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/use-a-raspberry-pi-to-make-a-police-scanner-radio-73b475ba806d)

> Found this website where people can livestream from their scanners: [https://www.broadcastify.com](https://www.broadcastify.com)
> 
> Gave me the idea to make a dedicated device out of a raspberry Pi to cycle through a few of my favorite streams – mostly police channels, but can also stream music. Lots of good stuff in this one that you can use in many projects. Sorry if you thought this was going to be an SDR project… for some reason I gotta feeling those comments are coming.
