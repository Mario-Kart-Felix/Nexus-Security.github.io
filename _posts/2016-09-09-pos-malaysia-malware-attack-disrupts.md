IT infrastructure of Pos Malaysia, postal delivery service in Malaysia, took a major hit from ransomware which rendered some of its online services inaccessible. After detecting the attack on Sunday, the company took immediate measures to shut down internal systems and parts of its online systems; they also lodged a police report with Royal Malaysia Police for attempted malware attack and reached out to concerned authorities to ensure the safety of their systems and database.  
  
The website of the company was displaying an error message during the downtime, which said, “Sorry, we are under maintenance.” It was discovered during a system update on October 20 and since then, the company released three statements insisting on the safety of customers’ personal data and sensitive information. It assured that no user data was compromised and the issues are being rectified. Gradually, several of Pos Malaysia’s online services have been made accessible while over the counter services remain available at the company’s branches nationwide. However, the officials refrained from providing a specific timeline for the entire restoration of the halted services.  
  
Seemingly, it was a major attempt that caused disruption in the company’s internal systems and online services for the past few days and subsequently affected the overall company’s operations.  
  
In a statement on Facebook, Pos Malaysia told, “Our team has managed to rectify and restore several of the system and online services. We assure our customers that their data and personal information are safe.”  
  
“We extend our apologies for the inconvenience caused and thank our customers for their kind understanding, patience and support during this period. We will provide regular updates from time to time,” it added.  
  
Announcing that the services will be restored and made fully accessible gradually, a spokesperson told The Star, "Customers and business partners may now gradually access our services. Over the counter services at all branches remain available.”  
  
"Currently, proactive steps are being taken by our IT recovery team to ensure minimal impact to our customers and business partners. While contingency plans are being considered to rectify and restore online operations, the majority of our services at all Pos Malaysia branches are still available," he added.  
  
People who have made shipments via Pos Malaysia or have pending shipments and it required them to share any sensitive data with the postal delivery company, odds are it would have been compromised in the attempted malware attack, therefore, they are advised to check their private credentials where necessary.
