> Previously I 3D printed an enormous T Rex skull and custom life sized helmet by Markom3D. I was still coming to terms with the CR-10 Max so the quality was a bit average. In this video, I use a variety of techniques to transform these items into something I am proud of. The helmet now has a hammer tone metal appearance, the the T Rex skull has been weathered to appear like old, excavated bone.

> This was really challenging for me, I’m super impatient with sanding and generally avoid these projects. With that in mind I’m thrilled with how they turned out.
