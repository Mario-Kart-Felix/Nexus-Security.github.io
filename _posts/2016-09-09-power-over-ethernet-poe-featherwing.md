[Patrick Van Oosterwijck](https://twitter.com/xorbit1) and Silicognition are preparing to crowdfund the power over Ethernet FeatherWing [seen in the recent Adafruit Take Flight with Feather contest on hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/168356-poe-featherwing).

Per hackster.io, the â€˜Wing will provide support for a 4W draw over Power over Ethernet (PoE) â€” allowing [Feather-based devices](https://www.adafruit.com/category/943) to receive power and network connectivity over a single cable.

> The PoE FeatherWing supports IEEE 802.3at Class 1, Mode A and Mode B Power over Ethernet (PoE) with up to 4W available to connected devices. The Ethernet connectivity itself is provided by a WIZnet W5500 Ethernet controller, allowing for full compatibility with any libraries and software designed for the non-PoE Adafruit Ethernet FeatherWing, while a Microchip 24AA02E48 means each unit has a guaranteed globally-unique MAC. The design even incorporates a solder point to enableÂ [Giant Board](https://www.hackster.io/news/the-giant-board-linux-on-a-feather-f870c0e36678)Â support, without the need for the usual IRQ fly-wire connection.

The PoE FeatherWing is due to landÂ [on Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/silicognition)Â soon; pricing has yet to be confirmed.

For more on the Feather line of boards see the [Awesome Feather list](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-feather/blob/master/README.md) and [Feather compatible gear at Adafruit.com](https://www.adafruit.com/category/943).
