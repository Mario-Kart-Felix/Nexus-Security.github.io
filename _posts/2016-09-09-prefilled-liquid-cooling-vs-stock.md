Priyank, Priyank Gada, #Priyank #Heatsink #Computer Hello guys My name is 'Priyank Gada' and in this video, ill try to solve all your doubts related to Stock Heatsink cooler, Aftermarket Heatsink Coolers and liquid cooling i.e. prefilled liquid cooling and custom liquid cooling. So without wasting time, let's start with the video. Super excited to start this video because personally being a gamer, i love cooling options and learning about new RGB custom liquid coolers Gamers focus a lot on various cooling options so without wasting time let's start with the video. Hey guys my name is Priyank Gada and you are watching my youtube channel 'Priyank Gada' wherein I try to solve all your questions and doubts. Every gaming system or a computer setup has 3 cooling options Cooling is very important Computers may auto reboot due to heat and cause major problems in long run. so all your graphics card, may it be GTX, RTX 20xx series, every graphic card needs proper cooling even CPU face major issues after long hours of heated use Every CPU comes with a stock cooler also known as heatsink So basically besides using air, there are two other methods to cool the CPU Heatsink touches the CPU and transforms heat and Copper is best material for transfering heat We all know that copper is a good conductor of heat. Heat travels faster in copper. Heatsinks also use surface area larger surface area in contact with air means easier to cool. Heatsinks have fins to increase surface area Aftermarket heatsinks have more fins thus increase the surface area. Heatsink will suck the heat and spread it in air more surface area means faster cooling thus cooling the CPU Stock coolers are coolers or heatsink that come with modern CPU Usually stock coolers are free and come bydefault with your CPU. Stock coolers are usually silent while operating with high RPM fans unless you play around with the fans on the stock coolers. Stock Cooler or stock heatsink are ok or good for normal operations but increasing systems processing power and load, will result in more heat thus requires a better cooling option So there is a need for better cooling option for heavy processing like editor and rendering Aftermarket cooling options are better version of Air Cooling or stock heatsinks Aftermarket coolers use air to suck the heat just like Stock heatsinks or stock coolers Most aftermarket coolers have more than one fan they also have more fins and are bigger in surface area and use copper material Increasing the perfomance of cooling Lets talk about the cons of after market air cooling heatsinks Most aftermarket coolers don't have silent operation option and make sound since they have much faster and heavier fans Aftermarket air coolers are larger in size and thus might cause size related issue with smaller case You might face problems while installing components like RAM and graphics card on smaller motherboard It might occupy some slots on your motherboard and even voltage issues if you have a smaller Powersupply unit. since most aftermarket air coolers need separate wire for fan. but its better than stock air coolers which are shipped with your CPU and you might have to consider a larger motherboard and larger case for aftermarket coolers and the next cooling option is liquid cooling for people who deal with rendering and edit movies and even high-end gamers use liquid cooling. I have a different video on liquid cooling which is a detailed video there are two types of liquid cooling options for CPU and GPUs Pre-filled liquid coolers have a coolant i.e. liquid that cools the heatsink inside the cooler The cooler comes with a pre-filled liquid that cools the CPU and sucks the heat Prefilled liquid coolers start from 100$ and 120$ depending on the size of the radiator. I have a detailed video on liquid cooling - please check the description prefilled liquid coolers have a coolant and a radiator Pricing usually depends on the size and the power of the radiator. Radiator have fixed standard size of 120mm and 240mm for standard normal operations
