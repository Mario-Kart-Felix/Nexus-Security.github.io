> Our earlier project Convert a Bunch of LED Strips into a Big Video Display explains how to build big and affordable hand-made video LED displays that connect to the Raspberry Pi, or any other computer with the standard video output, as an ordinary monitor and with absolutely no programming required to display any video content. The key component in that project is the open-source Pixblasters-Light FPGA based LED controller.
> 
> This LED controller enables easy control of up to 8, 192 RGB LEDs, RGB888 pixel format for 16M colors, integrated gamma correction and support for LED displays with resolutions up to 512 x 16 (H x V). Such LED driving capabilities already enables giant LED displays, i.e. 8.5 x 0.3 meters when built by 60 LEDs/m strip and monumental 17 x 0.3 meters when built by 30 LEDs/m.
