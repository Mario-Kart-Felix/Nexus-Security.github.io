[Programming the Adafruit Feather STM32F405 Express with STM32CubeIDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOjzs4y5hWA) –

> Adafruit released a new Feather Express board based on the STM32F405 microcontroller. Adafruit will focus on CircuitPython with the new board, but with all the time we spent using STM32CubeIDE, we just had to try programming it with C!
> 
> In this tutorial, we’ll create a quick blinking LED example and upload it to the board using the built-in DFU bootloader. That will require using the dfu-util tool, and if you’re on Windows, you’ll need to install the WinUSB driver via Zadig.
> 
> From there, we’ll create a simple temperature logger. The Feather STM32F405 Express has a built-in SD card and STEMMA-QT connector, so we’ll take a reading from a PCT2075 sensor over I2C, print it out over the virtual serial port (USB), and log it to a file on the SD card.
> 
> Finally, we’ll use the test points on the back of the board to break out the SWD debug port. That will allow us to perform step-through debugging operations on the board.
