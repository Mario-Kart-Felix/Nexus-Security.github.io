[Fabien Chouteau](https://github.com/Fabien-Chouteau/shoot-n-loot) appeared on Adafruit [Show and Tell](https://learn.adafruit.com/show-and-tell) recently and demonstrated a Shoot-n-Loot, a sophisticated graphics game written all in Ada! Yes, Ada! Fabien did have to write device drivers for the hardware on an [Adafruit PyGamer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4242), but the results are stunning.
