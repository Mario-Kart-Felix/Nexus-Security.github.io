This comic was created for the Toggl team – the people behind the world’s no. 1 time tracking app. We’re pretty passionate about time tracking, no matter what device you may be using.

If you’re a frequent traveler, you may want to check out our guide to using lifehacking (aka common sense) to make your [airport experience 250% more pleasant](http://blog.toggl.com/airport-hacks-infographic/). We’ve also used dinosaurs to explain the [different issues freelancers deal with when working with clients](https://blog.toggl.com/freelancing-problems-dinosaurs/).

We’ve also done an epic piece about how the [world might be a little different if it were created by a programmer](http://blog.toggl.com/world-created-programmer/ "If The World Was Created By A Programmer [Comic]"). If that sort of thing is your jam, you may also enjoy [The Unicorn Startup Simulator](https://toggl.com/startup-simulator/) – a highly realistic, deeply immoral game about life in the gritty startup scene of Silicon Valley.

We also love animals too, [especially the ones that take their time when it comes to – well, basically everything](https://blog.toggl.com/time-management-slow-animals/). Time management is a serious thing, but maybe Johnnie the Sloth isn’t the best mammal to look up to when it comes to organizing your life (but boy, would you get some pretty great naps if you took his advice).

We’ll also keep doing these comics, so like us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/toggl) and follow us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/usetoggl/?hl=en) if you want these delivered directly to your eyeballs! We also post on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/toggl) if you’re going to pretend you’re doing work.

If you have any ideas for the next one, let us know where it says “Comments” or reach out to us on social media!
