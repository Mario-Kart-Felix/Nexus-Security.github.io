During [the Inside Xbox X019 livestream](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/x019-inside-xbox-livestream-news-everwild-grounded/1100-6471272/), the company announced a wide variety of games for Xbox One, including the acclaimed theme park game [Planet Coaster](https://www.gamespot.com/planet-coaster/). We've since learned that this version of the game, Planet Coaster: Console Edition, is also coming to PS4.

Planet Coaster is a roller coaster management simulation and builder, where you construct your own amusement parks to satisfy the many denizens of the game's world. Microsoft announced that the game is headed to Xbox One in Summer 2020.

The news at X019 was followed up soon after with word of Tell Me Why, [the newest game from Dontnod Entertainment](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/life-is-strange-dev-reveals-new-game-tell-me-why/1100-6471450/), the studio behind the [Life is Strange](https://www.gamespot.com/life-is-strange/) series. The game is another narrative-focused experience that follows twins in a small Alaskan town. Similar to Planet Coaster, Tell Me Why is aiming for a Summer 2020 release on Xbox One.

Another new announcement was The Artful Escape, a colorful platformer from prolific indie game publisher Annapurna Interactive. The game is expected to launch on Apple Arcade, PC, and Xbox One sometime in 2020.

Microsoft confirmed that every game revealed launches day and date on Xbox Game Pass. The X019 livestream has wrapped up, and the company has divulged a bevy of information, including some release dates, new game announcements, closed and open beta opportunities, and more.
