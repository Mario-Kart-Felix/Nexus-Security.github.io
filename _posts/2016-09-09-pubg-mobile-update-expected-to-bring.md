Despite the advent of new battle-royale games like Call of Duty: Mobile, the popularity of [PUBG Mobile](https://beebom.com/pubg-mobile-payload-war-mode-introduced/) has not fallen adversely and there exists a separate fanbase for the game. PUBG Mobile is all set to receive a new update with version 0.17.0 this month. A new report suggests that this **upcoming update could bring the long-awaited Erangel 2.0 map**.  

The news comes from _Mr.Ghost _who cites an official PUBG Mobile Telegram channel as the source. In the channel, a post was made that roughly translates to: _“Soon PUBG Mobile will be 2 years old. New Game Icon in update 0.17.0. Waiting for Erangel 2.0?”_  

In case you’re unaware, Erangel 2.0 map is expected to introduce a whole bunch of new features **including the ability to throw items to your fellow teammates** and expanded item carry capacity. Also, the map could include a secret base similar to the PUBG PC version.  

In addition, the update is rumored to bring classes similar to what we have in Call of Duty: Mobile. However, this could be added as a separate mode under EvoGround. We could expect the addition of Extreme Cold Mode where your survival skills would come in handy and a Colorblind Mode along with a 12-gauge shotgun DBS as well.  

With all that said, if you’re interested to get early hands-on experience with features and additions that will be rolled out to everyone else on a later date, you may apply [here](https://beebom.com/apply-pubg-mobile-beta-test-features/). At the moment, the game is not accepting new testers but the beta testing window could open sometime later.
