> What happens when you give two linguists jobs at Raspberry Pi? They start thinking they can do digital making, even though they have zero coding skills! Because if you don’t feel inspired to step out of your comfort zone here — surrounded by all the creativity, making, and technology — then there is no hope you’ll be motivated to do it anywhere else.

> Maja and I support the community of [Raspberry Pi translation volunteers](https://www.raspberrypi.org/translate/), and we wanted to build something to celebrate them and the amazing work they do! Our educational content is already available in 26 languages, with more than 400 translations on our [projects website](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/). But our volunteer community is always translating more content, and so off we went, on an ambitious (by our standards!) mission to create a **Raspberry Pi–powered translation notification system**. This is a Raspberry Pi that pulls GitHub data to display a message on a Sense HAT and play a tune whenever we add fresh translated content to the [Raspberry Pi projects website](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/)!
