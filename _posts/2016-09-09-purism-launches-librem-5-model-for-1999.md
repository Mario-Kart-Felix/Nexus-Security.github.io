Purism has launched a special version of its [Librem 5](https://shop.puri.sm/shop/librem-5/) focused on the US market. For those unaware, Librem 5 is a smartphone that focuses on the user’s security and privacy. The company’s new smartphone will be manufactured entirely in the US inside its US facility where it makes Librem 5 devkits and Librem Key. This move by Purism is to address the concerns of customers regarding attacks in the supply chain.  

_“Having a secure auditable US based supply chain including parts procurement, fabrication, testing, assembly, and fulfillment all from within the same facility is the best possible security story.”,_ says Todd Weaver, Founder & CEO of Purism.  

In terms of specifications, Purism Librem 5 USA comes with a 5.7-inch display with 720×1440 pixel resolution. It is powered by NXP i.MX8M quad-core chipset clocked at 1.5GHz. The device equips 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage, expandable with the help of a microSD card.

Regarding software, Purism 5 USA runs on open-source [Pure OS](https://pureos.net/), the company’s own [alternative to Android](https://beebom.com/android-alternative/) and iOS. The handset draws juice from a 3,500 mAh battery which is replaceable by the user.
