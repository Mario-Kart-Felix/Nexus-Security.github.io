[_Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse_](https://www.geek.com/movies/moviebobs-10-reasons-into-the-spider-verse-is-the-best-spider-man-movie-ever-1774946/) was pretty fantastic. As an animated film, it had a dazzling visual style that live-action comic book movies could only dream up. Its dimension-hopping storyline and diverse cast of characters only enhanced, never overwhelmed, the touching retelling of Miles Morales’s origin tale. And it’s arguably the best feature film of arguably the best Marvel Comics character. It won an Oscar!

  

So while we weren’t surprised we were definitely stoked to learn that Sony is preparing a _Spider-Verse_ sequel as part of its shaky slate of Spider-Man movies while the Disney deal starts to wind down. Because this movie’s careful web is spun with such care, [_Spider-Verse 2_](https://www.geek.com/movies/ant-man-3-and-spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-2-expand-marvels-smallest-heroes-2-1809212/) isn’t coming until April 8, 2022, hopefully with 60s Spider-Man and Oscar Isaac’s Spider-Man 2099. In the meantime, we thought we’d dream about eight other alternate reality Spider-Men we’d love to see swing into the sequel. And no this does not include whatever [J.J. Abrams and his son](https://www.geek.com/comics/pray-to-sam-raimi-the-spider-man-4-comic-is-real-1792306/) hacked together.

Tobey Maguire as the 2002 Spider-Man

  

### Tobey Maguire

  

Apparently the original plan for the first _Spider-Verse_ was to include some kind of cameo from a live-action Spider-Man like Andrew Garfield or Tom Holland. But the one true choice is the one true cinematic Peter Parker, Tobey Maguire. Peter B. Parker’s storyline is already _Spider-Man 4_ is you squint. There’s never been a better time to go full Raimi. As far as live-action Parkers go, we’d also accept Nicholas Hammond or those kids who nearly killed themselves for the Spider-Man musical.

### Ben Reilly

  

Before breaking dimensional barriers, the infamous _Clone Saga_ in the comic books already gave us way too many Spider-Men to keep track of. The poster boy for the whole debacle is Ben Reilly the Scarlet Spider. 90s sleeveless hoodie, baby.

### Spider-Woman

  

Despite the Spider-Woman name, Jessica Drew is really her own character that doesn’t have much to do with Peter Parker or Miles Morales. We’d expect to see her in an MCU _Secret Invasion_ movie before a Spider-Man movie. However, rumor has it Sony wants to do a _Spider-Women_ movie with Drew and Spider-Gwen, so maybe they’ll set that up in _Spider-Verse 2_. Or they could save the name for Peter and Mary Jane’s alternate universe superpowered daughter May the Spider-Girl.

### Spider-Man: Reign

  

_Spider-Man: Reign_ is an accidentally hilarious and gritty _Dark Knight Returns-_style dystopian future Spider-Man comic where Peter is a sad old man who inadvertently gave Mary Jane deadly cancer with his radioactive lovemaking. Really. And you thought Peter B. Parker was tragic.

### Static Shock

  

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, the wisecracking teenage superheroics of Virgil “Static” Hawkins made him the [Black Spider-Man](https://www.geek.com/comics/static-shock-is-the-best-black-spider-man-1688480/) years before Marvel got around to it with Miles. And Static’s original identity makes him a bit better in my opinion. So make the deal with DC and give us the Black Spider-Man team-up we deserve.

### Indian Spider-Man

  

The first _Spider-Verse_ went anime with Peni Parker, and _Spider-Verse 2_ could go Bollywood with Pavitr Prabhakar the hero of _Spider-Man: India_. In this miniseries, the village boy gains mystical spider powers to fight Indian folklore-inspired versions of Venom, Doctor Octopus, and the Green Goblin.

### Silk

  

The other lead character apparently on tap for _Spider-Women_ is Cindy Moon aka Silk. This Korean superheroine was also bitten by the same spider that gave Peter his powers. Cindy gained similar spider abilities, including the far more logical organic webshooters.

### Spiders-Man

  

In an alternate reality Peter Parker fell into an entire vat of modified spiders who absorbed his consciousness. That massive hive mind of arachnids now walks around shaped like a person with Peter’s memory as a superhero called [Spiders-Man](https://www.geek.com/comics/geeksplainer-the-spider-verse-1764165/). It’s a crime this character wasn’t in the first _Spider-Verse_. There’s still time to correct this mistake in the sequel. Either him or that Spider-Man in a cowboy outfit, Web-Slinger.
