By Huw Jones LONDON (Reuters) - PwC earned $42.4 billion in global annual revenues with $3 billion (2.44 billion pounds) going into bolstering skills over the next two years, the "Big Four" accountant said on Tuesday as it faces closer regulatory scrutiny in Britain. Bob Moritz, PwC's global chairman, said the number of employees globally rose 25,000 to 276,000 in its record financial year ended June 30, with headcount in the current period likely to rise at a similar clip. Revenues were up 4.3% from $40.68 billion in fiscal 2018 or 7% in local currency.
