Say hello to the open-source cycling computer that displays heart rate, speed, cadence, and song playback info ([video](https://youtu.be/XeAFPAdH4dI))! [Pyloton](https://learn.adafruit.com/pyloton?view=all) is a CircuitPython bike computer made with the CLUE board. Pyloton measures Bluetooth LE heart rate, speed, and cadence. It also provides Apple Music Service song info, combined on one small device with a sharp display and a 3D printed handlebar mount (or optional wrist mount).

This project is the culmination of three previous Adafruit Learning System projects, plus some new abilities of our Bluefruit code to connect to multiple peripheral devices!

Previously, we created these standalone projects:

*   [Now Playing: Bluetooth LE Apple Media Service Display](https://learn.adafruit.com/now-playing-bluetooth-apple-media-service-display/overview)
*   [BLE Heart Rate Zone Trainer Display](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-ble-heart-rate-monitor-gizmo/overview)
*   [BLE Cycling Speed & Cadence Sensor Display](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluetooth-bicycle-speed-cadence-sensor-display-with-clue/overview)

You may refer to those guides for additional details on the sensors, libraries, and code. Here, weâ€™ll show you how they can all be combined into one device.
