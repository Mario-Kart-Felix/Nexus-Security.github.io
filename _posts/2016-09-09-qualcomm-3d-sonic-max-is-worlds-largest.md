Two years ago it was a 4x9 sensor, now it's a 20x30 sensor, which makes simultaneous two-finger sensing possible offering better security, increased speed and ease of use, compared to previous sensors. On top of that, 3D Sonic Max promises to deliver 1::1,000,000 rather than 1::50,000 in the previous generation to prevent fingerprint spoofing and inaccurate results. The new Qualcomm 3D Sonic Max in-display fingerprint scanner is suitable for automotive as well as smartphones. Samsung could be one of the OEMs to use this in their next-gen flagships, which will likely be the Snapdragon S11 series.  We should know more details about the scanner in the coming days of the Qualcomm Snapdragon Tech Summit.
