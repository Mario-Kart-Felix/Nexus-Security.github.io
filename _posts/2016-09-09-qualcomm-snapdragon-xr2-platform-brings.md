If you didn’t already know, Qualcomm had [unveiled a VR headset reference design](https://beebom.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-845-vr-reference-headset/) earlier last year but we hadn’t gotten any updates in this department – until today. The American chipmaker today committed to making VR/AR headsets mainstream and [launched the new Snapdragon XR2 platform](https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2019/12/05/qualcomm-technologies-announces-worlds-first-5g-xr-platform) at Snapdragon Tech Summit in Hawaii.  

Calling it the _“world’s first 5G-supported extended reality (XR) platform,”_ Qualcomm has said that the Snapdragon XR2 will help enable never seen before experience. It won’t be replacing the company’s existing XR1 platform, which is widely being used in a ton of AR and VR devices. Snapdragon XR1 will continue to be used in current-gen products, while XR2 will bring next-gen features down the road.  

The Snapdragon XR2 platform delivers _“2x the CPU and GPU performance, 4x more video bandwidth, 6x higher resolution, and 11x AI improvement,”_ as per the official blog post. I mean, this seems like a worthy upgrade but Qualcomm boasts that the platform carries a number of other firsts in tow as well.  

In its official blog post, Qualcomm stated that it’s _“the world’s first XR platform to support seven concurrent cameras and a dedicated computer vision processor. Additionally, this is the first XR platform to enable low latency camera pass-through to unlock true MR.”_

Snapdragon XR2 supports display panels with a 3K x 3K resolution at a 90Hz refresh rate for each eye. You can playback 360-degree 8K resolution videos at 60fps on this platform, with HDR10 and HDR10+ support for a more immersive experience. The custom silicon is helping keep the latency super low, thus, making such resolutions a reality.  

In the audio department, Snapdragon XR2 has a new custom-built always-on, low power Hexagon DSP. It supports voice activation, context detection and enables rich, 3D spatial sound on AR/VR headsets. Also, support for seven concurrent cameras makes _“real-time and highly accurate tracking of the head, lips, and eyes together with a 26-point skeletal hand tracking”_ possible.  

Snapdragon XR2 is also packed with some amazing AI goodness, offering 15 TOPS (Tera operations per second) of AI performance. This has enabled **XR2 to support enhanced visuals, interactivity, and audio** experiences but we won’t be able to experience them anytime soon. Qualcomm revealed that its OEM partners have started prototyping AR/VR headsets based on this chipset. They have also committed to commercializing these new headsets but there’s no timeline available just yet.
