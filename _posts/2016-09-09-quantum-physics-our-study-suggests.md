Alternative facts are spreading like a virus across society. Now it seems they have even infected scienceâ€”at least the quantum realm. This may seem counter intuitive. The scientific method is after all founded on the reliable notions of observation, measurement and repeatability. A fact, as established by a measurement, should be objective, such that all observers can agree with it.
