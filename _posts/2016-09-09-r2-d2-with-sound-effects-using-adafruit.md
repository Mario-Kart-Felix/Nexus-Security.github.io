From the [Adafruit Forums](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=157431#p776111), user ganderson is using an Adafruit Music Maker shield and an Arduino Uno to make sound effects and lighting for an R2-D2 build.

Looking for some playback assistance, the trick was to soft reset the VS1053 on the sound board between playing music tracks.

See [the forum post](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=157431#p776111) for details. For your own sound effects board, the [Adafruit Music Maker Shield](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1788) is the one to chose. See it here.
