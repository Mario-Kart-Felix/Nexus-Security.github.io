[Rage 2](https://www.gamespot.com/rage-2/) has received its second major expansion, TerrorMania, which transports you to the "[twisted and cursed alternate reality](https://bethesda.net/en/article/cX7iWXU2VSAXxy1noD0Wz/rage-2-terrormania-expansion)" of the Deadlands to battle a skeleton army. This DLC brings new lands to explore, new enemies, and a sword weapon, the Sword of Transitus. Protagonist Ranger Walker must head into this alternate dimension and look for a way to close the gateway into it before the skeleton armies encroach on the Wasteland from the main game to mess it up even more. The pack will take areas from the main game, like Wellspring and Overgrown City, and present new, warped versions of them, but it'll also feature entirely new areas, such as the Floating Islands and a hospital location.

This is the second of the [two major expansions](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rage-2-post-launch-dlc-calendar-shows-all-the-extr/1100-6466843/) promised for Rage 2, following on from [Rise of the Ghosts](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2019-rage-2-expansion-rise-of-the-ghosts-announ/1100-6467576/) and a major free update that [added New Game+](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/big-rage-2-update-out-now-adds-new-game-ultra-nigh/1100-6468707/). No further DLC has been announced at this time. This DLC can only be accessed through the in-game store, and costs 500 RAGE coins ($5). There's also a deluxe edition, which comes with the Cult of the Death God mission, the Reaper Assault Rifle weapon skin, the Wasteland Celebrity Phoenix vehicle skin, and the Mutant Monster Truck vehicle skin. This costs 1750 RAGE coins ($17.50). Rage 2 recently came to [Xbox Game Pass](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tons-of-new-xbox-game-pass-games-confirmed-some-ou/1100-6471451/), meaning that it's now in the hands of many more Xbox players.  
  
We gave Rage 2 a 6/10 in [our review](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rage-2-review-wasted-land/1900-6417138/). Reviewer Michael Higham wrote: "Rage 2 is at its best when you're given the chance to keep up a gratifying momentum in combat, but struggles to setup the scenarios its combat deserves. It's satisfying in the way clearing out an open-world checklist is, especially because powers are such a joy to use. The disappointment comes from the fact that those activities are rudimentary in nature and the decent ones end well before you get your fill."
