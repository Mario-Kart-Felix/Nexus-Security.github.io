British video game developer Rare, creator of classics like _Battletoads_, _GoldenEye 007_, and _Banjo-Kazooie_,  is revealing its next big game, _Everwild_, at Microsoft's X019 event today. Rare is only providing a small glimpse at _Everwild_,  but the brief trailer makes it look like it's going to be some type of action adventure game.

_Banjo-Kazooie_ fans will have been hoping for a sequel, or at least a new _Banjo_ game, but _Everwild_ looks more like _Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild._ The world is full of different species of animals, all with Rare's classic cartoon-style look and feel. Rare and Microsoft haven't revealed much more about the game, nor when it will be released.

"While _Everwild_ is still early in development, we are very excited about the unique potential of the game we are creating," explains Rare studio head Craig Duncan. "The _Everwild_ team is focused on building an experience that allows for new ways to play in a natural and magical world. _Everwild_ will give you memorable, engaging and meaningful experiences for players everywhere to share. We cannot wait to share more with you in the future."

Rare's previous Xbox One and Windows 10 exclusive, _Sea of Thieves_,  [launched last year](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/13/17003856/sea-of-thieves-game-preview) and the team will continue to work on it and provide updates. It's fair to say it wasn't a smash hit, but it also wasn't a flop either. _Sea of Thieves_ now has a dedicated community of players, but Rare is clearly keen to try something new with _Everwild_ that's not necessarily as service-driven as _Sea of Thieves_.
