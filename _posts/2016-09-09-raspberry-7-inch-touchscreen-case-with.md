> This new design addressed three issues I wasn’t happy with:
> 
> The SD Hatch: Taking of the SD card was too much of a problem. The new port makes it a lot easier.  
> RPI leds: The previous case hidded the RPI leds. There’s now a viewport to allow for viewing.  
> Stand/Mount: there is now a nice mount GoPro style. With it it is easy to adjust viewing angle. It is fully compatible with any GoPro mount you might find.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
