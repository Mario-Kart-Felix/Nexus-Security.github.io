> Who doesn’t love portable computers from the 80’s? Too bulky to call them a laptop yet, but much more luggable than other computers from that era. Of course, the easiest way to get a box started is with aluminum extrusions, some laser cut mounts for a Raspberry Pi 4, and a mechanical keyboard to get you almost done with the basics! Dave has never built a “daily driver” Raspberry Pi build where the SD card doesn’t get reformatted with the next use of the Raspberry Pi.
