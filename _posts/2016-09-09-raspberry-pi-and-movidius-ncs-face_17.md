Cool new tutorial by Adrian Rosebrock at [PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/01/06/raspberry-pi-and-movidius-ncs-face-recognition/).

> In this tutorial you will learn how to use the Movidius NCS to speedup face detection and face recognition on the Raspberry Pi by over 243%!
> 
> If you’ve ever tried to perform deep learning-based face recognition on a Raspberry Pi, you may have noticed significant lag.
> 
> Is there a problem with the face detection or face recognition models themselves?
> 
> No, absolutely not.
> 
> The problem is that your Raspberry Pi CPU simply can’t process the frames quickly enough. You need more computational horsepower.
