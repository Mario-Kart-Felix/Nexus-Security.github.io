> Using the Bare Conductive Pi Cap, Davy Wybiral hooked up his fairy lights and baubles to a Raspberry Pi. The result? Musical baubles that allow the user to play their favourite festive classics at the touch of a finger. These baubles are fantastic, and it’s easy to make your own.
> 
> The code for Bare Conductive’s Pi Cap polyphonic touch MP3 utility can be found [in this GitHub repo](https://github.com/BareConductive/picap-touch-mp3-py), and you can pick up a Pi Cap on [the Bare Conductive website](https://www.bareconductive.com/shop/pi-cap/). Then all you need to do is hook up your favourite tree decorations to the Pi Cap via insulated wires, and you’re good to go. It’s OK if your decorations aren’t conductive: you’ll actually be touching the wires and not the ornaments themselves.
