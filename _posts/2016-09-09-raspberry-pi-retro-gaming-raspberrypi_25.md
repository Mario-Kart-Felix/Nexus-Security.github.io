[RaspberryPi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-retro-gaming-on-reddit/) rounded up some excellent Raspberry Pi retro gaming projects from over the weekend, including this build with Lego bricks!

> u/RealMagicman03 shared the build [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/dklv9n/just_completed_my_mini_arcade_cabinet_that/), so be sure to give them an upvote and leave a comment if, like us, you love Raspberry Pi projects that involve Lego bricks.
