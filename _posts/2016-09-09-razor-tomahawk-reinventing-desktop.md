Razer always pushes the limits when it comes to PC gaming. For the company’s first step into the desktop space, it’s completely changing the way you go about building a desktop computer.

The company is best known for its lines of mice, keyboard, and other gaming peripherals. However, since the release of the Razer Blade laptops, the company has become a major player in the PC device space.

With the announcement of the Razer Tomahawk desktop, the company is clearly looking to revolutionize desktop gaming by making a modular computer that requires almost no technical knowledge to actually build and upgrade.

The Razer Tomahawk is quite a bit smaller than your typical gaming desktop. In fact, it actually looks more like an external GPU enclosure than a full-fledged gaming desktop.

Rather than use a bulky motherboard, Razer is using an Intel NUC Element modular computer, which is obviously substantially smaller than a traditional PC. There’s also no desktop processor included since there’s no traditional motherboard to attach it to. There are slots for memory and storage, Wi-Fi 6 radio, plenty of ports, and everything that makes a gaming PC tick.

Razer has also designed a really sleek enclosure to go with the tiny NUC board. Like most Razer products, it looks really good and features tasteful lights to make your PC stand out from the crowd.

Razer hasn’t provided all of the details for the new PC, but it did say that it hopes to release the full system starting at around $2000 this June. This configuration would include a Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and a yet-to-be-announced RTX 20 GPU. There will also be an upgraded model that features a Core i9 with 64GB of RAM and a GeForce RTX 2080 Super.

Unfortunately, Razer had the PC behind a glass case at CES 2020, so we couldn’t actually take it apart and test the module components for ourselves, but it definitely looked quite promising. Having a gaming PC that takes up minimal space and one that can be upgraded insanely quickly is a pretty exciting proposition for any PC gamer.
