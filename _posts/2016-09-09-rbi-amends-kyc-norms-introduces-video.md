[RBI amends KYC norms, introduces video-based identification process](https://varindia.com/news/rbi-amends-kyc-norms-introduces-videobased-identification-process#.XhwPLVuma4Q.blogger): The RBI has amended the KYC norms which will allow banks and other lending institutions regulated by it to use Video based Customer Identification Process (V-CIP). The move will help the institutions to onboard customers remotely. The V-CIP will be consent-based and will make it easier for banks and other regulated entities to adhere to the RBIâ€™s Know Your Customer (KYC) norms by leveraging the digital technology.
