![](https://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/realme-X2-Pro_fonearena-14-1024x590.jpg) Realme RMX2071, a new smartphone powered by Snapdragon 865 (SM8250) 5G mobile platform with Adreno 650 GPU has surfaced on AnTuTu. This shows whopping 5,74,985 scores, which is the best till date, and is even better than upcoming Mi 10 scores of 560,000 from the same SoC. This is said to launch as realme X50 Pro 5G, which should be the company's first flagship phone for this year. We don't have any other specifications of the phone yet, but we can expect 8GB or 12GB of RAM, improved cameras, 120Hz refresh rate screen and possibly 50W fast charging. realme already said that it will launch 5G smartphones with Qualcomm Snapdragon 5G SoC in 2020 in India. The phone is expected to be unveiled at MWC next month during its 5G launch event on February 24 at 10 AM CEST (1:30PM IST). We should know more details about the smartphone in the coming weeks.
