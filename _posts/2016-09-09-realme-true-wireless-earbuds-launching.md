The launch event is expected to be scheduled in the third week of this month. We should know the exact date soon. Earlier: Realme launched the most expected realme X2 Pro smartphone in India today along with the realme 5s smartphone, but it did not announce any other new accessories. However, at the end of the event Realme CEO Madhav Sheth showed of the company's first wireless earbuds. As you can see, the earbuds looks similar to the Apple Airpods, but it is in yellow color that goes with the company's yellow colored branding. He also said that the company plans to launch several products, so we can expect realme Fitness Band that was teased earlier. The company might be working on VOOC PowerBanks for the future. The Realme earbuds will be introduced along with the realme XT 730G (X2) next month. It is not clear if we can expect the rumored realme 6 as well. We will have to wait for few more weeks to know the exact launch date.
