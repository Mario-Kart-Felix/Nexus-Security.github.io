Realme is all set to release its upcoming flagship Realme X2 Pro in China on October 15, and today, the company’s CEO Madhav Sheth has confirmed in a tweet that the device will be making its way to India in December this year.  

That seems like a pretty long wait, but it may well be a wait worth having. The Realme X2 Pro looks like it’ll be a great flagship device, with the company having confirmed some top-of-the-line specs for it. There will be the [Snapdragon 855+ and a 90Hz display](https://beebom.com/realme-x2-pro-launch-teased-snapdragon-855-90hz-display-confirmed/) in tow on the phone — something that’s almost become a trend with flagships these days. The company has also confirmed that the device will come with [dual stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support](https://beebom.com/realme-x2-dual-stereo-speakers/), a 64MP primary rear camera, and 50W charging support on the X2 Pro.

Apart from that, we got a look at the Realme X2 Pro thanks to a Realme executive posting a poster for the phone on [Weibo](https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4425122842633269) where we can see the quad camera set-up on the back, along with a gradient finish.  

Earlier, we got some more details about the upcoming Realme flagship courtesy of a TENAA listing of the phone among other leaks, which showed the device having a 6.5-inch FullHD display, with an in-display fingerprint scanner and a 16MP selfie shooter.  

The launch event for the Realme X2 Pro is set for October 15 at 10AM in China, and we’ll be covering the launch, so stay tuned.
