[Red Dead Redemption 2](https://www.gamespot.com/red-dead-redemption-2/)'s biggest PC update so far is now available to download. [As promised](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-red-dead-2-pc-update-coming-soon-rockstar-apol/1100-6471408/), update 1.14 implements fixes for the stuttering issue caused by certain configurations of Nvidia GPUs and four- and six-core CPUs. Rockstar has also issued a workaround while it collaborates with Nvidia to permanently solve the issue, along with introducing a host of other fixes.

The temporary workaround for the stuttering problem uses a command line to slightly re-balance and ease the load on the CPU. If you've run into the problem yourself, Rockstar has a [support page](https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/360038940333/Graphics-stuttering-or-stalling-in-Red-Dead-Redemption-2-on-PC) explaining how to add the command and potentially fix the issue for the time being.

The update also brings a plethora of improvements to graphics, performance, stability, control, UI, and general bug fixes. The [full patch notes](https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/360038342293/RDR2-Title-Update-1-14-Notes-PS4-Xbox-One-PC) can be found below:
