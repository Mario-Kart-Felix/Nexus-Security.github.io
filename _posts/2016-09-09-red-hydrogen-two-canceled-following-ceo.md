After the spectacular failure of its ambitious [RED Hydrogen One](https://beebom.com/red-hydrogen-one-unboxing/) holographic smartphone last year, the company known for high-end cinematic cameras was still planning to put a high-quality Pro 3D camera on a smartphone, according to an official announcement from RED founder and CEO, Jim Jannard, earlier this year. That project, however, has now officially been shut down, with the 70-year-old Jannard announcing his retirement from the company a few hours ago, citing health reasons.  

Jannard earlier today took to the Hydrogen user forums, [saying](https://h4vuser.net/t/everything-changes/10600): _“I will be shutting down the HYDROGEN project, ending a career that has included Oakley, RED Digital Cinema and HYDROGEN. I am very proud to have worked with many great people over the years who have signed on to the vision”_. He, however, did assure buyers of the original Hydrogen ONE that their device _“will continue to be supported in the future”_, although, it’s not immediately clear for how long.  

The announcement comes as a surprise, because as recently as July, [Jannard had announced](https://beebom.com/red-founder-confirms-hydrogen-two/) that the company was working on the Hydrogen Two that he said will include a high-quality Pro 3D camera. He also said that the company is working on radically changing the Hydrogen program with a _‘new and extraordinary sensor’_ to better satisfy pro photographers as well as casual consumers.  

He had earlier announced that the company was working on _‘radically changing the Hydrogen program’_ as part of his plans to offer a better device to users. According to him, _“The changes create new opportunities to better satisfy the professional image capture customers as well as the casual consumer for the HYDROGEN program”_. Those plans, unfortunately, have now been shelved, and the Hydrogen Two is now a closed chapter.
