Redmi India’s official Twitter handle has confirmed that it is indeed rolling out MIUI 11 to Redmi 7A users in the country. However, as is the case with most software updates, this is a staged rollout so it might take a couple of days for the update to show up for your device. That said, if you want to try your luck, you can check for updates manually as well.  

Xiaomi has so far rolled out MIUI 11 to 27 devices, according to tweets made by the company.
