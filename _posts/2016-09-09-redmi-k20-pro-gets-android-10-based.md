Xiaomi has reportedly started rolling out the Android 10-based MIUI 10 stable update to the Redmi K20 Pro in India. According to multiple posts on the [official MIUI forums](https://in.c.mi.com/thread-1977651-1-0.html), the company began the rollout of the stable MIUI 10.4.8 update earlier this week. It comes in at 2.2GB and with the build number MIUI v10.4.8 QFKINXM. The report comes a couple of weeks after the company was said to have [rolled out a ‘stable beta’ build](https://beebom.com/xiaomi-k20-pro-android-10-update/) of the software in China.  

The update comes with a number of new features including gesture-based navigation, notification actions, prioritized notifications, and of course, the much-awaited native dark mode. According to the rather curtailed official changelog that mentions only two changes, the update also fixes an issue that caused the phone to erratically reboot when full-screen gestures were enabled.

As is the case with most OTA updates, this one, too, is being rolled out in batches, which means not everyone will get it on their devices immediately. While you will be notified once the update is available on your device, you can also check for it manually by going over to the Settings menu.  

One of the most notable new features in the incoming update is the gesture navigation that enables people to use swipe gestures instead of the navigation buttons to navigate the phone’s UI. Another interesting new addition is ‘notification actions’ that brings contextual suggestions for incoming notifications without opening the app, enabling users to not only read, but also reply to messages without opening the app.
