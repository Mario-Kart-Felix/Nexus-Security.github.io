![](https://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Redmi-K30-1024x524.jpg) Xiaomi's Redmi brand already confirmed 5G support for the Redmi K30. Redmi General Manager, Lu Weibing, today at the Redmi 8 and 8A launch in China confirmed that the K30 will be feature dual punch-hole front cameras. We had already seen a similar setup in Samsung Galaxy S10+ smartphone earlier this year. This will also be the first Redmi phone to support a punch-hole display. This will also come with support for 5G stand alone and non-stand alone (SA/NSA) sub-6GHz networks. Last month Qualcomm announced expansion of 5G support for older 7 Series and 6 Series in 2020, so the K30 could use Snapdragon 7 series 5G Mobile Platform with support for both SA and NSA dual mode 5G. We still don't have any other specifications of the phone, but we can expect in-display fingerprint scanner, improved cameras and possibly a bigger battery since it has 5G support. Source 1, 2
