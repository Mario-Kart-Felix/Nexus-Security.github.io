With 2019 coming to a close, the rumor mill suggests we will see a ton of 5G smartphones launch next year. Almost every phone maker will board the 5G hype train in 2020 – [unlike the few we saw this year](https://beebom.com/best-5g-phones/). Redmi K30 with a dual punch-hole display (similar to the [Galaxy S10 Plus](https://beebom.com/galaxy-s10-plus-review/)) and 5G support has been [known to be in the works](https://beebom.com/redmi-k30-dual-punch-hol-5g-shown-off/) for some time now. However, it is today that Redmi K30’s launch timeline has been confirmed by Xiaomi.  

Lu Weibing, Vice President of Xiaomi Group [took to Weibo](https://www.weibo.com/1892653244/IgkBKpLGY?filter=hot&root_comment_id=0&type=comment#_rnd1573863702742) to confirm that Redmi K30 will be launched in 2020. He shared the news of [Redmi K20 Pro](https://beebom.com/redmi-k20-pro-miui-11-update-rolling-out/) bagging the top spot in the sub-3,000 yuan (around Rs. 30,0000) segment at the China Mobile Worldwide Partner Conference.  

He continues to add, _“Redmi in the 5G era will continue to adhere to high quality and will overcome a series of difficulties \[associated\] with 5G early adoption._ _But, it will bring the best quality Xiaomi \[to users, with 5G support in tow\]._”  

Looking forward to the future, Weibing ended his Weibo post (roughly translated from Chinese) with **“2020. Redmi will be a 5G pioneer. K30 see!”** This implies that the Redmi K20 successor could be coming sooner than expected – possibly in the first quarter of 2020. Redmi K30 will be the **first Redmi phone to host a punch-hole display** and support SA/NSA dual-mode 5G connectivity.  

Qualcomm is [prepping the launch](https://beebom.com/5g-capable-snapdragon-600-700-chips-2020/) of 5G-enabled Snapdragon 600 and 700-series chipsets to bring 5G connectivity to mid-range phones. Rumored to be the Snapdragon 735, it will offer performance better than the existing gaming-centric Snapdragon 730G chipset and an integrated 5G modem onboard. We recently learned that Nokia 8.2 with a pop-up camera and 5G support might be [shown off](https://beebom.com/nokia-8-1-launch-expected-mwc-2020/) at MWC 2020, but it won’t be the only one.  

Xiaomi co-founder and CEO Lei Jun [recently said](https://beebom.com/xiaomi-5g-phones-2020/) that every Xiaomi devices launching next year at a price-point of 2,000 yuan (~Rs. 20000) or above will come with 5G connectivity. This suggests that Xiaomi’s mid-range offerings will come with 5G support but it would be great to see the company bring the technology to the masses with the next Redmi Note smartphone. A 5G-enabled Redmi Note 8 Pro successor. All in favor of this idea, drop an “Aye” down in the comments section. Also, let us know how excited are you for the Redmi K30.
