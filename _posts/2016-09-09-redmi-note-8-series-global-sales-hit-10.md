The Redmi Note series continues to be a [major money-spinner for Xiaomi](https://beebom.com/xiaomi-largest-offline-brand-india/), thanks largely to its incredible value-for-money proposition. The latest devices in the lineup, the [Redmi Note 8](https://beebom.com/redmi-note-8-launched-price-specs-features/) and the [Redmi Note 8 Pro](https://beebom.com/redmi-note-8-pro-launched-price-specs-features/), are seemingly no exception. The company has today officially announced that the Redmi Note 8 series has together **registered sales of more than 10 million (1 crore) units globally** since its launch last August.  

According to Xiaomi, its latest Redmi Note series hit the 10 million mark in just 3 months, which is faster than its predecessor, the Redmi Note 7 lineup, which is said to have hit the mark after 4 months of being on the market. The Note 7 series has since [crossed the 20 million mark](https://www.bgr.in/news/xiaomi-redmi-note-7-series-sales-surpass-20-million-units-globally-redmi-note-8-india-launch-on-october-9-852737/), after hitting the 10 million milestone back in May. As for the Redmi Note 8 series, it’s said to have **sold 110,000 units per day** since its launch earlier this year.  

Redmi Note 8 series has received a warm reception not only in China but also in India, with the company reportedly [shipping over 1 million units](https://beebom.com/redmi-note-8-pro-sales-numbers-india/) of the devices within just one month of[ launch](https://beebom.com/redmi-note-8-launched-price-specs-features/). It will now be interesting to see if the company will be able to maintain this momentum in the segment with the launch of [new and competitive offerings from Realme](https://beebom.com/realme-x50-dual-mode-5g-confirmed/) and other brands.  

Meanwhile, Xiaomi is celebrating the achievement by offering a 100 yuan (around Rs. 1,000) discount on the 6GB + 128GB version of the Redmi Note 8 Pro in China. The reduced price of 1,299 yuan (around Rs. 13,000) will be applicable only for a limited period, said the company.
