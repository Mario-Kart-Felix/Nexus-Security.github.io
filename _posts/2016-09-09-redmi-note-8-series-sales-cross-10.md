![](https://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Redmi-Note-8-Pro_fonearena-05-1024x569.jpg) Xiaomi’s Redmi brand introduced  Redmi Note 8 and Note 8 Pro smartphones in China back in August, and the phones were launched in India in October. Today the company has announced that the combined sales of Redmi Note 8 and Note 8 Pro have hit 10 million units globally in just 3 months, which is 1 month less time compared to the Redmi Note 7 series. Last week the company announced that it has sold 1 million or 10 lakh units of Redmi Note 8 series in India in 1 month. To celebrate this the company is offering 100 yuan discount on the Redmi Note 8 6GB + 128GB version, which is available for 1299 yuan (US$ 184 / Rs. 13,250 approx.) for limited period, but it is still cheaper in India at Rs. 12,999. The company has also announced that it will reveal more details about the Redmi K30 phones tomorrow, ahead of launch on December 10th. The company recently denied rumors about the existence of new version of Redmi Note 8 Pro with Snapdragon 730G processor and 27W fast charging, which was said to compete with the realme XT 730G (X2) that is launching in India later this month.
