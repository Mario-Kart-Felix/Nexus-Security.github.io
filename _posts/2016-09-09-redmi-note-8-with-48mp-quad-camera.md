Alongside the launch of the Redmi Note 8 Pro, Xiaomi also unveiled its younger sibling in India. The Redmi Note 8 has also debuted in India today and well, it’s a successor to the Redmi Note 7 (or Redmi Note 7S) that continues to provide a 48MP camera to the users, but with a more powerful chipset, new design and quad-cameras in tow.  

Redmi Note 8: Specs and Features
--------------------------------

  

Redmi Note 8 features the same glass construction as its elder sibling, with the Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection both on the front and back. The Aura Design philosophy, now dubbed the Aura Fluid design is in play here as well. And you will see that Note 8’s color variant and gradient pattern are different as compared to the Note 8 Pro.  

This smartphone sports a **slightly smaller** **6.3-inch Full-HD+ LTPS LCD display** as compared to the Note 8 Pro. It boasts a 90% screen-to-body ratio (which is still pretty high), 2340×1080 pixels resolution, and 19.5:9 aspect ratio.

Under the hood, Redmi Note 8 is **powered by the same chipset as Xiaomi’s latest Android One smartphone** – [the Mi A3](https://beebom.com/xiaomi-mi-a3-launched-india/). This means Snapdragon 665 chipset runs the show on this device, coupled with up to 6GB RAM and 128GB storage (expandable via dedicated microSD card slot). It too runs Android 9 Pie-based MIUI 10 out-of-the-box, however, you should receive the MIUI 11 update before the end of this year.
