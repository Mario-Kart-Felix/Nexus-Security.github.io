Redmi had been teasing the launch of a [new product category](https://beebom.com/redmi-9a-power-bank-india-launch-date/) over the past week. And well, we did guess it right. The Chinese giant has **today launched Redmi-branded power banks**, which were [first launched in China](https://beebom.com/redmi-powerbanks-launched-china/) last year, alongside the entry-level Redmi 8A Dual in India. It has unveiled two variants of the new Redmi power banks – [10,000mAh](https://store.mi.com/in/item/3200600004) and [20,000mAh](https://store.mi.com/in/item/3200600003) at affordable prices.  

Specs and Features
------------------

  

Talking about the design first, the Redmi power banks feature a polycarbonate body and have an anti-slip EdgeGrip design (ridges on the edges) for a more reliable grip. You are going to find four ports on one of the edges and a power button on the other. Both of the power banks feature a Li-Polymer battery.  

The stand out feature of both the Redmi power banks is that they feature dual-input and dual-output ports. The former obviously includes a microUSB port (for entry-level users) and USB Type-C port (for budget or premium users) whereas the latter are two standard USB Type-A ports.

Now, these two power banks do come with **some minor differences**. The 10,000mAh power bank supports 10W fast-charging whereas the 20,000mAh power bank supports 18W fast-charging. You can charge the power banks using either the microUSB or USB Type-C port.  

The 10,000mAh power bank supports charging at 5V/ 2.1A using either the microUSB or USB Type-C port and can charge other devices at up to 5.1V/ 2.6A. The 20,000mAh power bank, on the other hand, supports charging at up to 9V/ 2.1A, 12V/ 1.5A and can charge other devices at up to 5.1V/ 2.4A, 5.1V/3.6A, 9V/ 2A, 12V/ 1.5A.  

Redmi boasts that the power banks feature nine different protections to safeguard the power bank or user’s devices while charging. The power banks also support low-power mode for charging smaller accessories like a fitness band, Bluetooth headset, and more.  

Price and Availability

The 10,000mAh Redmi Power Bank is **priced at Rs. 799** whereas the 20,000mAh Power Bank is priced at Rs 1,499 in India. It will go on sale from February 18 and comes in two colors – Black and White.
