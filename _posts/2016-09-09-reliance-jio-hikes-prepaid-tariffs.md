Following [steep price hikes](https://beebom.com/airtel-vodafone-jio-hike-tariffs-india/) from both Airtel and Vodafone Idea, Reliance Jio on Wednesday also announced plans to increase its prepaid tariffs by up to 40 percent, [its second in just over a month](https://beebom.com/jio-launches-all-in-one-plans/). The new all-in-one (AIO) tariff plans start at Rs. 199 for 28-days and go up to Rs 2,199 for 1-year. All of them offer unlimited on-net (Jio to Jio) voice calls and 100 daily SMSes, but differ in their validity periods, daily data allocations and off-net (Jio to non-Jio) voice calling minutes.

----------------------------

  

In addition, there are also a couple of long-terms plans with 365-day validity periods. The first one has been priced at **Rs. 2,199,** and it comes with 1.5GB high-speed daily data, unlimited Jio-to-Jio calls and 12,000 non-Jio minutes. The other 12-month plan comes with a **Rs. 1,299** price-tag and, offers 24GB of total high-speed data, unlimited Jio-to-Jio calls and 12,000 minutes of off-net voice calling.  

Jio ‘Affordable’ All-in-One Plans
---------------------------------

  

Reliance Jio has also introduced so-called ‘affordable’ plans for folks with less data requirements. The cheapest of the lot costs **Rs. 129** and, offers 2GB of total high-speed data, unlimited Jio-to-Jio calls and 1,000 minutes of non-Jio voice calls for 28 days. There is also the **Rs. 329** plan with 6GB of total high-speed data, unlimited Jio-to-Jio calls, and 3,000 minutes of non-Jio voice calling for 84 days.  

Finally, users in need of more data may recharge with the new **Rs. 349** voucher, which comes with 3GB of daily data and 1,000 non-Jio minutes for a period of 28-days. The new plans will go into effect from Thursday, December 6, which means users still have a day to save some money by recharging with the existing Prepaid Vouchers.
