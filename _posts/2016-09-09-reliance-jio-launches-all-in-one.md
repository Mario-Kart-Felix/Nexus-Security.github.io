After All-in-one plans, today it has introduced all in-one pre-paid plans for JioPhone users that offers voice, SMS, Apps, data, as well as free additional 500 minutes of off-net IUC calling to additional operators worth Rs. 40 with 28 days of validity.

All these plans will work only for JioPhone users when the SIM is in JioPhone.
