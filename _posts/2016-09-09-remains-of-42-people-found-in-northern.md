MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican authorities have found the remains of 42 people in a vacant lot in the northern border state of Sonora, a group dedicated to finding missing people said on Tuesday. "That was the last we could find, they've stopped us from searching because there have been a lot of bodies," said Ceci Flores, the leader of Madres Buscadoras de Sonora, a group of mothers in Sonora trying to locate missing loved ones.
