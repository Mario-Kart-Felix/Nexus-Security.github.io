Thanks to Ian for sending us this tip! From [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468067218300208) via [MachineDesign](https://www.machinedesign.com/3d-printing-cad/article/21836893/recycle-at-home-with-3d-printing):

> The device design takes advantage of both the open source hardware methodology and the paradigm developed by the open source self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printer community. Specifically, this paper describes the design, fabrication and operation of a RepRapable Recyclebot, which refers to the Recyclebot’s ability to provide the filament needed to largely replicate the parts for the Recyclebot on any type of RepRap 3-D printer.
