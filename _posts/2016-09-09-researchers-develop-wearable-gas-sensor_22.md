> A highly sensitive, wearable gas sensor for environmental and human health monitoring may soon become commercially available, according to researchers at Penn State and Northeasten University.
> 
> The sensor is more advanced than existing wearable sensors due to its self-heating mechanism that enhances sensitivity, which allows for quick recovery and reuse of the device.
> 
> “People like to use nanomaterials for sensing because their large surface-to-volume ratio makes them highly sensitive,” said Huanyu Cheng, Assistant Professor of Engineering Science and Mechanics and Materials Science and Engineering at Penn State.
> 
> “The problem is the nanomaterial is not something we can easily hook up to with wires to receive the signal, necessitating the need for something called interdigitated electrodes, which are like the digits on your hand.”
