Security researchers identified seven new malicious apps present on Google Play Store that infect devices with adware and malware while laying open the system's backdoor access which ensures a smooth installation of any new functionality that comes along with the application. Other threats include battery drainage and excessive consumption of mobile data.  
  
In recent times, with the mobile malware penetrating its roots in the cyber world, there have been a number of new discoveries from security researchers where they warn of malicious android apps that request sketchy permissions and contain malware. Android platform's openness, flexibility, and excess control are the key factors which make it even more attractive to the users and likewise, cybercriminals. As a downside, it also provides a more vulnerable space for criminals to exploit by posting adware infected apps to serve marketing interests and steal sensitive user data. These apps can take different forms and mostly, share a similar code structure which indicates a direct link between the developers.  
  
These malicious apps are configured to download and consequently install APKs from a GitHub repository, hence attackers are handling the GitHub communication very sophisticatedly, as a part of which they effectively wait to bypass detection by security officers and malware detection agencies.  
  
Attackers have embedded a GitHub URL within the malicious app code which sets the basis for evading Google Play protect scan. However, while security researchers somehow managed to unearth the configuration data of the malicious apps and related URLs, they were directed to Adware APK which is triggered right after the installation of the infected app. The APK halts for a timeframe of 10 minutes after being triggered to execute the malicious motives.  
  
Here, the aforementioned malicious apps have been posted by three different developers as listed below:  
  
iSoft LLC (Developer) – Alarm Clock, Calculator, Free Magnifying Glass  
PumpApp (Developer) – Magnifying Glass, Super Bright LED Flashlight  
LizotMitis (Developer) – Magnifier, Magnifying Glass with Flashlight, Super-bright Flashlight  
  
As a security measure for the continuously expanding mobile malware, Google tied up with various mobile security companies that would assist them in detecting bad apps before they hit a download mark over million. Users who have already installed these dropper apps are recommended to uninstall them manually.
