[Star Wars Jedi:](https://www.gamespot.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/) [Fallen Order](https://www.gamespot.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/) is upon us, having launched on PC, PS4, and Xbox One. It's also a Friday, so odds are that if you're a huge fan and you're not playing, it's because you have to head into the office or school. Perhaps you'll play all weekend, and find yourself wishing that you could keep going on Monday--not everyone was lucky enough to [get an early copy](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-copies-are-in-the-wild/1100-6471420/). Luckily, Respawn has you covered--assuming that your boss is very gullible.

Respawn has tweeted out a "sick note" from BD-1, Cal Kestis's droid companion from the new Jedi action game. Our robot translation skills are a little rusty so we're not sure exactly what it says, and odds are your boss won't either. If you're a big Star Wars fan, though, perhaps they'll sympathize.

> Feeling unwell today? Head feeling a bit Force-sensitive right now? Maybe even coming down with a bad case of the Kashyyyks?  
> Please present this note to whoever needs it, excusing you from any duties expected of you through 11/15. Get some rest. ðŸ˜‰ [pic.twitter.com/y47FIceWY4](https://t.co/y47FIceWY4)
