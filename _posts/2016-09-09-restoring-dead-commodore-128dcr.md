Another day, another retro computer lovingly restored to like-new condition by \[Drygol\]. This time, the subject of his attention is a Commodore 128DCR that earned every bit of the “For Parts, Not Working” condition it was listed under. From a spider infestation to a cracked power supply PCB, this computer was in quite a state. But in the end [he got the three decade old machine back in working condition](https://retrohax.net/commodore-c128-dcr-broken-psu-fix-and-a-quick-refurb/) and even managed to teach it a few new tricks along the way.

Interestingly, the machine still had its warranty seal in place on the back, so whatever happened to this PSU seems to have occurred without human intervention.

Rather than just replacing the PSU, \[Drygol\] first pieced the board back together with the help of cyanoacrylate glue, and then coated the top with an epoxy resin to give it some mechanical strength. On the back side the traces were either repaired or replaced entirely with jumper wires where the damage was too severe.

With the PSU repaired and tested, he moved on to cleaning the computer’s main board and whitening all the plastic external components. Even the individual keycaps took a bath to get them looking like new again. This put the computer in about as close to like-new condition as it could get.

But why stop there? He next installed the JiffyDOS modification to improve system performance, and wired in an adapter that lets the computer output a crisp 80 columns over S-Video. It’s safe to say this particular Commodore is in better shape now than it was when it rolled off the assembly line.

While an impressive enough final result, this is still fairly tame for \[Drygol\]. If you want to see a real challenge, take a look at the insane amount of work that went into [recreating this smashed Atari 800XL case](https://hackaday.com/2018/07/15/incredible-atari-800xl-case-restoration/).
