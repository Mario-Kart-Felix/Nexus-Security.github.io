Hi â€” we're Retool ([https://retool.com](https://retool.com)), a fast way of building internal tools. We launched on HN around a year ago ([https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17725966](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17725966)). We're a small team based in Hayes Valley, San Francisco, CA.

Business-wise, we're profitable, growing quickly, and well-capitalized. (We recently raised a Series A from Sequoia. Other investors include technical founders, including Paul Graham, John + Patrick Collison, Nat Friedman, Greg Brockman, etc.)

Culture-wise, we're a small group who enjoys solving problems and working hard. We work closely with customers, and iterate quickly. We spend our days typically either writing code or talking with customers.

The market for custom enterprise apps is huge. And we think that we have a promising shot at capturing much of it: we have a product that works, that customers love (go talk to any customer!), and whose usage is growing rapidly.

We've significantly de-risked the business (e.g. have significant revenue, have a good amount of paying customers, have raised $20M from Sequoia, are profitable, etc.). But there's plenty of stuff to figure out as well. For example:

```
 - How can we quickly ship new products while keeping current customers happy? - How do we design the UI/UX for a new programming environment? - How do we concisely explain what Retool is, without a 4 minute demo video (https://retool.com)? 
```We're hiring for many roles, including engineering, sales, developer relations, customer support + success. We think you'd be a good fit at Retool if you enjoy:```
 - building things, - deciding what to work on, independently, and - getting things done + managing yourself
