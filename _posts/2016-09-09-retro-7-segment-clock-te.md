> I always wanted to make on thatâ€™s closer to the horizontal design than the SE turned out and here it is. Also this is the only one where all digits including the dots do fit on a 200mm wide print bed.
> 
> Itâ€™s done a few days nowâ€¦ I just couldnâ€™t get motivated to build it to take some pictures. So thereâ€™s more renderings than pictures. But as electronics are the same as on the other ones there should be plenty of documentation already on the original thing and its remixes.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And donâ€™t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!

The [Adafruit Learning System](http://learn.adafruit.com) has dozens of great tools to get you well on your way to creating incredible works of engineering, interactive art, and design with your 3D printer! If youâ€™ve made a cool project that combines 3D printing and electronics, be sure to let us know, and weâ€™ll [feature](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) it here!
