> After several months of research and work, the final result is finally here. The whole thing will cost me about 150 € although I did a lot of recovery.  
> The whole is based on a raspberry pi 3 b + under recalbox in the carcass of a Minitel Matra M1. The screen is a first price 8 “brand Eyoyo bought on Ebay.I removed the frame of the screen to get it in and put its speakers on the sides with grates printed in 3d. , I use a socket of ps3 (of recovery) that I soldered to a quad socket 4 taken for simplicity For the joysticks, I used a Quimat brand pack available for twenty euros on Amazon Finally, I use a USB hub that comes out on the right side to be able to connect other controllers and therefore, play several.  
> Although I have no experience, I am very proud of the result; I do not know if I would do another

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!

The [Adafruit Learning System](http://learn.adafruit.com) has dozens of great tools to get you well on your way to creating incredible works of engineering, interactive art, and design with your 3D printer! If you’ve made a cool project that combines 3D printing and electronics, be sure to let us know, and we’ll [feature](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) it here!
