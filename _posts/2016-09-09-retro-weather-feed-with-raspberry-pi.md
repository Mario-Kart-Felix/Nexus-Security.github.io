Once upon a time every channel didn’t have its own set of scripted and non-scripted content. MTV just had music videos and the Weather Channel just had weather. Local news would update every ten minutes with a simple, dual-colored screen filled with big white block letters that let you know the local conditions.

[Dan Maloney](https://hackaday.com/author/dpsm64/ "Posts by Dan Maloney")‘s made a Raspberry Pi-based project that creates the days of yore, when a channel just did one thing over and over and over again. More from [hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2020/02/21/relive-the-glory-days-of-cable-tv-with-this-retro-weather-feed/):

> It’s the product of \[probnot\] and consists of a simple Python program that runs on a Raspberry Pi. Being from Winnipeg, \[probnot\] is tapping into Environment Canada for local weather data, but it should be easy enough to modify to use your local weather provider’s API. The screen is full of retro goodness, from the simple color scheme to the blocky white text; the digital clock and local news crawl at the bottom complete the old school experience. It doesn’t appear that the code supports the period-correct smooth jazz saxophone, but that too should be a simple modification.
