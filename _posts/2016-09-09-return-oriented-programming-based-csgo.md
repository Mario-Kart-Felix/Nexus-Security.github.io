ROP based CSGO, BF3, BF4 cheat

[](https://github.com/Speedi13/ROP-COMPILER#what-is-rop)What is ROP
===================================================================

The Wikipedia article about it describes it best:

> Return-oriented programming (ROP) is a computer security exploit technique that allows an attacker to execute code in the presence of security defenses such as executable space protection and code signing.\[1\]
> 
> In this technique, an attacker gains control of the call stack to hijack program control flow and then executes carefully chosen machine instruction sequences that are already present in the machine's memory, called "gadgets".\[2\] Each gadget typically ends in a return instruction and is located in a subroutine within the existing program and/or shared library code. Chained together, these gadgets allow an attacker to perform arbitrary operations on a machine employing defenses that thwart simpler attacks.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented\_programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming)

The TL;DR is that return-oriented programming (ROP) is a commonly used technique in exploitation to gain code execution  

look below at [Compiler output](https://github.com/Speedi13/ROP-COMPILER/blob/master/README.md#compiler-output)

[](https://github.com/Speedi13/ROP-COMPILER#why-rop)Why ROP
===========================================================

CSGO is protected by Valve Anti-Cheat (short VAC)  
BF3 and BF4 are protected by PunkBuster (short PB)  
ROP should be very difficult to detect for these Anti-Cheats for the following reasons  

*   The cheats program code consists of a list of volatile memory addresses that change with each game and computer restart
*   Afaik VAC prefers to analyze memory pages that are marked as executable but for ROP the list of return-addresses doesn't require to be on an executable memory page.
*   Additionally the ROP-Compiler supports the option of inserting random padding into the ROP-chain.

  
So hopefully this cheat will be VAC / PB undetected for ever ðŸ˜‰

The instruction set is very limited and can be found in the [\>>Gadgets.h<<](https://github.com/Speedi13/ROP-COMPILER/blob/master/RopCompiler/Gadgets.h) header  

### [](https://github.com/Speedi13/ROP-COMPILER#compare-two-values)Compare two values

it's very rare to find a comparison instruction followed by a return, so I am using a trick:

```
;//if ( ECX != 0x28 ) goto l\_skip mov  eax,  0x28 sub  eax,  ecx;//COMPARE EAX, ECX jne l\_skip
```

a substraction in x86 also effects the flags.  
so for example:

```
mov  eax,  0x1 mov  ecx,  0x1 sub  eax,  ecx
```

the ZeroFlag will be set to 1 by the substraction instruction.

```

#### [](https://github.com/Speedi13/ROP-COMPILER#writing-to-virtual-registers)Writing to Virtual Registers

note that ebx can't be written directly to a virtual register  
  
the compiler will translate it to (each line a single gadget)  

```
xchg  eax,  ecx pop  ebx ;//load virtual register address from stack mov DWORD PTR\[ebx\],  eax xchg  eax,  ecx
```

### [](https://github.com/Speedi13/ROP-COMPILER#jumps)Jumps

note that a jump overwrites the ebx register!  
look at the function `addJumpToRopChain` but basically its using a conditional move

```
mov  ebx, @l\_Start cmovne  esp,ebx
```

only that a conditional move directly to esp is very rare so it's utilizing exchange instructions to be able to use a more commonly used instruction like this:

```
mov  ebx, @l\_Start xchg  ecx,  ebx mov  eax, @l\_continue543 cmovne  eax,ecx xchg  ecx,  ebx xchg  eax,  ebp @l\_continue543:
```

using the tool ReClass you can look inspect memory and look at the generated rop-chain  

### [](https://github.com/Speedi13/ROP-COMPILER#raw-thread-stack)Raw thread stack

This is how the generated thread-stack (ROP-Chain) looks like:

Now on the right I added the assembler code that is at each address:

### [](https://github.com/Speedi13/ROP-COMPILER#ret-instruction)ret instruction

the return instruction is essential for ROP.  
The CPU jumps ( by setting the InstructionPointer \[on x86 EIP\] ) to an address it reads from the stack  
to help understanding the instruction this how the CPU processes the `ret` instruction:

```
void Ret( ) { Eip = \*(DWORD\*)( Esp + 0x000000 ); Esp = Esp + 4; }
```

### [](https://github.com/Speedi13/ROP-COMPILER#pop-instruction)pop instruction

gadgets for pop instructions are easy to find and can be used to set a register to a certain value  
to help understanding the instruction this how the CPU processes the `pop eax` instruction:  

```
void PopEAX( ) { Eax = \*(DWORD\*)( Esp + 0x000000 ); Esp = Esp + 4; Eip = Eip + 1; }
```

### [](https://github.com/Speedi13/ROP-COMPILER#jumps-in-rop)jumps in ROP

in ROP the stack pointer ESP becomes the instruction pointer so by changing it follwed by a return instruction a jump happens  
to do conditional jumps a conditional move instruction can be used:

```
//Unsigned Conditional Jump // JE - JZ - Equal/zero - ZF = 1 if ( memcmp( C, "je", 2 ) == 0 || memcmp( C, "jz", 2 ) == 0 ) { //"cmove esp,ebx" addJumpToRopChain( p, C, 2, "cmove" ); continue; }
```

for unconditional jumps a `pop esp` or a `xchg esp, ebx` can be used
