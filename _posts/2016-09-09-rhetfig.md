The interactive graphic over to the left randomly generates figures, with their taxonomic, cognitive, and linguistic affiliations.

The blue link shows the Cognitive Affinit(y/ies) of the figure.

The green link shows the Linguistic Domain(s) of the figure.

The orange link shows the Taxonomic Class of the figure.

This (beta-version) site charts rhetorical figures and their interactions, largely around the chiastic suite, figures of inverse repetition ("I meant what I said and I said what I meant—an elephant's faithful, one hundred percent" [\[Seuss\]](https://artsresearch.uwaterloo.ca/chiastic/display/sources.php#RefWorks:113)).

Figures are social animals, though, and often travel in packs. [Mesodiplosis](https://artsresearch.uwaterloo.ca/chiastic/display/figure_simple.php?q=mesodiplosis), for instance, is a figure of medial repetition with frequently accompanies chiastic figures ("I meant what I said and I said what I meant").

[Parison](https://artsresearch.uwaterloo.ca/chiastic/display/figure_simple.php?q=parison), a figure of syntactic repetition, is also a regular travelling companion ("I meant what I said" and "I said what I meant" have exactly the same Pronoun — Verb — Complement — Pronoun — Verb structure).

Meanwhile, [Isocolon](https://artsresearch.uwaterloo.ca/chiastic/display/figure_simple.php?q=isocolon) is a figure of prosodic repetition, and it often accompanies Parison ("I meant what I said" and "I said what I meant" have the same intonation patterns).

And then there are figures that are less predictable. They just show up for some additional effect, like [rhyme](https://artsresearch.uwaterloo.ca/chiastic/display/figure_simple.php?q=rhyme), a figure of final syllable repetition ("I meant what I said and I said what I meant—an elephant's faithful, one hundred percent"). So, there are a lot of figures in here.
