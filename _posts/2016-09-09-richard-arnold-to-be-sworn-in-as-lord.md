_Lord Justice Arnold_

A few months ago, The IPKat proudly [**reported**](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2019/07/mr-justice-arnold-to-become-lord.html) that Katfriend [**Sir Richard Arnold**](https://www.judiciary.uk/publications/mr-justice-arnold/) had been elevated to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, and that he would thus become Lord Justice Arnold.

  

This announcement [**was published**](https://www.judiciary.uk/announcements/appointment-of-lord-and-lady-justices-of-appeal-july-2019/) on judiciary.uk:

> The Queen has been pleased to approve the appointment of Mrs Justice Carr as a Lady Justice of Appeal and the following as Lord Justices of Appeal: Mr Justice Arnold, Mr Justice Dingemans, Mr Justice Phillips and Mr Justice Popplewell.  
> These appointments will fill forthcoming vacancies in the Court of Appeal arising from autumn 2019.

The IPKat has now learnt that Sir Richard will be sworn in as a Lord Justice of Appeal on **Thursday, 17 October at 13:30 in Court 4 of the Royal Courts of Justice**.Â 

  

It is a public event, and everyone is welcome to attend. So: go if you can!

  

The IPKat team, including Merpel, wishes to congratulate Sir Richard once again on this very well-deserved appointment and looks forward to commenting on his future judgments as Lord Justice of Appeal!
