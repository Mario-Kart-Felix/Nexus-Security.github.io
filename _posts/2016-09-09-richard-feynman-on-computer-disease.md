A quote from Feynman’s book “Surely You’re Joking Mr. Feynman!” about how programmers get distracted (“play”) while working on their computers. Thanks to [dglenn](http://dglenn.deadjournal.com/1327277.html) for posting the quote.

> _“Well, Mr. Frankel, who started this program, began to suffer from the computer disease that anybody who works with computers now knows about._
> 
> _It’s a very serious disease and it interferes completely with the work. The trouble with computers is you **play** with them. They are so wonderful. You have these switches — if it’s an even number you do this, if it’s an odd number you do that — and pretty soon you can do more and more elaborate things if you are clever enough, on one machine._
> 
> _“After a while the whole system broke down. Frankel wasn’t paying any attention; he wasn’t supervising anybody. The system was going very, very slowly — while he was sitting in a room figuring out how to make one tabulator automatically print arc-tangent X, and then it would start and it would print columns and then bitsi, bitsi, bitsi, and calculate the arc-tangent automatically by integrating as it went along and make a whole table in one operation._
> 
> _“Absolutely useless. We **had** tables of arc-tangents. But if you’ve ever worked with computers, you understand the disease — the **delight** in being able to see how much you can do. But he got the disease for the first time, the poor fellow who invented the thing.”_
