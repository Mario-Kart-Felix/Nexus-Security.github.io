On the [Hackaday.io page for his gorgeous “Sunrise Alarm Clock”](https://hackaday.io/project/168165-sunrise-alarm-clock), \[The Big One\] is quick to point out that his design is only inspired by Japanese lanterns, and does not use authentic materials or traditional woodworking techniques. Perhaps that’s an important fact to some, but we’ll just say that the materials used seem far less important when the end result looks this good.

But he has provided a concise parts list, a wiring diagram, and source code, so we’ve got a pretty good idea of what’s under the hood.

The clock is powered by [the uBBB 32u4](https://hackaday.io/project/3330-ubbb-32u4), an ATMega32u4 development board that \[The Big One\] developed in conjunction with \[Warren Janssens\]. It uses the popular MAX7219 LED matrix for the display, and a DS3231 RTC module to help keep the time. There’s also a DFPlayer Mini module onboard that allows him to play whatever sound effects or music he wants when the alarm goes off.

Of course the star of the show is the LED strips which illuminate the shōji-style column. These have apparently been wrapped around a coffee can of all things, which not only serves as a convenient way of holding the strips, but \[The Big One\] says actually makes the speaker sound a bit better. Hey, whatever works.

This isn’t the first “lantern” clock to grace these pages, but compared to the [high-tech presentation of previous projects](https://hackaday.com/2013/12/06/dcf77-powered-clock-is-a-work-of-art/), we can’t help but be impressed by the grace and elegance of this wooden masterpiece.
