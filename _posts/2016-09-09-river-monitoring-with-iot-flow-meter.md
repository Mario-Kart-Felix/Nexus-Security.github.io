> This project demonstrates how to build an internet connected flow meter that continuously measures a river’s flow rate and makes real-time data available to users online.
> 
> The system can be deployed to remote rivers with a one-time setup, and can be left to run on its own, automatically collecting data without the need for users to be present. Multiple meters can be placed throughout a river to collect many points of data.
