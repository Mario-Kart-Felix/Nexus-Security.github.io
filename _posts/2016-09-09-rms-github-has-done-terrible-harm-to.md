\[\[\[ To any NSA and FBI agents reading my email: please consider \]\]\] \[\[\[ whether defending the US Constitution against all enemies, \]\]\] \[\[\[ foreign or domestic, requires you to follow Snowden's example. \]\]\] GitHub's encouragement of sloppy licensing, no licensing, or licensing under only a single version of the GPL, has done terrible harm to our community. GitHub was so bad for free software, all along, that I could imagine Microsoft's making it less bad, or making it more bad. We should judge by what actually happens, not by prejudice. Keep in mind that Apple is much worse than Microsoft. -- Dr Richard Stallman Founder, Free Software Foundation ([https://gnu.org](https://gnu.org), [https://fsf.org](https://fsf.org)) Internet Hall-of-Famer ([https://internethalloffame.org](https://internethalloffame.org))
