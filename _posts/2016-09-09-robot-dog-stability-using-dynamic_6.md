> I’ve been experimenting with simulated springs using back-driveable gearboxes with ODrive Brushless motor drivers to hold their positions, and of course current increases to hold the motor in position as they are ‘sprung’ away from their position. This allows dynamic control of the virtual spring tension.
> 
> I also implemented a controller to partially drive the motor to a new position if the leg is forced away from it’s target. This controller allow dynamic control over the compliance of the virtual spring.
