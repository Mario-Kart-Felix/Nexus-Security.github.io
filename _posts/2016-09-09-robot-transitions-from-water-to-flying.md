Via [Hackster.io](https://blog.hackster.io/flying-fish-robot-transitions-from-water-to-air-on-a-jet-of-water-e5240943e350), researchers at the Imperial College of London have created an aquatic robot which can mimic a “flying fish” by launching out using a jet of water. Water from the environment is the propellant with a small amount of calcium carbide.

> The fish-bot is controlled by an [Adafruit Feather M0 board, along with a Bluetooth interface](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2995), pressure sensor, and inertial measurement unit. Impressively, it has only one moving part — a pump that pulls in water from the environment. Multiple launches can be accomplished after sucking in more water to use as a propellant.

The [video](https://youtu.be/aJU8EL61NgA) above shows the robot in action. Additional details [can be found in the researcher’s paper](https://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/4/34/eaax7330).
