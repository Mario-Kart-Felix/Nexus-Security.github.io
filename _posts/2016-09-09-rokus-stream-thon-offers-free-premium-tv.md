Roku has announced its second annual Stream-a-thon. The Roku Channel Stream-a-thon offers premium TV shows for free, and it takes place for one week over the holidays. And all you need is access to The Roku Channel, either on a Roku device or on the web.

The Roku Channel is Roku’s official channel packed full of free and premium content. There are thousands of free movies, live and linear channels, plus [Premium Subscriptions](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/roku-channel-premium-subscriptions/) for channels such as HBO and Cinemax. The free content requires you to watch ads.

The Roku Channel Hosts the 2019 Stream-a-thon
---------------------------------------------

In 2018, The Roku Channel hosted Roku’s first Stream-a-thon, and it’s back for 2019. As outlined in a post on [the Roku Blog](https://blog.roku.com/en-gb/streamathon-announcement), Roku’s 2019 Stream-a-thon will give Roku users a chance to watch premium television content for free for one week only.

The 2019 Stream-a-thon will take place between December 26 and January 1st. And it will provide “full seasons of premium hit shows \[…\] full length features \[…\] epic documentaries, \[…\] and more.” All with “no trials, subscriptions, or commitments needed”.

During the Stream-a-thon you’ll be able to watch the first seasons of Game of Thrones, Warrior, Power, and Billions (amongst others). There will also be individual episodes of Chernobyl, Succession, Pennyworth, Kidding, and many more besides.

Roku’s Rob Holmes said, “There’s no better way to welcome new Roku users and enable both novice and veteran streamers alike to decompress from the holidays with some of TV’s most popular shows available for free on The Roku Channel.”

The Best Free Roku Channels Worth Watching
------------------------------------------

While this is a noble effort, it isn’t exactly charitable. Roku and its premium partners are giving away content for free in the hopes of getting you hooked. However, there’s nothing stopping you from taking advantage of the free content without subscribing.

As good as Roku’s Stream-a-thon is, unfortunately, it only lasts a week. So, after you’re done streaming the first seasons of Game of Thrones, Warrior, Power, and Billions, why not check out [the best free Roku channels not to miss](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-free-roku-channels/).
