Russian company Engineering Technologies has developed a Poseidon system to protect ships and ports from cyberattacks. Domestic and foreign customers are already interested in this development.  
  
Currently, 90% of the world's cargo is transported by sea. Objects of marine infrastructure due to their high automation and computerization are often victim of hackers. So, in 2017 and 2018, cyber attacks were carried out on the largest sea carriers Maersk (Denmark) and COSCO (China), as a result of which cargo terminal systems were blocked. In Russia in early 2018, hackers tried to disrupt the work of the Administration of the Sea Ports of Azov Sea.  
  
"The Poseidon complex is being developed to protect ships and marine infrastructure facilities – ports, shipyards, drilling platforms from cyberattacks," said Artem Dolgikh, Poseidon Project Manager and Technical Director of Engineering Technologies.  
  
Currently, most ships are protected using standard software, as well as security rules and policies on network equipment.  
  
Poseidon uses the author's database of cyber vulnerability scenarios for the marine area and an automated threat detection algorithm implemented on the basis of neural networks and artificial intelligence.  
  
According to Artem Dolgikh, the application of the program will reduce the costs of shipowners. So, a number of industry-specific marine companies, both in Russia and abroad, are already interested in it.  
  
It became known that the software part of the system is planned to be developed in Russia, and the hardware part can be produced both on the territory of the Russian Federation and abroad.  
  
Earlier, [E Hacking News reported](https://www.ehackingnews.com/2018/04/shipping-industry-to-go-digital.html) that now shipping companies are considering moving into the digital era and to work out a system which will integrate blockchain technology into one vast platform. A number of different shipping lines, such as A.P. Moeller- Maersk A/S have teamed up with technology companies, and they are about to revolutionize the shipping industry and upgrade the world’s most complex logistics network.
