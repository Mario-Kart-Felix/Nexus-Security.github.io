Russian hackers who are members of the well-known on the Internet 2ch imageboard hacked the website of NATO Rapid Deployable Corps Italy. This is one of NATOâ€™s most combat-ready formations on the European continent.  
  
Unlike Russian military units and formations, NATO formations have direct access to the Internet and even their own websites linked to each other via the Internet. Russian school hackers from the 2ch portal took advantage of this loophole to guide the Italian Corps website.  
  
Hackers renamed the name of the corps, it began to be named NATO Rapid Deployable Corps 2ch.  
  
Then they added the name of their organization 2ch to the number of special forces that are part of the corps. And finally, the name and biography of the corps commander, Lieutenant General Roberto Perretti, were replaced with the data of the administrator of 2ch portal Nariman Namazov, better known under the nickname Abu. Thus, the Russian hacker commanded the Italian NATO corps for some time.  
In addition, hackers added a video "Appeal to Obama" in the section with videos, where a drunk Russian man threatens the ex-President of the United States, and a modified anthem of Russia was set as background music.  
  
It is hard to say how far the hackers got into the system and what were the true goals of the hacking arranged as petty hooliganism.  
  
Note that NATO Rapid Deployable Corps Italy, whose website was hacked, is one of the nine rapid deployment corps. They include the most high-tech units of the member countries of the Alliance, including special forces units. One of these units is the Italian corps. It includes a number of Italian special forces, including the one known as Vittorio Veneto, the best special unit of the Italian Bersaglieri. In addition to the Italian parts of the corps subordinated Hungarian, Slovenian, Greek and one of the British special forces units.  
  
The task of the Italian corps is to control southern Europe and North Africa, as well as the organization of special operations in these territories.
