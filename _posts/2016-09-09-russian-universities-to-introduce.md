The office of the Russian Ombudsman Tatyana Moskalkova proposed to create in Russian universities special course on artificial intelligence.Â  The aim of the course is training to counter the threats of artificial intelligence within the discipline of human rights protection.  
  
Moreover, it is expected that the novelty will become part of the training program not only for law students, where the protection of human rights is one of the main disciplines. This special course is also necessary for future technical specialists.  
  
The press service of Moskalkova's office clarified that " the course will be constantly adjusted, filled with new things in accordance with technological development." An interesting fact is that there is an express course on the philosophy of artificial intelligence at Moscow State University.  
  
It should be noted that during the BRICS summit on November 14, Kirill Dmitriev, the head of The Russian Direct Investment Fund, a member of THE BRICS business Council, said that an Alliance for the development of artificial intelligence can be created within the BRICS.  
  
In addition, according to Alexander Bernstein, the head of the neurosurgical Department of the Burdenko Center, artificial intelligence from 2021 will help in the planning of complex neurosurgical operations. Now artificial intelligence is already used in the medical center to remove intracerebral tumors. In the future, the scope is planned to expand.  
  
Recall that on October 10, 2019, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the development of artificial intelligence in Russia. This decree approves the national strategy for the development of artificial intelligence until 2030. The President also spoke about the need for maximum support for startups in the field of artificial intelligence and several times to increase the volume and quality of training for programmers, mathematicians, computer linguists and data processing specialists.
