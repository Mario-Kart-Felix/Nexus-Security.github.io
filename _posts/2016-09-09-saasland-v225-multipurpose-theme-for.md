In Russia, the number of DDoS attacks will increase due to the introduction of 5G technology, said Anton Fishman, head of the system solutions Department of the Group-IB.  
  
He noted that the wider introduction of 5G will significantly increase the number of traditional attacks that providers have faced in recent years. "For example, the power and frequency of DDoS attacks will increase significantly due to many insecure devices."  
  
According to him, a DDoS attack can be used as a distraction when stealing money from a Bank or disabling a service.  
  
Earlier, Stanislav Kuznetsov, Deputy Chairman of the Board of Sberbank, said that the main areas that require attention when countering cybercrime are DDoS attacks, data leaks and fraud using social engineering methods. He explained that the number of DDoS attacks has increased, their quality has changed, in addition, it is quite difficult to detect them.  
  
It is important to add that on the eve of the Deputy Chairman of the Board of Sberbank Stanislav Kuznetsov said that in January the bank underwent the most powerful DDoS attack in its history.  
  
"On January 2, 2020, Sberbank faced an unprecedented DDoS attack that was 30 times more powerful than the most powerful attack in the history of Sberbank. The attack was carried out using IoT devices (Internet of Things)," said Kuznetsov, noting that the state Bank successfully repelled the cyberattack.  
  
According to Kuznetsov, not every company in Russia or even in the world could reflect such attacks.  
"This could become a trend in 2020 \[increasing cyber attacks\]," he added.  
  
According to Kuznetsov, in 2019, the number of hacker attacks on Sberbank increased by 15-20%, and the Bank records 280-300 attempts to attack its systems per day.  
  
"We identify all of them and block them. In addition, it is worth noting that mass malicious mailings are still popular — about 50% of the emails that our employees receive are spam, including phishing attempts," said the Deputy Chairman of Sberbank.
