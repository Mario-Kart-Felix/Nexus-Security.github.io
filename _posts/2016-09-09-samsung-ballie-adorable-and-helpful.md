Does the idea of an adorable little ball following you around sound like something appealing? Samsung sure hopes, so as the company has unveiled Ballie as part of its Intelligent Robots program. Everyone loves BB-8, and Samsung’s helpful little robot might be as close as we’ll ever get to living with an actual version of the Star Wars robot in our lives.

At its core, Ballie is a round device with a camera attached to it that follows its owners around. Samsung seems to think that it will be particularly useful as a companion for pets when humans are out enjoying their day-to-day lives, but it also promises much more in terms of capability.

In some ways, Ballie is like a Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa speaker that is able to follow you around your home, taking commands whenever you need it to. An example Samsung used during the presentation was Ballie detecting a mess your dog made and then calling the robot vacuum over to pick it up. It’s basically a narc with a camera designed to keep your home in check.

As cool as Ballie looks (and trust us, it’s really cool), Samsung hasn’t announced anything in terms of price or release date for its adorable little robot. In fact, the company didn’t even announce whether we’d actually see Ballie come to market ever. Hopefully, we do because I can most definitely see Ballie rolling around my house, keeping myself and my pups entertained for hours on end.

Unfortunately, while Samsung offered a lot of hypotheticals about how we could use Ballie (as mentioned above), it wasn’t able to demonstrate all of these due to the limitations of being on the CES show floor on a small demo stage. Still, it all looks rather promising, and we’re definitely intrigued to see how Ballie could be integrated into an existing smart home setup (or if it would be useful enough just as a way to keep an eye on your dogs while keeping them entertained).
