After [launching the Galaxy Fold in South Korea](https://beebom.com/galaxy-fold-launch-date-september-6/) and the US last month, Samsung has finally launched it in India, [as planned](https://beebom.com/galaxy-fold-india-launch-date-price/). The device was originally unveiled back in February and, was set to be launched globally by the end of April before [reports of serious malfunction](https://beebom.com/galaxy-fold-review-units-breaking/) forced Samsung to [postpone its global availability](https://beebom.com/samsung-galaxy-fold-delayed/). However, now that the supposedly-fixed device is being launched commercially, a new report last week suggested that the upgraded display [may still have some issues](https://beebom.com/revamped-galaxy-fold-display-defect/) that might not have been rectified entirely.  

Samsung Galaxy Fold Specifications and Features

The Galaxy Fold comes with a 7.3 inch QXGA+ Dynamic AMOLED display with a resolution of 2152 x 1536 pixels and HDR10+ support. It also has a 4.6-inch Super AMOLED cover display with a 21:9 aspect ratio and a 1680 x 720 pixel resolution. The device is powered by the Snapdragon 855, and is offered with 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The phone comes with a side-mounted physical fingerprint scanner, while other sensors include an accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass and barometer.  

The triple-cam setup at the back includes a 12 MP primary sensor paired to an f/1.5-2.4, 27mm wide-angle lens with Dual Pixel PDAF and OIS. There’s also a 12MP secondary sensor paired to an f/2.4, 52mm telephoto lens with OIS and 2x optical zoom. The final sensor, a 16MP unit, comes with an f/2.2, 12mm ultrawide lens.

The Galaxy Fold runs Android 9 Pie out-of-the-box, but one would expect the Android 10 update to be rolled out sooner rather than later.
