At the Samsung Developer Conference 2019 (SDC19) the company teased a new clam shell folding-screen form factor that it's working on. This folds vertically to form a small and square form factor when closed. It also shows a punch-hole camera. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZDl\_SP-w9E In the video, it has shown side-by-side comparison between the curent Galaxy Fold and the upcoming Clamshell model to show how the UI will resize elements if the clamshell device is partially folded.  The new model is said to be codenamed 'Bloom' with the model number SM-F700F, and feature a 6.7-inch foldable display and a 1-inch cover display. The Galaxy Fold 2 is expected to be cheaper than the first-gen, and could be introduced at the MWC 2020 or a separate Galaxy Unpacked event in Q1 2020. We still don't have any other details of the phone yet. Samsung could use the latest Exynos 990 SoC with 5G Exynos Modem 5123 when the phone arrives next year.
