![](https://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-10-Lite-leak.jpg) Details about the Samsung Galaxy Note10 Lite surfaced couple of months back, and the render of the phone surfaced earlier this month showing off the phone's punch-hole screen. Now more renders of the phone have surfaced showing off the phone's design in full glory. This shows a punch-hole AMOLED screen, but this is more flat like the S10e compared to the curved edges on the other S10 and Note10 series. It also shows square camera setup similar to the latest Galaxy A51 and A71 phones, and it is said to be adopted in the S11 series next year. It could feature 3D Glasstic finish with a metal frame and rounded back with gradient finish. The images show Black, Red, and Aura Glow colors. It will come with S Pen, similar to other Note series phones, but the new stylus could have Bluetooth 5.1 with location tracking capabilities. It should run Android 10 and OneUI 2.0 out of the box. The phone is said to launch in Europe in the coming weeks and is rumored to be priced around €650 (US$ 723 / Rs. 51,420 approx.). We should know more details in the coming weeks. Source
