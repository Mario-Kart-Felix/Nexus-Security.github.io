![](https://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S20-Plus-5G-leak-1024x681.jpg) Samsung is all set to introduce its Galaxy S20 at its Galaxy Unpacked event next month. We had already seen several renders of the phone, now the first set of live images of the phone have surfaced. This shows the phone's Infinity-O AMOLED screen, name of the phone on the boot screen and quad rear cameras arranged in a rectangular part which protrudes out of the phone's glass part. This doesn't show dedicated Bixby button on the side. It is said to pack a 12MP 1.8μm main sensor along with an ultra-wide, telephoto, and probably a macro lens. The microphone on the back is said to support Samsung's zoom-in mic feature similar to the Galaxy Note10. This is said to feature a 2.5D glass instead of curved glass in their earlier phones. Samsung is said to introduce both 4G and 5G versions of the Galaxy S20 and S20+, but the 5G variants with Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Mobile Platform and Snapdragon X55 5G modem is said to roll out only in limited markets, while the other markets could get Exynos 990 SoC, which also has 5G support with Exynos Modem 5123.
