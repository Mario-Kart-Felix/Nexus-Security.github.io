Samsung is expected to launch its clamshell-designed foldable phone – the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip next week at the [Galaxy Unpacked event](https://beebom.com/galaxy-s20-fold-2-launch-date-revealed/). We have already seen multiple leaks regarding the design and specifications of the handset and now, popular concept designer **Ben Geskin has shared a hands-on video of the Galaxy Z Flip**.  

Ben took to Twitter to share the video over the weekend. In the video, we see the Mirror Purple color variant of the alleged Galaxy Z Flip. Take a look at the tweet below.

The 19-second clip complies with the design renders we’ve seen in the past. We see the dual rear cameras along with the secondary tiny display first seen in the leaked [real-life images](https://beebom.com/first-look-samsung-galaxy-fold-2-leaked/) of the handset. The secondary display is expected to be a **1.06-inch Always-On Super AMOLED panel with 300 x 116 pixel resolution**. It is rumored to show the time and notifications.  

To recap, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip is expected to sport a huge 6.7-inch Full-HD+ AMOLED display with a 22:9 aspect ratio and punch-hole design. The punch-hole could house a 10MP selfie camera. It is rumored to be powered by the **Snapdragon 855 Plus** chipset. 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage are expected on the foldable phone.
