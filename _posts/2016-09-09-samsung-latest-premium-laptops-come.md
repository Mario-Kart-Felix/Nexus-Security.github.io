If one of the first things that come to your mind when thinking about Samsung are smartphones, I completely understand. We’re in the same boat, you and I. However, Samsung makes a lot of other stuff, and today, the company has announced two new premium laptops aimed at professionals and creatives, and they are absolutely packed with features.  

The Galaxy Book Flex and the Galaxy Book Ion are the latest premium laptops from Samsung, and they are loaded with features that professionals, and users who need high performance on-the-go will appreciate.  

Both these laptops come with Samsung’s absolutely awesome QLED displays, which means, in theory, these displays are more vivid, and brighter than most other laptops out there. They also have a dedicated Outdoor Mode which ramps up the brightness to a whopping 600 nits. Compare that to the MacBook Pro’s 354 nits brightness value, and you can sort of understand just how bright these screens can get.  

More interestingly, the **laptops come with touchpads that can wirelessly charge your smartphone as long as it supports Qi wireless charging.** That’s insane, and I don’t know when or why I might use this, but I wanna use this. If anyone from Samsung is reading this, please send me a review unit. I just wanna charge my phone while I type articles. Is that too much to ask?  

The specs on both the Galaxy Book Flex and Galaxy Book Ion are amazing as well. Here’s a spec-sheet for both 13 and 15-inch variants of both laptops.
