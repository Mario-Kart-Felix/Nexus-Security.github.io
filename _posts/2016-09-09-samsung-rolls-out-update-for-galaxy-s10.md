![](https://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Samsung-Galaxy-S10_fonearena-5-1024x731.jpg) Last week, it was discovered that Galaxy S10 series and the Note 10 series had a fatal security flaw where users who installed a silicon cover for the phone could unlock their phone using any fingerprint, registered or not. Samsung acknowledged the issue and said they will soon release the fix for it. Less than a week later, the fix has been rolled out to the affected devices through a software update. For those affected devices, users will receive an update notification titled “Biometrics update,” and they just have to tap on Update when it arrives. The affected devices include Galaxy Note 10, Note 10+, Galaxy S10, S10+ and S10 5G phones. Once the update is installed, users are advised to remove any existing silicon cover and re-register all their fingerprints without the cover. Samsung also said that users will only receive the notification for the update if they have any fingerprints registered in their device. Since the update cannot be swiped away from the notification, it can be said that this update will not be a full system OTA.
