Samsung introduced 12GB LPDDRX chips with 1y-nanometer process technology back in March that combines six 16-gigabit (Gb) LPDDR4X chips (16Gb=2GB) based on the second-generation 10nm-class (1y-nm) process into a single package. By combining four of the 24-gigabit (Gb) LPDDR4X chips (24Gb=3GB) based on the second-generation 10nm-class (1y-nm) process into a single package, the new mobile memory is able to break through the current 8GB package limit and provide 10+ GB memory to the broader smartphone market, said the company. 12GB LPDDR4X uMCP: four 24Gb (3GB) chips + eUFS 3.0 10GB LPDDR4X uMCP: two 24Gb (3GB) chips + two 16Gb (2GB) chips + eUFS 3.0 With 1.5X capacity of the previous 8GB package and a data transfer rate of 4,266 megabits per second (Mbps), the 12GB uMCP can support smooth 4K video recording as well as accommodate AI and machine learning features even for mid-end smartphones. Samsung said that it plans to rapidly expand the availability of 10+ GB LPDDR DRAM to address the increasing needs of global smartphone makers for higher-capacity ...
