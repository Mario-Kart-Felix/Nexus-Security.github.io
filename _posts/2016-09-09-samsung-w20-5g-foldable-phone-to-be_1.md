This is the successor of the W2019 that was introduced in November last year, but with a different design. All the Samsung's previous W series phones were flip phones with dual displays, one on the outside, and other one on the inside, but this looks like a foldable phone with a flip design, similar to the one showcased at the Samsung Developer Conference 2019 (SDC19) earlier this week. Earlier rumors said that the new model is said to be codenamed ‘Bloom’ with the model number SM-F700F, and is rumored to feature a 6.7-inch foldable display and a 1-inch cover display. Motorola already confirmed that new razr foldable phone will be introduced on November 13th, and the recent images revealed a foldable phone with a flip design that also has a screen on the outside.
