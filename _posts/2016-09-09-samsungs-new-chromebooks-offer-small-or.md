Samsung has expanded its well-regarded Chromebook series with to include two new [Google Assistant-equipped models](https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-chromebook-4-chromebook-4plus-faster-tougher-smarter/) that have been designed to resemble the style of more premium machines, despite being powered by a Celeron chip and Chrome OS.

Known as the Chromebook 4 and Chromebook 4+, the machines are meant to set the bar among competitors when it comes to portability, usability, and performance. The Chromebook 4 is on the small side with just an 11.6-inch, 1366 x 768 display, packing 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The Chromebook 4+ goes to the other end of the spectrum with a much larger 15.6-inch 1080p screen and the same RAM and storage. Both can be upgraded to 6GB RAM and 64GB of storage for $50 more.

The smaller screen on the 11.6-inch model goes a ways toward conserving battery life as well, as the Chromebook 4 is listed as having a run time of 12.5 hours versus 10.5 hours for the 4+, though 10.5 hours is still probably close enough to “all day” battery for most people that they can leave their charger at home. Of note, the 4+ has two USB-C ports instead of only one on the plain Chromebook 4.

Both models feature a “platinum titan” metal finish and are said to have undergone extensive durability testing. This testing includes having met eight military-grade standards as well as measuring extreme temperatures, dust, and shocks to make sure these systems are ready to be tossed around during your commute.
