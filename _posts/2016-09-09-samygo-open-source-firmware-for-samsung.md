**SamyGO is a project for legal reverse engineering and research on Samsung Television firmwares which is Open Sourced, partially.  
We try to fix problems that in the firmware. We don't want money from you. We make this modifications for us and ourself but you are allowed to join us.

( The recent set of Samsung TV Firmwares is based on Linux core (GPL), which our work will be building upon. Therefore all work done is in compliance with and subject to the GPL )  

Enable PVR for Cable TV or Dish Network
---------------------------------------

SamyGO enables PVR on some TV models so users could record their favorite programs.  
Notice: PVR requires use of internal digital tuner of TV. Dish recording available only for TVs that has DVB-S tuner inside.  
So Set top box setups not supported.  
Ask your Satelite Dish or Cable TV Provider if they allows use of internal tuner with Crypt cards.
