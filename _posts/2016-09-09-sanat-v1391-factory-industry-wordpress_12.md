When it comes to tracking [health and fitness](https://beebom.com/best-workout-apps/) data, Apple Health remains my top bet by a long distance. Apart from boasting a whole host of health-centric features like [hearing health](https://beebom.com/set-up-noise-app-measure-decibel-levels-apple-watch/) and [cycle-tracking](https://beebom.com/set-up-cycle-tracking-ios-13-watchos-6/), the app excels in measuring a variety of metrics accurately. But that doesn’t mean it never fails to get the Maths right. Many a time, I have seen the app unable to count walking and running distance with the desired accuracy. And when that happens, I feel like losing the challenge well before completing the goal. Fortunately, there is always a straightforward way to add data to a health category on the iPhone. If you belong to the same ballpark as me, let me show you how you can manually add data to health app on iPhone.
