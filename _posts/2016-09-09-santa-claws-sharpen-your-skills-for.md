Want to do a bit of good this holiday season without leaving your couch or battle station? Well step right up and try your hand at [Santa Claws](https://www.libertygames.co.uk/content/santa-claws/), the charitable claw machine created by UK-based firm Liberty Games. For every toy you can maneuver to the chute, Liberty Games will donate money to Crisis, a national charity devoted to ending homelessness.

The machine is filled with special Christmas-themed stuffed animals that represent different cash values from £1 to £5. And these toys are doing double duty — after the holiday, they’ll all be donated to a good cause. In order to make this playable worldwide, Liberty used a Raspberry Pi, two Pi Face boards to interface the claw machine’s controls, and a Pi Face rack to everything together. They have the machine set on ‘generous’, so go have fun.

Has this rekindled a longing for your own claw machine? Yeah, us too. [Here’s a full-size machine that runs on a Teensy](https://hackaday.com/2015/09/14/full-size-custom-claw-machine-built-with-parts-on-hand/).
