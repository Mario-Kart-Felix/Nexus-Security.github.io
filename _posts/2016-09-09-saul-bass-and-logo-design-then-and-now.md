_Fifteen years after Bass’ death, a book about his work finally hit the shelves: [Saul Bass: A Life in Film & Design](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1856697525/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=themovietitle-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=1856697525 "Saul Bass: A Life in Film & Design")._  
  

> “If I do my job well, the identity program will also clean up the image of the company, position it as being contemporary and keep it from ever looking dated”. — Saul Bass

Bass certainly did his job well, he created some of the most recognizable and iconic logos of all time, but they’re gradually disappearing. The most recent death of a Saul Bass logo has been the famous United ‘tulip,’ which was used by the company for 37 years until the merger with Continental in 2010. This caused quite a controversy in the design world, because 1) you don’t mess with a Saul Bass logo 2) you don’t replace a Saul Bass logo with a generic clipart-like version that’s much worse than the original.  
  
I thought it would be interesting to find out what happened to Bass’ other logo/symbol designs and was surprised to see how many of them are still alive.  
  
Some facts and figures about the logos: 21 years after Bass’ death 13 of the 23 logos displayed above still remain the same (this also includes refreshed logos), 6 logos ‘died’ when companies went bankrupt or merged with others. Only 4 logos were replaced by completely redesigned versions. Most significant proof of a job well done is the longevity of Bass’ logos. The average lifespan of the 23 logos on this page is 34 years.  
Let me repeat that:  
**The average lifespan of a Saul Bass logo is 34 years.**  
  
EDIT: “YT” in the comments points out that the Bell logo was used until 2009, which makes the average lifespan of a Saul Bass logo even more impressive: 35.0869565 years.  
  
EDIT 2: Josh Kasten kindly provided some additional information: 1) The Celanese re-design was executed by Siegel+Gale 2) Both versions of the Geffen logo were designed by Bass/Yager & Associates. 3) The Alcoa revitalization was done by Arnold Saks Associates in 1998.
