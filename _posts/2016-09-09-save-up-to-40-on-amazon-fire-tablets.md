If you’ve been waiting for a heavy discount on Amazon’s devices, now might be the time to get your wallet out. The company has reduced prices by as much as $40 on many of its Fire tablets and Kindle e-readers.

In some cases, this pricing has previously only been offered during sales events that were limited to Amazon Prime subscribers. However, this promotion is available to everyone. The discounted items include the standard Fire 7 and Fire 8, Kids Edition Fire 7 and Fire 8, as well as the new 10th-gen Kindle and [Kindle Paperwhite](https://www.reviewgeek.com/8661/the-new-kindle-paperwhite-is-waterproof-still-affordable/).

Although the Fire 7’s price has only been reduced by $10, that puts the device at [$39.99](https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Tablet-7/dp/B07FKR6KXF/?tag=reviewgeekdeals-20) as it was previously only $49.99. If you’d prefer a bigger display and beefier battery, the Fire 8 has been discounted to [$59.99](https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Fire-Tablet-Display-Black/dp/B0794RHPZD/?tag=reviewgeekdeals-20) from $79.99.

Likewise, the Fire 7 Kids Edition is now priced at [$](https://www.amazon.com/Fire-7-Kids-Edition-Tablet/dp/B07H8WS1FT/?tag=reviewgeekdeals-20)[69.99](https://www.amazon.com/Fire-7-Kids-Edition-Tablet/dp/B07H8WS1FT/?tag=reviewgeekdeals-20) and the Fire 8 Kids Edition is [$](https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Fire-Tablet-Display-Kid-Proof/dp/B07952WB66/?tag=reviewgeekdeals-20)[99.99](https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Fire-Tablet-Display-Kid-Proof/dp/B07952WB66/?tag=reviewgeekdeals-20)—both being $30 off their usual rate. Amazon’s “[Kids Edition](https://www.reviewgeek.com/24738/amazon-announces-new-kids-edition-kindle-e-reader-fire-hd-10-tablet/?tag=reviewgeekdeals-20)” products come with a protective cover, one year of access to kid-friendly content through [FreeTime Unlimited](https://www.amazon.com/ftu/home?tag=reviewgeekdeals-20), and a two-year worry-free guarantee that Amazon will replace any devices your kids break.

Amazon’s 10th-generation Kindle (the newest one) has seen its price cut by $25 from $89.99 to [$64.99](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DLPWYB7?tag=reviewgeekdeals-20). Key features include an integrated front light for reading in the dark and weeks-long battery life. Alternatively, the Kindle Paperwhite with its ultra-sharp 300 ppi display is now only [$](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Waterproof-Storage-Special/dp/B07PS737QQ/?tag=reviewgeekdeals-20)[89.99](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Waterproof-Storage-Special/dp/B07PS737QQ/?tag=reviewgeekdeals-20), $40 off from $129.99.

It’s not just Amazon US who has these types of deals going on right now. Amazon UK currently offers similar discounts on the Fire 7 (£15 off, [now only £35](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07JQRYR5M?tag=reviewgeekdeals-20)), Fire 8 (£20 off, [now only £60](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0794ZL74C?tag=reviewgeekdeals-20)), and the Kindle Paperwhite (£30 off, [now](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07747FR44?tag=reviewgeekdeals-20) [only £90](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07747FR44?tag=reviewgeekdeals-20)).
