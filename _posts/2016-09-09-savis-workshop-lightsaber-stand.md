> Lightsaber Hilt Stand  
> This stand has been specifically designed for the lightsabers built in Savi’s Workshop at Galaxy’s Edge in Disney. It incorporates the workshop logo as the tall stand to hold the emiter end of your saber and there are many varients so you can display the logo of the type of saber that you built (Protection and Defense, Power and Control, etc…)
> 
> You can use this with other hilts it’s just designed specifically for their size and weight. In addition to being a hilt stand it is also a display case for your kyber crystals. The crystals can be placed in on the plastic stand they come with.
> 
> Kyber Crystal Holder  
> In addition to being a hilt stand for your custom saber you can also display your collection of Kyber crystals in this stand. The crystals can be placed inside the cut out holes and stood up using their small plastic pieces that they come with. The kyber crystal holders were specifically designed to allow you to install your own LEDs under the crystal creating a lighting effect. Once you wire up the LEDs you can print the Wire Cover and close it all up giving you a fitting display for your scrap metal.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!

The [Adafruit Learning System](http://learn.adafruit.com) has dozens of great tools to get you well on your way to creating incredible works of engineering, interactive art, and design with your 3D printer! If you’ve made a cool project that combines 3D printing and electronics, be sure to let us know, and we’ll [feature](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) it here!
