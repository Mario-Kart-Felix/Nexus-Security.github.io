SBCL's 20th Anniversary Workshop
================================

[SBCL](http://www.sbcl.org/ "Steel Bank Common Lisp") was [announced](http://www.sbcl.org/sbcl20/sbcl-0.0) to the world in December 1999. To celebrate, there will be a workshop in Vienna at [_Bundesrechenzentrum_](https://www.brz.gv.at/), the Federal Computing Center of Austria on Monday 9th and Tuesday 10th December 2019. (There was a [10th anniversary workshop](http://www.sbcl.org/sbcl10/) in London in 2009)

General information
-------------------

Programme
---------

The SBCL20 workshop is intended to give a space and time so that interested parties can discuss ideas, hear other peoples' use cases and desires, and work on blue-sky design in collaboration. There will be a few more extended talks to serve as motivation, but most of the workshop will be held in rooms with numerous flipcharts, network connections, and access to caffeinated beverages. Towards the end of each day, all participants will be invited to give lightning talks on anything that they have worked on during that time, or any other topic of interest.

### Speakers

Robert Smith: SBCL, 64-bit PowerPC and Quantum Computing

Rigetti Computing develops quantum integrated circuits and quantum computers, and provides a compiler and virtual machine allowing users to experiment with quantum algorithms. I'll talk about using SBCL to build quantum computing tools, why I have been a long advocate of a port to the 64-bit POWER architecture, and offer thoughts on how Common Lisp can stay alive in the quantum computing future.
