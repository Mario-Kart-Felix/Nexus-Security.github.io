> Scientists in France have cracked the most complex cryptography algorithm attempted to date. The algorithm they solved is still much, much weaker than the practical cryptography used in real security, but to solve even this smaller algorithm is a big accomplishment in computing. The scientists used a bunch of computers working simultaneously around the world to turn 35 million computing hours into a doable timeframe.
