Chemists from Far Eastern Federal University's School of Natural Sciences (SNS FEFU) have developed a new method to synthesize biologically active derivatives of fascaplysin—the cytotoxic pigment of a sea sponge. For the first time, they obtained a sufficient amount of 3-bromofascaplysin and 3,10-dibromofascaplysin, which were known before but were not available for study. Based on these compounds, scientists synthesized 14-bromoreticulatate and 14-bromoreticulatine—derivatives of reticulatine alkaloids. The resulting article is published in Marine Drugs.
