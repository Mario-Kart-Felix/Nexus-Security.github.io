> A large network of undersea telecommunications cables crisscrosses the planet under the water and on land. The cables carry data all around the world, and many of them are owned by Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. A team of researchers from UC Berkeley, Berkeley Lab, the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and Rice University has described an experiment that turned 20km of undersea fiber-optic cable into the equivalent of 10,000 seismic stations.
