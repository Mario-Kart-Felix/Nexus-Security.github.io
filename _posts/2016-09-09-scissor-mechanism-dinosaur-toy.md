> All parts can be printed with no supports, just be sure that they lay flat. Dino skull should be printed with nose facing up on its flat part on back of the skull.  
> There are pretty tight tolerances, so if You are not sure of Your printer quality – print 1 pin and 1 inner arm first and try how they fit. Pins should slide in the holes with slight resistance.  
> As some parts are small, i recommend to print them at lower speeds.  
> Start assembling form skull, through scissor mechanism, to pistol area.  
> Numbers before the part names means how many of this part is needed. Of course You can make scissors mechanism longer or shorter as You wish.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
