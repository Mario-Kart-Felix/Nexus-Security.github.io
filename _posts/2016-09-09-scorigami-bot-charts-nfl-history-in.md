NFL Football is a curious game to those who live beyond the borders of the continental United States. Its rules are many and complex, and its scoring system is built on arcane magic. This system means that there are many _possible_ final game scores that have never actually happened in practice. For fans keen to hear of any first-time scores as they happen, [Scorigami bot](https://twitter.com/nfl_scorigami?lang=en) is here to help.

[Charting and researching these is the practice of Scorigami](https://nflscorigami.com/), an idea first posited by Jon Bois, [and is explored in this SB Nation video.](https://youtu.be/9l5C8cGMueY) It covers the many _impossible_ scores in NFL, such as 1-0 and 1-1, as well as the _possible-but-extremely-unlikely_, like 6-1. To keep track of the state of Scorigami means following every score of every NFL game as its played. The ‘bot makes this easier; scraping the NFL livescores page with some nifty Javascript, it tracks each game live for potential first-time scores; the most recent as of writing being the Chiefs beating the Texans 51-31. Not only that, but the ‘bot estimates the most likely possible scorigami scores of games in progress, keeping fans on tenterhooks until the final whistle is blown. Or is it a siren in NFL? Inquiring minds need to know.

Code is naturally [available on Github](https://github.com/ACMerriman/scorigami) if you want to independently audit the Twitter feed; obviously the sanctity of scorigami results is absolutely paramount, and ensuring as such is a community responsibility. We’ve seen other live-score projects before, [like this glowing Super Bowl football.](https://hackaday.com/2015/02/04/super-bowl-football-lamp-keeps-you-informed/)
