> The first scrambler phones were invented prior to the Second World War to secure voice transmission for commercial use.  You can think of a scrambler as an encryption device for analogue signals – an analogue signal is a continuously varying, smooth signal, whilst a digital signal has discrete values.
> 
> Standard digital encryption works by applying mathematical functions to the digital data to produce codes.  Scrambling works by taking an analogue waveform and modifying the frequencies in a way that makes it incomprehensible. The wave is then unscrambled, a process that transforms the wave back to its original form.
