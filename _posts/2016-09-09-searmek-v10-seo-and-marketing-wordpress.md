Microsoft has announced plans to launch exclusive Xbox-only games every few months. In an [interview to GamesRadar](https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/xbox-game-studios-matt-booty-interview-project-scarlett/), the head of Xbox Game Studios, Matt Booty, said that the company believes it would be able to churn out new, first-party games every 3-4 months without compromising on quality. _“We feel really good heading into 2020. We’ve got a goal of being able to deliver a game, roughly, every three to four months”_, he said.  

He, however, rejected any notion that there’s been a shift in the company’s policy in looking beyond third-party games to focus on in-house titles. _“I don’t think there’s been a shift … Sarah Bond, who leads our third-party team, is out there day in and day out working with our third-party partners … I think you would hear an equal amount of talk about first-party, third-party, and [\[email protected\]](http://beebom.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) It’s just that, lately, we felt a little more proud about talking about what we’ve got going on with first-party”_, he said.  

Sadly, though, Booty didn’t reveal anything new about the next-gen Xbox console – ‘[Project Scarlett](https://beebom.com/xbox-project-scarlett-unveiled-e3-2019/)‘ – that’s been confirmed to launched next year. He did, however, claimed that the device will have the largest launch line-up of any Xbox system because any game that runs on an Xbox One will run on Scarlett. _“You’re not porting to a different operating system; you’re not porting to a different graphics API; you’re just running an Xbox game, right? So we hope that that’s a big advantage in terms of our initial content library”_, he said.  

He also tried to reassure Xbox One users that their current-gen Xbox console won’t be consigned to the bins of obscurity with the release of the new device next year, saying: _“We want people to feel comfortable investing in Xbox (irrespective of whether) you’re going to go buy an Xbox One S or next fall you’re going to go buy a Scarlett. (The) content library that you invest in is going to go forward (with you\], so that you don’t have to feel like you’re making a choice between generations”_.
