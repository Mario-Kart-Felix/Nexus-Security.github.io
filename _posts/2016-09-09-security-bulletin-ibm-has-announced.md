IBM has announced a release for IBM Security Identity Governance and Intelligence (IGI) in response to security vulnerability. The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. A memory leak was discovered in the backport of fixes for CVE-2018-16864 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Function dispatch\_message\_real() in journald-server.c does not free the memory allocated by set\_iovec\_field\_free() to store the \`\_CMDLINE=\` entry. A local attacker may use this flaw to make systemd-journald crash.
