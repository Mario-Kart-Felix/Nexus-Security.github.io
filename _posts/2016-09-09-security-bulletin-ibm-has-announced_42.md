IBM has announced a release for IBM Security Identity Governance and Intelligence (IGI) in response to security vulnerability. The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system. An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel’s networking subsystem processed TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) segments. Also, excessive resource consumption (while processing SACK blocks or for TCP connections with low MSS) allows remote denial of service.
