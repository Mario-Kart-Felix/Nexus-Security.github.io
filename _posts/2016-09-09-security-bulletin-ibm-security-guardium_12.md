CVEID:   CVE-2019-9500 DESCRIPTION:   CVSS Base score: 7.5CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/33xpP06 for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) CVEID:   CVE-2019-11833 DESCRIPTION:   fs/ext4/extents.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.2 does not zero out the unused memory region in the extent tree block, which might allow local users to obtain sensitive information by reading uninitialized data in the filesystem.CVSS Base score: 5.5CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/2Q2gcCn for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) CVEID:   CVE-2019-11810 DESCRIPTION:   An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.0.7. A NULL pointer dereference can occur when megasas\_create\_frame\_pool() fails in megasas\_alloc\_cmds() in drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid\_sas\_base.c. This causes a Denial of Service, related to a use-after-free.CVSS Base score: 6.2CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/2WWg6xA for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) CVEID:   CVE-2019-11599 DESCRIPTION:   The coredump implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.0.10 does not use locking or other mechanisms to prevent vma layout or vma flags changes while it runs, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service, or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering a race condition with mmget\_not\_zero or get\_task\_mm calls. This is related to fs/userfaultfd.c, mm/mmap.c, fs/proc/task\_mmu.c, and drivers/infiniband/core/uverbs\_main.c.CVSS Base score: 7.1CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/2CmWVnp for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H) CVEID:   CVE-2019-7222 DESCRIPTION:   The KVM implementation in the Linux kernel through 4.20.5 has an Information Leak.CVSS Base score: 2.8CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/2p0y85v for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N) CVEID:   CVE-2019-5489 DESCRIPTION:   The mincore() implementation in mm/mincore.c in the Linux kernel through 4.19.13 allowed local attackers to observe page cache access patterns of other processes on the same system, potentially allowing sniffing of secret information. (Fixing this affects the output of the fincore program.) Limited remote exploitation may be possible, as demonstrated by latency differences in accessing public files from an Apache HTTP Server.CVSS Base score: 5.1CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/2CnazH0 for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) CVEID:   CVE-2019-3900 DESCRIPTION:   An infinite loop issue was found in the vhost\_net kernel module in Linux Kernel up to and including v5.1-rc6, while handling incoming packets in handle\_rx(). It could occur if one end sends packets faster than the other end can process them. A guest user, maybe remote one, could use this flaw to stall the vhost\_net kernel thread, resulting in a DoS scenario.CVSS Base score: 7.5CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/2rqEJqI for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) CVEID:   CVE-2019-3882 DESCRIPTION:   A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's vfio interface implementation that permits violation of the user's locked memory limit. If a device is bound to a vfio driver, such as vfio-pci, and the local attacker is administratively granted ownership of the device, it may cause a system memory exhaustion and thus a denial of service (DoS). Versions 3.10, 4.14 and 4.18 are vulnerable.CVSS Base score: 4.7CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/32uT7Lo for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) CVEID:   CVE-2019-3460 DESCRIPTION:   A heap data infoleak in multiple locations including L2CAP\_PARSE\_CONF\_RSP was found in the Linux kernel before 5.1-rc1.CVSS Base score: 5.3CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/32nLy9i for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) CVEID:   CVE-2019-3459 DESCRIPTION:   A heap address information leak while using L2CAP\_GET\_CONF\_OPT was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.1-rc1.CVSS Base score: 5.3CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/2K2n2nP for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) CVEID:   CVE-2018-18281 DESCRIPTION:   SinceLinux kernel version 3.2, the mremap() syscall performs TLB flushes after dropping pagetable locks. If a syscall such as ftruncate() removes entries from the pagetables of a task that is in the middle of mremap(), a stale TLB entry can remain for a short time that permits access to a physical page after it has been released back to the page allocator and reused. This is fixed in the following kernel versions: 4.9.135, 4.14.78, 4.18.16, 4.19.CVSS Base score: 4.4CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/2oZL6Al for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N) CVEID:   CVE-2018-16885 DESCRIPTION:   A flaw was found in the Linux kernel that allows the userspace to call memcpy\_fromiovecend() and similar functions with a zero offset and buffer length which causes the read beyond the buffer boundaries, in certain cases causing a memory access fault and a system halt by accessing invalid memory address. This issue only affects kernel version 3.10.x as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.CVSS Base score: 6.2CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/2WUeoge for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) CVEID:   CVE-2018-16658 DESCRIPTION:   An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.18.6. An information leak in cdrom\_ioctl\_drive\_status in drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c could be used by local attackers to read kernel memory because a cast from unsigned long to int interferes with bounds checking. This is similar to CVE-2018-10940.CVSS Base score: 6.2CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/32uTaqy for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) CVEID:   CVE-2018-15594 DESCRIPTION:   arch/x86/kernel/paravirt.c in the Linux kernel before 4.18.1 mishandles certain indirect calls, which makes it easier for attackers to conduct Spectre-v2 attacks against paravirtual guests.CVSS Base score: 6.5CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/2NsEzre for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N) CVEID:   CVE-2018-14734 DESCRIPTION:   drivers/infiniband/core/ucma.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.11 allows ucma\_leave\_multicast to access a certain data structure after a cleanup step in ucma\_process\_join, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free).CVSS Base score: 7.5CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/32qdfOR for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) CVEID:   CVE-2018-14625 DESCRIPTION:   A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel where an attacker may be able to have an uncontrolled read to kernel-memory from within a vm guest. A race condition between connect() and close() function may allow an attacker using the AF\_VSOCK protocol to gather a 4 byte information leak or possibly intercept or corrupt AF\_VSOCK messages destined to other clients.CVSS Base score: 5.8CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/2Ct1sEE for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L) CVEID:   CVE-2018-13095 DESCRIPTION:   An issue was discovered in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs\_inode\_buf.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. A denial of service (memory corruption and BUG) can occur for a corrupted xfs image upon encountering an inode that is in extent format, but has more extents than fit in the inode fork.CVSS Base score: 5.5CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/2NwCcDX for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) CVEID:   CVE-2018-13094 DESCRIPTION:   An issue was discovered in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs\_attr\_leaf.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. An OOPS may occur for a corrupted xfs image after xfs\_da\_shrink\_inode() is called with a NULL bp.CVSS Base score: 5.5CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/2Nvayao for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) CVEID:   CVE-2018-13093 DESCRIPTION:   An issue was discovered in fs/xfs/xfs\_icache.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. There is a NULL pointer dereference and panic in lookup\_slow() on a NULL inode->i\_ops pointer when doing pathwalks on a corrupted xfs image. This occurs because of a lack of proper validation that cached inodes are free during allocation.CVSS Base score: 5.5CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/36PiOtl for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) CVEID:   CVE-2018-13053 DESCRIPTION:   The alarm\_timer\_nsleep function in kernel/time/alarmtimer.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3 has an integer overflow via a large relative timeout because ktime\_add\_safe is not used.CVSS Base score: 6.2CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/2CoeLX2 for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) CVEID:   CVE-2018-10853 DESCRIPTION:   A flaw was found in the way Linux kernel KVM hypervisor before 4.18 emulated instructions such as sgdt/sidt/fxsave/fxrstor. It did not check current privilege(CPL) level while emulating unprivileged instructions. An unprivileged guest user/process could use this flaw to potentially escalate privileges inside guest.CVSS Base score: 7.4CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/36EXDKu for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) CVEID:   CVE-2018-9517 DESCRIPTION:   In pppol2tp\_connect, there is possible memory corruption due to a use after free.
