CVEID:   CVE-2019-3855 DESCRIPTION:   An integer overflow flaw which could lead to an out of bounds write was discovered in libssh2 before 1.8.1 in the way packets are read from the server. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to execute code on the client system when a user connects to the server.CVSS Base score: 7.5CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/2xmHzMV for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) CVEID:   CVE-2019-3856 DESCRIPTION:   An integer overflow flaw, which could lead to an out of bounds write, was discovered in libssh2 before 1.8.1 in the way keyboard prompt requests are parsed. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to execute code on the client system when a user connects to the server.CVSS Base score: 7.5CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/34IsS6f for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) CVEID:   CVE-2019-3857 DESCRIPTION:   An integer overflow flaw which could lead to an out of bounds write was discovered in libssh2 before 1.8.1 in the way SSH\_MSG\_CHANNEL\_REQUEST packets with an exit signal are parsed. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to execute code on the client system when a user connects to the server.CVSS Base score: 7.5CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/2Yhvvti for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) CVEID:   CVE-2019-3863 DESCRIPTION:   A flaw was found in libssh2 before 1.8.1. A server could send a multiple keyboard interactive response messages whose total length are greater than unsigned char max characters. This value is used as an index to copy memory causing in an out of bounds memory write error.CVSS Base score: 7.5CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/2rb6B2j for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) CVEID:   CVE-2019-1559 DESCRIPTION:   If an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL\_shutdown() twice (once to send a close\_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable "non-stitched" ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL\_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2r (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2q).CVSS Base score: 5.8CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/2X61wnw for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N) CVEID:   CVE-2019-5489 DESCRIPTION:   The mincore() implementation in mm/mincore.c in the Linux kernel through 4.19.13 allowed local attackers to observe page cache access patterns of other processes on the same system, potentially allowing sniffing of secret information. (Fixing this affects the output of the fincore program.) Limited remote exploitation may be possible, as demonstrated by latency differences in accessing public files from an Apache HTTP Server.CVSS Base score: 5.1CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/2CnazH0 for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) CVEID:   CVE-2019-1125 DESCRIPTION:   An information disclosure vulnerability exists when certain central processing units (CPU) speculatively access memory, aka 'Windows Kernel Information Disclosure Vulnerability'. This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2019-1071, CVE-2019-1073.CVSS Base score: 5.9CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/36O93vo for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N) CVEID:   CVE-2018-17972 DESCRIPTION:   An issue was discovered in the proc\_pid\_stack function in fs/proc/base.c in the Linux kernel through 4.18.11. It does not ensure that only root may inspect the kernel stack of an arbitrary task, allowing a local attacker to exploit racy stack unwinding and leak kernel task stack contents.CVSS Base score: 6.2CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/2RdZvEE for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) CVEID:   CVE-2017-17805 DESCRIPTION:   The Salsa20 encryption algorithmin the Linux kernel before 4.14.8 does not correctly handle zero-length inputs, allowing a local attacker able to use the AF\_ALG-based skcipher interface (CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_USER\_API\_SKCIPHER) to cause a denial of service (uninitialized-memory free and kernel crash) or have unspecified other impact by executing a crafted sequence of system calls that use the blkcipher\_walk API. Both the generic implementation (crypto/salsa20\_generic.c) and x86 implementation (arch/x86/crypto/salsa20\_glue.c) of Salsa20 were vulnerable.CVSS Base score: 5.5CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/33HnIG3 for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) CVEID:   CVE-2019-11810 DESCRIPTION:   An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.0.7. A NULL pointer dereference can occur when megasas\_create\_frame\_pool() fails in megasas\_alloc\_cmds() in drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid\_sas\_base.c. This causes a Denial of Service, related to a use-after-free.CVSS Base score: 6.2CVSS Temporal Score: See: https://ift.tt/2WWg6xA for the current score.CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) CVEID:   CVE-2018-9568 DESCRIPTION:   In sk\_clone\_lock of sock.c, there is a possible memory corruption due to type confusion. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product: Android. Versions: Android kernel. Android ID: A-113509306.
