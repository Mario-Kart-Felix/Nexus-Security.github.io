Experts of the antivirus company Kaspersky Lab reported that in the discount season, also known as Black Friday, the number of threats from cyber fraudsters has grown significantly.  
  
"According to Kaspersky Lab, the number of phishing threats related to Black Friday has increased significantly over the past two weeks. On the eve of big sales and the upcoming holiday shopping season, cybercriminals are increasingly trying to attack users who prefer to shop online," said the antivirus company.  
  
So, in the period from 18 to 24 November, the company recorded almost twice as many fraudulent resources, compared to the previous week.  
  
The number of phishing attacks on online stores has also increased.“This growth is especially noticeable in Russia: if approximately every 20th phishing attack was sent to the e-commerce section in Runet two weeks ago, last week phishers tried to attack Russian online stores in every 11th case,” concluded company.  
  
As Kaspersky Lab content analyst Tatyana Sidorina noted, an increase in the percentage of phishing attacks is also expected in the upcoming New Year's sales. In addition, there are about 12% more such attacks in the fourth quarter than at other times of the year.  
  
It is interesting to note that earlier, Roskomnadzor warned about the appearance on the eve of Black Friday fraudulent sites that illegally collect personal data under the guise of sales.  
  
"Roskomnadzor experts note that the main purpose of collecting such data (name, phone number, email address, bank details, etc.) is to use them later as spammer databases and to steal bank card data,” stated the regulator.  
  
To avoid identity theft, Roskomnadzor recommends checking the originality of the domain of the online store and checking the presence of an SSL certificate. If the site address begins with http://, and not with https://, this is a reason to doubt the originality of the page.
