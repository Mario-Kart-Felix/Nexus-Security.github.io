**Employ Patches Immediately to Mitigate Holes in Pulse Secure VPN** (10/16/2019)  
The CERT Coordination Center has [advised](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/927237/) of at least 10 vulnerabilities in Pulse Secure's SSL VPN, which can allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to compromise the VPN server and connected clients. Pulse Secure released an out-of-band [advisory](https://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Security_Advisories/SA44101) along with software patches for the various affected products on April 24. This addressed a number of vulnerabilities including a remotecode execution with pre-authentication access. This vulnerability has no viable workarounds except for applying the patches provided by the vendor and performing required system updates.

**Mozilla Beefs Up Firefox Against Injection Attacks** (10/14/2019)  
[Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/) added new defenses to Firefox to deflect cyber threats. "To make Firefox resilient against such code injection attacks, we removed occurrences of inline scripts as well as removed eval()-like functions...Additionally we added assertions, disallowing the use of 'eval()' and its relatives in system-privileged script contexts.," Mozilla said in a [blog post](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2019/10/14/hardening-firefox-against-injection-attacks/).

  

**Nearly 220 Bugs in Oracle Products Neutralized** (10/16/2019)

**Sudo Flaw Exposes Linux Systems Via Root Access** (10/15/2019)  
[Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/) reported that a flaw was found in the way Sudo implemented running commands with arbitrary user ID.

Sudo [notified](https://www.sudo.ws/alerts/minus_1_uid.html) Red Hat of the bug and patched it in version 1.8.28.

  

**Undocumented, Mystery Boxes Expose Vessels, Crew to Possible Cyber Attacks** (10/16/2019)  
Undocumented systems or devices on ships leave the vessels exposed to cyber attacks, the researchers at [Pen Test Partners](https://www.pentestpartners.com/) [say](https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/unmasking-mystery-boxes-on-ships-bridges/). While assessing vessel and platform types across different fleets and operators, the researchers found systems or devices that the crew either did not know existed or had no idea what they were used for. In one case, the team found an undocumented device connected to a ship's main engine. The crew did not know what the device did, its hardware was not labeled, and it had been installed by a third-party years prior, but that arrangement with the third-party had ended. Pen Test Partners' Andrew Tierney said, "Let that sink in. A vulnerable box that no-one knew about with a direct, remote connection to the main engine." Such vulnerable devices can lead to vessel damage or crew death via an attacker-controlled cyber attack.

  

**VMware Patches Bug in Harbor Container Registry for PCF** (10/16/2019)  
An [update](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2019-0016.html) from [VMware](http://www.vmware.com/) has been issued to address a broken access control vulnerability affecting Harbor Container Registry for Pivotal Cloud Foundry. This flaw could enable an attacker to gain control of a vulnerable system.

The vulnerability can be potentially exploited by sending a malicious request to either the Web Admin or SSL VPN consoles, which would enable an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
