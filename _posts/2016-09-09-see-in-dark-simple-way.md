Night vision googles used to be the exclusive preserve of the military, and then of the well-heeled. Image intensifier tubes were very expensive, and needed high-voltage power supplies to keep them going. Now that we have solid-state infra-red cameras the task of seeing in the dark had become much simpler, and \[Alex Zidros\] is here to show us just how easy that can be. [His night vision goggles](https://github.com/aziddy/nightvison_goggles) take a selection of off-the-shelf parts and a little bit of 3D printing to produce a complete set-up for a fraction of the cost of those night-vision goggles of old.

At its heart is a little NTSC/PAL LCD display in a 3D printed bracket. These used to be a small display of choice, but we see them rarely now because standalone displays and the microcontrollers to drive them have become so much more useful. Driving the display is a video camera with its IR filter removed, and providing illumination is an IR flashlight. In effect it’s a classic analogue CCTV system in miniature, but the most important thing is that it works.

[We might have expected a Raspberry Pi Zero](https://hackaday.com/2017/11/29/rage-against-the-dying-of-the-light-with-a-raspi-night-vision-camera/) and NoIR camera, but it’s difficult to argue with a functioning night vision system. If you want to look at a project with an image intensifier tube though, [we’ve covered one of those in the past](https://hackaday.com/2019/04/10/see-whats-inside-night-vision-and-how-to-build-your-own/).
