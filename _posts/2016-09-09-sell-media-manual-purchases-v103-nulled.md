An extension for Sell Media that allows to manual purchases.
------------------------------------------------------------

### Allows buyers to arrange an offline payment (check, wire, cash, etc) with sellers.

The Manual Purchases extension for the Sell Media plugin allows buyers to arrange an offline payment (check, wire, cash, etc) with sellers on the checkout page. This is useful if you have established, pre-existing payment arrangements with your buyers. See how it works below.

PayPal is the default payment gateway available in Sell Media. With the Manual Purchases extension activated, an additional payment option will appear above PayPal.

When the Manual Purchase radio button is selected, additional fields will be shown to buyers so they can bypass the PayPal or (Stripe) payment gateways altogether.

After the buyer fills out the fields and clicks Checkout Now, an email will be sent to either the seller or the contributor (the creator of the work).
