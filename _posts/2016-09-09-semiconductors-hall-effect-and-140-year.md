> In a new study in the journal _Nature_, an IBM Research-led collaboration describes an exciting breakthrough in a 140-year-old mystery in physics—one that enables us to unlock the physical characteristics of semiconductors in much greater detail and aid in the development of new and improved [semiconductor](https://phys.org/tags/semiconductor/)materials.
> 
> To truly understand the physics of semiconductors, we first need to know the fundamental properties of the [charge carriers](https://phys.org/tags/charge+carriers/) inside the materials, whether those particles are positive or negative, their speed under an applied electric field and how densely they are packed in the material. Physicist Edwin Hall found a way to determine those properties in 1879, when he discovered that a magnetic field will deflect the movement of electronic charges inside a conductor and that the amount of deflection can be measured as a voltage perpendicular to the flow of charge as shown in Fig. 1a. This voltage, known as the Hall voltage, unlocks essential information about the charge carriers in a semiconductor, including whether they are negative electrons or positive quasi-particles called “holes,” how fast they move in an [electric field](https://phys.org/tags/electric+field/) or their “mobility” (µ) and their density (n) inside the semiconductor.
