Davis Sachs speaks on YouTube ([above](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7JQ7Rpwn2k)) about using motion processing via the sensors on Android devices.

> Gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses are increasingly prevalent in mainstream consumer electronics. Applications of these sensors include user interface, augmented reality, gaming, image stabilization, and navigation.
> 
> This talk demonstrates how all three sensor types work separately and in conjunction on a modified Android handset running a modified sensor API, then explain how algorithms are used to enable a multitude of applications.

David Sachs began developing motion processing systems as a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab. His research there led him to InvenSense, where he continues this work with MEMS inertial sensors used in products such as the Nintendo Wii Motion Plus. Davidâ€™s designs incorporate gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses in various combinations and contexts including handset user interfaces, image stabilizers, navigation systems, game controllers, novel Braille displays, and musical instruments.
