Sensor Saturday – On-device Magnetometer Calibration ([video](https://youtu.be/ueiXWDtLmR0)). The Adafruit CLUE board comes with a magnetometer & magnetometers need calibration before use. Sometimes a program is used to help calibrate but since there’s a screen, we can calibrate on-board using the display. Before calibration, the X/Y/Z data is shown as red, green and blue balls of datapoints that are not centered. Once you see enough data, press A to calibrate. Then the X/Y/Z data will be calibrated-centered!
