### Does Google penalise Websites with Pop-ups?(Answer is based on SEO purpose)

> The quick answer is probably – it depends on if your pop-up is taken into account intrusive. though you manage to totally optimize your pop-ups it doesn’t mean that you simply will act and fill your webpages with them. At least, not if you wish to be found by Google. Some guests merely shut the window and move aloof from your web site if they fall upon a pop-up. to induce guests to stay around longer on your webpages, and to induce Google to list you in a very search result, you would like to make sure that the pop-ups don't seem to be intrusive to the user.

Now a popup window opens pointing to that page when users click somewhere on your blog.

There’s good reason behind this. Google’s end-game will always be to improve the user-experience. They believe that these intrusive interstitials create a poor experience for users and ultimately impact their bounce rate, their exit rate, and even their time onsite. If content is immediate and uninterrupted, consumers are far more likely to explore the site and ultimately make the conversion. Feedback from users has been overwhelmingly positive, as evidenced by the many different social posts to that effect.

Now, there are some exceptions. The specific verbiage from Google is that the following examples “would not be affected by the new signal, if used responsibly.” Interstitials that reference a legal obligation don’t fall into the negative bucket. Examples would be age verification or forewarning of cookie usage. Another area is login dialogs, where the content of a site isn’t indexable publicly.  
  
So how do you know the quality of your user experience and whether certain design elements may be harming your conversion rates? The best way is to analyse certain metrics. The ones that we would recommend tracking are browse rate, bounce rate, return visitor rate and time on site. You can track these using Google Analytics (which will have the best indication of how your site fares on Google). When in doubt, keep the design of your site simple, clean and explore it from the perspective of your customers.
