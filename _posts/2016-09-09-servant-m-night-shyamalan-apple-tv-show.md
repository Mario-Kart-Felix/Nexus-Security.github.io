Servant, a new TV series executive produced by M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Glass), will premiere on November 28, exclusive to Apple TV+. Apple's new streaming service hasn't gotten off to the most exciting start, but Servant looks interesting, to say the least. The [first trailer](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/m-night-shyamalans-new-apple-tv-trailer-shows-baby/1100-6471216/) introduced us to the overarching plot of the series--an in-denial mother hires a nanny to look after the hyper-realistic doll that has replaced her deceased infant son, and it soon becomes clear that something is off about said nanny.

This new trailer, titled "Jericho" (the name of the doll), focuses in on the doll's creation, as the baby is sculpted, with the artist threading in hairs and choosing eyeballs for the infantile facsimile. It's a riff on Pinocchio, albeit a horrifying one. You can watch it below, and then start debating with yourself whether or not the doll is meant to seem alive or not in the shot of its mother picking it up.

The series will run for ten episodes, and features Lauren Ambrose, Nell Tiger Free, Rupert Grint, and Toby Kebbell. The pilot is directed by M. Night Shyamalan, and the show is created by Tony Basgallop. It's quite different from anything you're likely to see on the more family-friendly [Disney +](https://www.cnet.com/news/disney-plus-streaming-service-everything-to-know-prices-shows-movies-marvel-star-wars-pixar/), which also just recently launched.
