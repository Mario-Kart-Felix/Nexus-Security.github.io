Customization is what I look for when a typical watch face seems a bit mundane. While Apple does offer a handful of watch faces, they don’t quite add the eye-catching factor to the smartwatch. That’s why I often like to set my favorite photo as Apple Watch face. Moreover, watchOS allows users to add some personal touch to the mix so that the custom watch face can stand out. Times when you may want your wearable device to get along nicely with your style quotient, it could be the right way to go. Sounds interesting? Let me show you how you can use any photo as a watch face on your Apple Watch.

How to Set Photos As Apple Watch Faces
--------------------------------------

  

Just in case you are thinking whether or not your Apple Watch supports this cool feature, let me tell you that it works even on older watchOS versions. So, incompatibility shouldn’t be a problem even if you are using older Apple Watch models. Talking about the process, there are multiple ways to get it done. What’s more, you can also sync your memory or favorite photo album so that every time you raise your wrist or hit the display, the smartwatch would show a new watch face.

Use an Image As Watch Face on Apple Watch
-----------------------------------------

  

So, that’s how you can use a nice image as your watch face on your wearable device. It’s indeed good that Apple offers a way to give the face a custom look. From a personalization perspective, it’s a cool feature, isn’t it? Though watchOS has always been more than decent, the latest iteration seems to have taken the game a few notches higher thanks to the addition of some appreciable features like [Cycle Tracking](https://beebom.com/set-up-cycle-tracking-ios-13-watchos-6/) and [Hearing Health](https://beebom.com/set-up-noise-app-measure-decibel-levels-apple-watch/).
