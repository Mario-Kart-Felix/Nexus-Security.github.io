> As telescopes have become more automated, astronomical data have evolved from a trickle to a roaring river. During its primary and extended missions, Kepler identified nearly 5,000 confirmed and candidate exoplanets. The first candidates came in small doses, allowing astronomers to get to know them well. But later observations came in giant batches that were more challenging to parse.

> “For resonance structure, it seems sound is in a better position than sight to do the job of picking out frequencies in particular,” Fabrycky said.
