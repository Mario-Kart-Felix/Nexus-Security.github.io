Hot on the heels of Asus’ ROG Phone 2 launch, with its 120Hz display and an honestly amazing price, Japan’s Sharp has apparently decided to one-up the Taiwanese company. Sharp has today launched the Sharp Aquos Zero 2 — a flagship smartphone that comes with top of the line specs, and an insane 240Hz OLED display.  

The Sharp Aquos Zero 2 packs in a 6.4-inch FullHD+ OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate, that means users can expect insanely smooth animations and UI experience on the phone, even though actual content that supports 240Hz refresh rates is not very readily available. Most games are just now bringing support for 120Hz, thanks to the ROG Phone 2, so 240Hz, especially on games is definitely far out as of right now. Still, a 240Hz OLED panel is definitely a feat for Sharp to be proud of.  

Display aside, the Sharp Aquos Zero 2 is a flagship through and through. The phone comes with the Snapdragon 855 Mobile Platform, paired with 8GB RAM and 256GB internal storage (no mention of the UFS standard it’s using, but it will most likely be UFS 2.1 and not UFS 3.0).  

There’s also a 3,130mAh battery, which seems ridiculously small for a 6.4-inch display with a 240Hz refresh rate, and I have serious doubts about the battery performance on the Aquos Zero 2. Other than that, the phone packs in a 12.1MP primary + 21.1MP ultra-wide dual camera set-up on the back, along with an 8MP selfie shooter. There’s also an in-display fingerprint scanner, and support for face unlock on the phone.  

With all of those exciting numbers, Sharp did not mention a price for the phone, or any details about global availability for it, but we’ll definitely keep an ear to the ground and update this story when more information becomes available. So check back often.
