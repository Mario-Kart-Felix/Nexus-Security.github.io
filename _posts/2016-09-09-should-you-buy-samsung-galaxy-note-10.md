The Galaxy Note 10 is Samsung’s 2019 addition to the popular Note range. Large displays, smart styluses, and impressive hardware are the hallmarks of this particular brand.

But should you buy the Galaxy Note 10? Here are the phone’s best features, the Galaxy Note 10’s price, and a few alternative smartphones that might also interest you.

What Is the Galaxy Note 10?
---------------------------

[Samsung Galaxy Note 10](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Factory-Unlocked-Warranty/dp/B07V5KSWXM?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07V5KSWXM) [Samsung Galaxy Note 10](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Factory-Unlocked-Warranty/dp/B07V5KSWXM?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07V5KSWXM) [Buy Now On Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Factory-Unlocked-Warranty/dp/B07V5KSWXM?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07V5KSWXM) $949.99

Like previous Note devices, the range offers bigger displays, more RAM, and bigger batteries than the standard Galaxy S smartphones.

However, 2019 was the first time that Samsung introduced two versions of a Note device at launch. The Galaxy Note 10 comes in two variants; the [Galaxy Note 10](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Factory-Unlocked-Warranty/dp/B07V5KSWXM/) and the [Galaxy Note 10+](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Factory-Unlocked-Warranty/dp/B07V4H4FBL/).

The Galaxy Note 10 has a smaller profile than the typical Note device. With a 6.3-inch display, the Note 10 is the same size as the Galaxy S10+. With a 3500mAh battery, it also only has a slightly larger battery than the standard Galaxy S10.

In many ways, the Note 10 is essentially a Galaxy S10 with a stylus.

The Note 10 is no slouch in the hardware department, offing:

*   **Display:**6.3-inch 2280×1080 FHD+ display with dynamic AMOLED
*   **Battery:**3500mAh
*   **RAM:**8GB (LTE), 12GB (5G)
*   **Storage:**256GB
*   **Main camera:**Triple lens camera
    *   16MP ultra-wide
    *   12MP wide-angle
    *   12MP telephoto
*   **Front-facing camera:**10MP selfie camera

The Galaxy Note 10+ is much more representative of a typical Note smartphone. It comes with a large 6.8-inch display, making it the largest display Samsung has used to-date. The Note 10+ excels in the hardware department, too:

*   **Display:**6.8-inch 3040×1440 Quad HD+ with dynamic AMOLED
*   **Battery:**4300mAh
*   **RAM:**12GB
*   **Storage:**256GB/512GB
*   **Main camera:**Quad camera
    *   16MP ultra-wide
    *   12MP wide-angle
    *   12MP telephoto
    *   DepthVision lens
*   **Front-facing camera:**10MP selfie camera

Are There Alternatives to the Galaxy Note 10?
---------------------------------------------

The Note 10 and Note 10+ launched with retail prices starting at $949 and $1,099, respectively—making them some of Samsung’s most expensive smartphones.

In 2019, many brands launched flagships over the $1,000 mark. However, this doesn’t mean that every consumer views it as a good deal or value-for-money.

The Note 10 and Note 10+ are good devices, but their price is likely to give you second thoughts about purchasing them. So if you want impressive hardware and productivity features, but at better price points, what are a few alternatives you can consider?

1\. [Samsung Galaxy S10+](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Factory-Unlocked-Warranty/dp/B07N4L36H7)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Samsung Galaxy S10+](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Factory-Unlocked-Warranty/dp/B07N4L36H7?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07N4L36H7) [Samsung Galaxy S10+](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Factory-Unlocked-Warranty/dp/B07N4L36H7?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07N4L36H7) [Buy Now On Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Factory-Unlocked-Warranty/dp/B07N4L36H7?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07N4L36H7) $999.99

The [Samsung Galaxy S10+](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Factory-Unlocked-Warranty/dp/B07N4L36H7) is a great alternative to the Note 10. Firstly, it already shares many of the same hardware features as the Note 10, including an impressive 4100mAh battery and large 6.3-inch edge-to-edge display. It also has a triple-lens main camera setup and a dual front-facing camera.

Samsung also updated the phone’s software, which brings certain Note 10 features (such as AR Emojis and an enhanced night mode) to the S10 range. If you want to stay with Samsung as a brand, but the Note 10 doesn’t appeal to you, the S10+ is highly rated by reviewers and consumers alike and is one of the best smartphones of 2019.

It also includes a pop-up selfie camera and an in-display fingerprint sensor—the reasons behind its notch-free screen. The OnePlus 7 Pro also has a 4000mAh battery, supports between 6GB and 12GB of RAM, and includes a Snapdragon 855 octa-core processor. Reviewers note the phone has impressive performance and offers you value-for-money.

The [Huawei P30 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/HUAWEI-Factory-Unlocked-International-Version/dp/B07Q2WPMNB) ranks among the best smartphones of 2019 and doesn’t suffer the same Android services uncertainty seen with the Mate 30 release.

Meanwhile, the selfie camera has one of the highest resolutions you’ll find on a smartphone, with a 32MP front-facing lens. In fact, with a 4200mAh battery and a quad-camera setup, the P30 Pro’s hardware outpaces many of the standard Note 10’s specs. The only thing it’s really missing is a stylus.
