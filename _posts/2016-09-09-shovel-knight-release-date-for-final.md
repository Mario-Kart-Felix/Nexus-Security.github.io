[Shovel Knight](https://www.gamespot.com/shovel-knight/), the 2014 indie darling that started life on the Wii U and 3DS before eventually making its way to the current generation of systems, is due for one last major update. Two expansions will release soon for owners of the Treasure Trove edition of the game, and now we have a release date for them.  
  
Developer Yacht Club Games has announced on Twitter that Shovel Knight: King of Cards and Shovel Knight: Showdown will both release on December 10. The games will be available as part of the Treasure Trove collection, or can be purchased separately from digital storefronts. In King of Cards, players will take on the role of the titular king, and Yacht Club Games is [promising](https://yachtclubgames.com/2019/08/shovel-knight-king-of-cards-trailer/) that it will feature "more levels, mechanics, secrets, and content than any Shovel Knight game to come before it." Showdown is a multiplayer spin-off, which offers a competitive take on the Shovel Knight formula, complete will a full story mode and AI bots.

Shovel Knight Showdown will not be available on 3DS or PS Vita, whereas King of Cards will be made available on all systems. The game also still has a [trio of amiibo](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/three-fantastic-new-amiibo-figures-announced-based/1100-6453063/) on the way, based on Plague Knight, Specter Knight, and King Knight, and the game is getting a [new physical release](https://yachtclubgames.com/2019/11/final-release-date-for-all-things-shovel-knight-treasure-trove/) that will bundle together all of this content on December 10 as well (although the PS4 physical release has been delayed into 2020).  
  
While this will wrap up the Treasure Trove collection, there's already another Shovel Knight game in the works--[Shovel Knight Dig](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shovel-knight-dig-announced-has-strong-steamworld-/1100-6469447/), which will see Shovel Knight using his shovel for its intended purpose through underground dungeons. Yacht Club Games also has another game in the works, [Cyber Shadow](https://www.gamespot.com/videos/cyber-shadow-pax-east-2019-gameplay-unleashing-dar/2300-6449047/), which is a retro-styled ninja action game. It's not yet clear when either game will launch.
