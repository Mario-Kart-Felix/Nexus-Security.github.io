An evolution of the classic game Snake. There are four snakes each one with a different color. Only one snake moves. There are four kinds of foods with the same colors as the snakes. When the active snake eats a food the snake with the same color starts moving, and the current one stops. The goal is to eat as much food as possible.

**It's easier to play than to explain!**
