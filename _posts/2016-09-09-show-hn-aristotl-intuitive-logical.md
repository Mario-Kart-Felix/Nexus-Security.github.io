© 2019 Andrew Wei. [Aristotl](https://www.aristotl.io) is an experimental tool designed to make looking up logical fallacies more efficient. Fallacy descriptions, examples, definitions, etc., are sourced externally as listed in each content entry and are rearranged by myself for presentation clarity. Full credits go to the respective authors of these sources.
