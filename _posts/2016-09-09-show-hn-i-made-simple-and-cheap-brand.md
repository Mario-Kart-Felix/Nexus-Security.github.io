### **Brandchirps – the reliable, cost-efficient, and simple brand monitoring service you’ve been looking for**

**What Are You?**  
A small company with no overhead trying to help others scour the web for recent or updated mentions of keywords they want to monitor and track.  
  
These could be your brand, a competitor’s brand, or just any term that interest you.  
  
We find these mentions and provide you the results so you can improve your bottom line.  
  

**Why Do I Need This?**  
I’ll tell you why I needed this same service first, in hopes you can see why you should want it too.  
  
I wanted a tool that could reliably and completely scan the internet for mentions of my company’s brand name so I could react to both positive and negative news and conversations quickly.  
  
Later, I learned to do the same for my competitor’s brand names to jump in and promote my brand based on their conversations.  
  
Currently, I track mentions of keywords in my industry to further expose my brand to even more potential customers.  
  

**Why Brandchirps Over Another Similar Tool?**  
( similar to asking questions like Brandmentions alternative or Brandmentions vs type info )  
  
Good question.  
  
Most other similar alternatives don’t monitor the whole web. Most will only monitor specific platforms like Twitter. _**We monitor the web and multiple social networks.**_  
  
Many others will limit how many records they will pull for you every month ( 5 keywords, but only 3,000 records per month collected ). _**We do not limit the number of records we find on your keywords.**_  
  
A lot of them are very expensive ( starting at $99 a month vs our $6.97 a month ), don’t offer an API, or just don’t work very well. _**We offer plans starting at $6.97, and an API, and we ensure our service is easy to use & battle-tested to run daily.**_
