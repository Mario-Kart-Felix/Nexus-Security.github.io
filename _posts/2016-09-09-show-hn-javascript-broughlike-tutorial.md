JavaScript Broughlike Tutorial
==============================

This is a tutorial about writing a broughlike (a small roguelike game similar to

[868-HACK](https://store.steampowered.com/app/274700/868HACK/)

or

[Cinco Paus](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cinco-paus/id1249999336)

) from scratch in JavaScript.

Check out the

[Introduction](https://nluqo.github.io/broughlike-tutorial/stage0.html)

to see why I created this and how it differs from other tutorials.
