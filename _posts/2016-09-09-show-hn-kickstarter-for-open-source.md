For Project Leaders
-------------------

### Find funding opportunities

One of our main goals at OpenTeams is to channel more funding and resources into community-driven projects, to support transparency in their governance, and keep the communities around them healthy and accelerate their development. We do this in a way that keeps the community in charge of its destiny.

### Recognize all contributors

OpenTeams provides a platform for you to recognize all of your contributors for code written, talks given, issues closed, conversations facilitated, ideas provided, or anything else that makes the project successful.

### Help potential Sponsors

Sponsors want to know what features the project itself wants to work on and participate in the conversation about what to fund. Open Source communities currently have many ad hoc and often opaque ways to decide what to work on. OpenTeams will provide a clear way for verified project leaders to let sponsors know which features have support from the community as well as any commitments.
