A powerful modal editor written in python.

vy is a modal editor with a very modular architecture. vy is built on top of Tkinter which is one of the most productive graphical toolkits; It permits vy to have such a great programming interface for plugins. Python is such an amazing language; it turns vy such a powerful application because its plugin API is high level naturally.

In vy it is easy to create modes like it is in emacs, modes that support programming languages, provide all kind of functionalities that varies from accessing irc or email checking. The set of keys used in vy was carefully chosen to be handy although it is possible to make vy look like vim or emacs.

The syntax highlighting plugin is very minimalistic and extremely fast. It supports syntax highlighting for all languages that python-pygments supports. The source code of the syntax highlighting plugin is about 120 lines of code. It is faster than the syntax highlighting plugins of both vim and emacs. :) It is possible to easily implement new syntax highlighting themes that work for all languages because it uses python pygments styles scheme.

There is a simple and consistent terminal-like plugin in vy that turns it possible to talk to external processes. Such a feature is very handy when dealing with interpreters. One can just drop pieces of code to an interpreter then check the results.

vy implements a Python debugger plugin and auto completion that permits debugging Python code easily and in a very cool way. One can set break points, remove break points, run the code then see the cursor jumping to the line that is being executed and much more.

It is possible to open multiple vertical/horizontal panes to edit different files. Such a feature makes it possible to edit multiple files in a given tab. vy supports multiple tabs as well with a handy scheme of keys to switch focus between tabs and panes.

There is a vyrc file written in Python that is very well documented and organized to make it simple to load plugins and set stuff at startup. You can take the best out of vy with no need to learn some odd language like vimscript or emacs LISP; since vy is written in Python, you use Python to develop for it.

All built-in functions are well documented, which simplifies the process of plugin development as well as personalizing stuff. The plugins are documented: the documentation can be accessed from vy by dropping Python code to the interpreter.

==========================================================

**Note:** vy requires Python3 to run, python2 support is no longer available.

```
cd /tmp/ pip download vy tar -zxvf vy-* cd vy-*/ pip install -r requirements.txt python setup.py install 
```

**Note:** As vy is in development there may occur some changes to the vyrc file format, it is important to remove your ~/.vy directory before a new installation in order to upgrade to a new version.
