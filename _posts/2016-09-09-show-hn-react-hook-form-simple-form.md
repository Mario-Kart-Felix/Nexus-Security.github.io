React Hook Form
===============

Performant, flexible and extensible forms with easy to use for validation.

Reduce Rendering
================

Do you ever wonder how many component re-renders have been triggered by the user? React Hook Form embraces uncontrolled form validation to reduce unnecessary performance impact.

**Note:** You can swipe through the following videos to see how they work.

Faster Mounting
===============

The following results demonstrate: how long it took to render the components. Results are captured under 6x CPU slow down on App start with Chrome dev tools' performance tab, and code is from the section above [Library Code Comparison](https://react-hook-form.com/#codeComparison).

Live Demo
=========

The following form demonstrates form validation in action. Each column represents what has been captured in the custom hook. You can also change fields in the form by clicking the **EDIT** button.

===============================

Form validation should be much simpler. React Hook Form will lead you to write less code and have better performance. Check out the get started section and learn more on the API documentation page.
