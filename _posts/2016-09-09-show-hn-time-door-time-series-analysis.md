Designed for real-world data
----------------------------

Time series data is often incomplete, non-stationary, and fast. Time Door is designed to handle all these properties:

*   Every endpoint provides **advanced value imputation** methods to replace missing values
*   Endpoints with data assumptions provide **(automatic) data transformations** to deliver valid results
*   Endpoints that compute moving statistics can process hundreds of new data points per second, making them ideal for **fast data streams**
