Hey everyone, I'm trying to validate an idea and would love your feedback.

I'm big into email but not big into clutter; and the more windows I have open on my desktop the more cluttered my mind is. To this point, I've built a very minimal email desktop client that helps me stay on top of my inbox without having to keep a dedicated window open.

Would you use this? If there is enough feedback, I'd be interested in finishing the code and releasing an MVP. It's customizable so you can choose fonts/bgs/sizes to your liking.
