We’ve noticed a rash of builds of \[ FedorSosnin’s\] do-it-yourself 3D-printed mechanical keyboard, [SiCK-68](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3478494/makes) lately. The cost is pretty low — SiCK stands for Super, Inexpensive, Cheap, Keyboard. According to the [bill of materials](https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/9c/58/5b/49/69/SiCK-68_Cost_Breakdown.pdf), the original cost about $50. Of course, that doesn’t include the cost of the 3D printer and soldering gear, but who doesn’t have all that already?

The brains behind this is a Teensy that scans the hand-wired key matrix. So the only electronics here are the switches, each with a companion diode, and the Teensy. The [EasyAVR](https://github.com/dhowland/EasyAVR) software does all the logical work both as firmware and a configuration GUI.

If you look at the many different builds, each has its own character. Yet they look overwhelmingly professional — like something you might buy at a store. This is the kind of project that would have been extremely difficult to pull off a decade ago. You could build the keyboard, of course, but making it look like a finished product was beyond most of us unless we were willing to make enough copies to justify having special tooling made to mold the cases.

PCBs are cheap now and we might be tempted to use one here. There are quite a few methods for using a 3D printer to create a board, so that would be another option. The hand wiring seems like it would be a drag, although manageable. If you need wiring [inspiration](https://hackaday.com/2019/09/27/the-zen-of-mechanical-keyboard-wiring/), we can help.

For ultimate geek cred, combine this with [Ploopy](https://hackaday.com/2019/11/01/ploopy-open-source-trackball-keeps-rolling-along/).
