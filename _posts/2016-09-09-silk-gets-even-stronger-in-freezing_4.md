> Silk, that luxurious material spun by insects and arachnids, is one of the most important natural fibers on Earth due to its high tensile strength, smooth texture, and insulating properties.
> 
> Now, scientists have discovered another silk superpower—the ability to withstand the cold temperatures of outer space.
> 
> This property, called cryogenic toughness, is rare in complex polymer materials like silk. When these materials are exposed to frigid temperatures approaching -200°C (-328°F), they typically become cracked and brittle. But some silks actually became stronger and more stretchable in the cold, according to a study published on Thursday in the journal Materials Chemistry Frontiers.
