Via Allen Lee at [meowworkshop.org](https://www.meoworkshop.org/about/) comes work with audio processing methods.

> There are a lot of musically savvy engineers who, after their first signal processing course, use their newfound knowledge to build an effects pedal of sorts. I definitely put myself in this category.
> 
> Over the next while, I will be messing around with different audio processing methods like filtering, reverberation, wavetables and whatever I feel like playing around with.
> 
> For this post, I am going to go through the hardware setup. The firmware setup will be covered in the next post.

The project uses the Silicon Labs EFM32 [Pearl Gecko Starter Board](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/mcu/32-bit/efm32-pearl-gecko-pg12-starter-kit).

> While it is a little pricey (~100 USD), there’s a lot to like about it. It comes with an LCD screen, plenty of pin breakouts, buttons, capsense pads and perhaps most relevant, a built-in ADC and DAC.
> 
> As an added bonus, the EFM32 PG12 includes an ARM Cortex M4 core **with** a dedicated floating point unit (FPU) that will speed up our computations. Using an ARM core also allows us to take advantage of the CMSIS DSP libraries that should give us an extra processing boost.
