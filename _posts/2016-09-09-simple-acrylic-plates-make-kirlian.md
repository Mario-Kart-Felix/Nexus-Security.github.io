We know, we know – “Kirlian photography” is a term loaded with pseudoscientific baggage. Paranormal researchers have longed claimed that Kirlian photography can explore the mood or emotional state of a subject through the “aura”, an energy field said to surround and emanate from all living things. It’s straight-up nonsense, of course, but that doesn’t detract from the beauty of plasma aficionado \[Jay Bowles\]’ [images produced by capacitive coupling and corona discharge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRKIGhOJ5Ew).

Technically, what \[Jay\] is doing here is not quite Kirlian photography. The classic setup for “electrophotography” is a sandwich of photographic film, a glass plate, and a metal ground plate. An object with a high-voltage, high-frequency power supply attached is placed on top of the sandwich, and the resulting corona discharge exposes the film. \[Jay\]’s version is a thin chamber made of two pieces of solvent-welded acrylic and filled with water. A bolt between the acrylic panes conducts current from a Tesla coil – perhaps [this one](https://hackaday.com/2017/11/25/low-end-parts-make-tesla-coil-with-a-high-end-look/) that we’ve featured before – into the water. When something is placed on the acrylic, a beautiful purple corona discharge streams out from the object.

It’s an eerie effect, and it’s easy to see how people can see an aura and attribute mystical properties to it. In the end, though, it’s not much different than touching [a plasma globe](https://hackaday.com/2019/10/25/build-your-own-plasma-ball/), and just about as safe. Feeling a bit more destructive? Corona discharge is a great way to make art, both [in wood](https://hackaday.com/2015/07/04/high-voltage-wood-and-resin-result-in-fractal-art/) and [in acrylic](https://hackaday.com/2015/01/08/putting-lightning-in-acrylic/).
