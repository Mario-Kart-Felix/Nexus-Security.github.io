ESP8266 development boards like the Wemos D1 Mini and NodeMCU are an excellent way to get a one-off project up and rolling quickly, but their size and relative complexity mean they aren’t necessarily a good choice for even short-run production hardware. On the other hand, programming the bare ESP modules can be something of a pain. But thanks to \[Greg Frost\], [flashing those tiny little boards just got a lot easier](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3995162).

On the back side there’s just a few jumper wires and a couple of resistors, which ultimately lead to the FT232R FTDI board that actually connects the chip to the computer so you can program it.

We’d like to see a back panel that encloses the wiring, and perhaps an alternate version that deletes the space for the FTDI board in favor of a row of header pins. Both easy enough modifications to the basic design should \[Greg\] or anyone else feel so inclined. But even as it is, this is a great little programmer that can sourced and assembled easily and cheaply.

This [isn’t the first 3D printed ESP8266 programmer](https://hackaday.com/2018/03/27/3d-printed-esp8266-programming-jig/) we’ve seen, [and there are some improvised versions](https://hackaday.com/2019/05/18/breakout-board-becomes-pogo-pin-programmer/) which are even cheaper to put together, but this design has a certain professional look that we think will be right at home on your bench.
