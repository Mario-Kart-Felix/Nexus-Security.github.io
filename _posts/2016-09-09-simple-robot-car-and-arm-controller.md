We don’t have robot arm in our shop anymore, but [HyperChiicken](https://www.hackster.io/HyperChiicken) has a project up on [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/HyperChiicken/armin-v2-simple-robot-car-and-arm-controller-using-python-00db68) that’s a robot arm build based on a Raspberry Pi. Check out ARMin v2!

> Control servos/motors connected to a robot car and arm kit using a Raspberry Pi, Python, and an Xbox 360 controller.

> This project is an extension of my previous ARMin project. I decided to combine an old car kit to the mix. So I cobbled it together with the robot arm which brings us to ARMin v2!
