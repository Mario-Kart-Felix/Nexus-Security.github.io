> This post will show you how you can build a simple time-lapse camera using a Raspberry Pi. The resolution, duration and time can be easily updated in the script. We have created something similar using the ESP32-CAM board but the Raspberry Pi camera quality is much better than that and hence the results are also better than the previous version.
