Have you ever looked around your city’s layout and thought you could do better? Maybe you’ve always wanted to see how she’d run on nuclear or wind power, or just play around with civic amenities and see how your choices affect the citizens.

\[Robbe Nagel\] made [this physical-digital simulator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4RsZYuA3tM) for a Creative Programming class within an industrial design program. We don’t have all the details, but as \[Robbe\] explains in the video after the break, each block has a resistor on the bottom, and each cubbyhole has a pair of contacts ready to mate with it. An Arduino nestled safely in the LEGO bunker below reads the different resistance values to determine what block was placed where.

\[Robbe\] wrote a program that evaluates various layouts and provides statistics for things like population, overall health, education level, pollution, etc. As you can see after the break, these values change as soon as blocks are added or removed. Part of what makes this simulator so cool is that it could be used for serious purposes, or it could be totally gamified.

It’s no secret that we like LEGO, especially as an enclosure material. [Dress it up](https://hackaday.com/2019/09/11/custom-lego-server-case-looks-as-though-it-came-straight-from-a-data-center/) or [dress it down](https://hackaday.com/2019/10/26/lego-and-minecraft-team-up-for-custom-gaming-pc-case/), just don’t leave any pieces on the floor.
