Singapore Ministry of Defence (Mindef) has kicked off its second bug bounty programme in hopes of uncovering vulnerabilities in 11 internet-facing systems and websites. It has engaged previous collaborator HackerOne, inviting 400 white-hat hackers to participate in this year's exercise where bug bounties ranging from $150 to $10,000 are up for grabs.

Running from September 30 to October 21, the bug bounty programme would include systems that belonged to the ministry as well as the Singapore Armed Forces and other agencies in the defence sector, Mindef said in a [statement](https://www.gov.sg/resources/sgpc/media_releases/mindef/press_release/P-20190927-1). The exercise this year also would have stronger focus on personal data protection, with additional bounties to be awarded for vulnerabilities that could result in the loss of personal data, the ministry said. 

Compared to this year's 11 systems, eight systems were points of target in the ministry's first bounty programme last year. 

Amongst the 400 hackers participating in the second bounty programme, 200 are based in Singapore--which is twice the number [in 2018](https://www.zdnet.com/article/singapore-defence-ministry-invites-hackers-to-breach-its-systems/) where 264 hackers took part. 

According to HackerOne, 35 bugs were identified--and resolved--in Mindef's bug bounty programme last year, with a total bounty of $14,750 dished out to participants. Citing its [ 2019 Hacker-Powered Security Report](https://click.pg.mlsend.com/link/c/YT0xMjU2MDY3MjIwMzkyMzgxMjU1JmM9YjVvOCZlPTE5MjgmYj0yODA3MTAyNTQmZD1xN2c0ajV6.jZY5PcTTGNd0lpEIm2tKy27ge_YTzulv53yQ8ujACiA), the bug bounty platform said organisations in Singapore, including the National University of Singapore and [GovTech](https://www.zdnet.com/article/singapore-government-to-run-another-bug-bounty/), also ran bounty programmes and awarded hackers more than $270,000--the highest amount in the Asia-Pacific region.

Mindef's programme manager at HackerOne, Fifi Handayani, said: "We want to applaud Mindef for being one of the first few government agencies to embrace such a forward-thinking approach to security. \[Its\] continued investment in hacker-powered security exemplifies the value governments and companies see from partnering with the hacker community to reduce risks." 

Singapore's defence sector in February unveiled plans to [arm itself with 300 specialists trained in cybersecurity](https://www.zdnet.com/article/singapore-arms-up-on-cyberdefence-experts-opens-cyberdefence-school/) skills as part of efforts to better safeguard its systems and networks. It also opened a school to prepare future recruits with relevant skillsets in cyberdefence. The new hires would carry out various tasks such as cyber incident responses, vulnerability assessments, as well as being responsible for operations planning and policy formulation, among others.
