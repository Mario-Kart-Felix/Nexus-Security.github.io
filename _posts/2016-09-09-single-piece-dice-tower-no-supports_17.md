[Dice Tower, single piece, no supports required](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3433643)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> This dice tower doesn’t require any supports and can be printed in a single piece.  
> 75% scale is enough for most dices, although you can experience some issues with d20.  
> 85% is enough for all dice sets  
> If you want to modify something, you can find SCAD sources here: [https://github.com/hirthwork/dice-tower.scad](https://github.com/hirthwork/dice-tower.scad)
> 
> Please, keep in mind that this dice tower requires a lot of filament. 85% scale model with 10% infill requires 330g of ABS plastic without skirt and brim. It will be quite frustrating to found that you out of plastic after 48 hours of printing

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!

The [Adafruit Learning System](http://learn.adafruit.com) has dozens of great tools to get you well on your way to creating incredible works of engineering, interactive art, and design with your 3D printer! If you’ve made a cool project that combines 3D printing and electronics, be sure to let us know, and we’ll [feature](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) it here!
