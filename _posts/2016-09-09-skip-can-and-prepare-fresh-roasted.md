If baking is your thing, you’ve probably created some delicious treats with pumpkin puree. But did you know it’s super-easy to roast and puree a sugar pumpkin at home? We’ll teach you how!

If you usually use canned pumpkin instead of roasting one, we understand. Canned pumpkin is more convenient—especially if you don’t have a lot of time.

However, when you have some time to create some beautiful maple pumpkin bread pudding or pumpkin chocolate chip cookies, we’ve got you covered.

Let’s go step-by-step through the process of roasting and pureeing your own pumpkin.

Canned vs. Roasted

So, what’s the difference between canned pumpkin and fresh pumpkin? Like most canned versus fresh debates, there are many dissimilarities, in color, texture, and, of course, taste. Let’s break it down.

You’ll immediately notice a difference in color and texture. Canned pumpkin is a much darker, deeper shade of orange, while the fresh pureed pumpkin is a subtle orange-yellow.

Fresh pumpkin has a brighter, earthier appeal, no additives to alter the taste, and a soft, creamy texture. Canned pumpkin has a much deeper flavor (which stands out in recipes), and a heavy, thick consistency.

So, whether you decide to use the convenient canned product, or spend some time roasting and pureeing your own, the choice is yours.
