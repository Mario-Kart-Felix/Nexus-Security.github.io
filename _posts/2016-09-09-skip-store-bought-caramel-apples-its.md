How to Make Caramel Apples
--------------------------

Making caramel apples is a fun fall tradition in many homes, but if you have yet to try it, we’ll walk you through the steps. From preparing your apples to choosing tasty Halloween toppings, we’ve got something yummy for you to try.

Making caramel apples isn’t a supply heavy task, but you do need a few things:

*   **A candy thermometer:** Depending on which recipe you choose, you may need [a candy thermometer](https://www.amazon.com/Escali-AHC1-Listed-Thermometer-Silver/dp/B01CI50FJU/?tag=lifesavvysite-20) to ensure your caramel sauce is at the right temperature.
*   **Lollipop or Popsicle sticks:** You’ll need to pierce your apples after removing the stem to create a handle for this sweet treat. Sturdy skewers, chopsticks, or sticks from outside also do the trick. If you want your apples to look as professional as possible, you can always buy [stout bamboo skewers made specifically for the task](https://www.amazon.com/BambooMN-Caramel-Garden-Bamboo-Skewers/dp/B0047PCP1G/?tag=lifesavvysite-20).

Supplies in hand, you’re ready to prep!

Wash your apples thoroughly to remove all the wax from the skin and then dry your apples completely before dipping. Cortland, Empire, and Granny Smith apples are all popular for this yummy snack.

Remove the stems and use a Popsicle stick, lollipop stick, or skewer to pierce through the apple as a way to hold your delicious treat. You’ll want to pierce through the section of the apple where you just removed the stem.

Place a piece of parchment paper on a large cookie sheet. Using room temperature butter, generously grease your parchment paper. The butter will help keep the caramel apples from sticking after being placed on the parchment paper.
