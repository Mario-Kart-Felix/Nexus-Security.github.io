##### Collaborate

### Collaborate in real time. Comment to share ideas.

Slab's WYSIWYG editor is easy to use. If you've used Google Docs, you already know how to use Slab. And unlike other wikis, Slab has real-time collaboration. That means you never overwrite work — even if two people click "Save" at the same time.
