Team communications are an essential part of any enterprise and with Email being more about messages from machines rather than people, the entire outlook in this regard has to be reconstructed. Email, during its prime, was all about messages from people at work and family. Now our inboxes are cluttered with automated emails, newsletters, and social media updates. That’s why using Emails for team communications might not always yield better productivity and there are by far better solutions to this whole issue.  

Slack, launched in 2013 by the founder of Flickr, is one of the most widely talked about and used team communications app right now. Slack offers a better and easy way to communicate internally with your team and features a better search API that lets you search whole conversations based on context. Integration with many third-party applications like Google Docs, Dropbox, GitHub, ZenDesk and more is another one of the key features that Slack has to offer.  

### Why The Need for Slack Alternative?

  

While there are many upsides to Slack, it is not flawless. For example, while Slack offers a great free plan, it limits the context searching feature by doing away with the logs after it reaches 10,000 messages. It might also be the case that Slack doesn’t fit your team because of the work you do. And some users might find its premium pricing a bit costly. The truth is that no single team communications app can satisfy the needs of all the consumers and that’s why there’s a need for its alternatives.  

10 Best Slack Alternatives for Team communication
-------------------------------------------------

  

Well, if you are one such enterprise looking to make the jump from Emails to a new platform for your Team Communications, here are the 10 Best Slack Alternatives that you can check out in 2019.  

1\. Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet
-----------------------------------

  

Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet are the new team conversation tools that are replacing “Google Hangouts” for G Suite consumers. While Google hasn’t had a good history with messaging apps, when it comes to team communications, its offering is quite solid. The best part about Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet is that they are **free to use if you are a G Suite customer**. And, if you are running a business, there’s a high chance that you are already using G Suite as the primary email provider. That means you will be able to use these excellent communication tools for free.  

Hangouts Chat is for written team communications where team members can message each other to converse, just like they can do on Slack. Since Hangouts Chat seamlessly connects with other Google services, you can **easily share files using Google Drive, work and collaborate on Google Docs, Sheets, or Slides, and use Google’s powerful search** for finding shared files, past messages, and more. If you need to have a face to face conversation, then you can use Hangouts Meet to start a team video call. This is a boon for teams that work remotely. Once you consider all its features and essentially free price, you get a communications suite that can easily replace Slack for you.

7\. Mattermost
--------------

  

One of the biggest problems with Slack is that it doesn’t offer any way to host it on your own company’s server. That might be a deal-breaker for many companies who deal with sensitive data and want to keep everything in-house. Well, if that’s what you or your business requires then you should check out Mattermost. It is an **open-source communication tool for businesses that want to run it on their private servers**. This allows companies to keep full ownership of their data and protect it behind their firewall and VPN. It even supports TLS encryption using AES-256 with 2048-bit RSA, so your data is truly protected.  

Talking about its communications features, Mattermost brings everything that you can expect from such a tool including messages for teams and channels, fully searchable message history, voice and video calls, screen sharing, and more. I also love that it offers a highly customizable notifications system that allows you to set up custom notifications for desktop and mobile applications. Another area where Mattermost shines is in helping DevOps team communicate. It **brings a full DevOps integration set along with support for things like incoming and outgoing webhooks,** custom slash commands, plugins and extensions, and much more.
