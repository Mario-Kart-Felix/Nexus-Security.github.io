> It was my old thought of making some gadgets of super hero’s like Ironman. After analyzing the Avnet smartEdge device and [brainium cloud](https://spa.brainium.com/login), got some idea to make such kind of wearable gloves. Controlling devices in gesture manner.
> 
> I received the Avnet kit, the 1st thing I explored about the branium cloud and basic features. I have done very basic level project its [here](https://www.hackster.io/asokfair/ai-smart-draw-with-brainium-iot-cloud-50ae12).
> 
> Followed by my basic demo, I started this project activity. I listed out the motions required in my project. Then with AI studio I reordered many motions and created modules. Started testing with mobile app initially. Then later I started using brainium app in raspberry pi.
