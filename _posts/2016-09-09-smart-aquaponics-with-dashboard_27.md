> Farm indoor or outdoor, in very less space, with more growth and less water usage. Also, monitor the conditions on a cloud-based dashboard.
> 
> The system consists of two tubs. The tub in the bottom would have water and fishes in it. The tub at the top would have plants in it. Plants can either planted into pots or planted directly into the tub at the top. Care should be taken that thereâ€™s gravel placed below the sand so that the sand does not seep in through the holes in the pot or the tub, with the excess water flowing out of the tub or the pots and enter the fish tank.
