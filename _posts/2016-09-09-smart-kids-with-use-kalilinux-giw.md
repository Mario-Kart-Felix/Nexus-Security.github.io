UK police deny responsibility for poster urging parents to report kids for using Kali Linux – [ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/uk-police-distance-themselves-from-poster-warning-parents-to-report-kids-for-using-kali-linux/). Poster found via [Twtter](https://twitter.com/G_IW/status/1227700420178567170). Might not be real, if a kid is doing all this, they’re a smart kid, [Kali seems to agree](https://twitter.com/kalilinux/status/1227703199584395267).
