As weird as Washington D.C. is, the Smithsonian endures as a great place to put American history into physical context. If you can’t make it there, the Smithsonian has released images from its collection. Images include portraits of [Ida B. Wells](https://npg.si.edu/object/npg_NPG.2009.36) to images of Amelia Earhart’s [Lockheed Vega 5B](https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/lockheed-vega-5b-amelia-earhart), and models of the [Cassiopeia A supernova remnant](https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2013/casa/).

> Welcome to Smithsonian Open Access, where you can download, share, and reuse millions of the Smithsonian’s images—right now, without asking. With new platforms and tools, you have easier access to nearly 3 million 2D and 3D digital items from our collections—with many more to come. This includes images and data from across the Smithsonian’s 19 museums, nine research centers, libraries, archives, and the National Zoo.
