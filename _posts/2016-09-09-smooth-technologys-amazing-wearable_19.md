Adafruit is a great place to work. A lot of amazing people work here, and have worked here, and will work here in the future. One is [Anamanaguchi](https://anamanaguchi.com/)‘s James DeVito. Noawadays, James and his teammates at Smooth Technology design excellent, wild, wearable designs that produce GIF-worthy moments at the major pop cultural events like the Grammy Awards. Here’s an article on Smooth Technology from [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21122742/billy-porter-hat-grammys-2020-interview-smooth-technology):

> There are no rules on “Freaky Friday” at [Smooth Technology’s](https://smooth.technology/projects/)Brooklyn studio. Accompanied by a robot bartender that, through facial recognition software, remembers your drink preference, a light-up demon babydoll, and a boatload of tools, the team gathers to spitball ideas. The wilder the better. And while freedom to explore the freaky is chicken soup for the innovator’s soul, it’s “Meticulous Monday” that keeps the team grounded in their fast-paced and pioneering ventures.

> Smooth Technology designed the mechanics behind Taylor Swift’s LED costume on her _1989_ World Tour, Janelle Monáe’s blinking eye Met Gala dress, and Billy Porter’s opening-and-closing motorized fringe hat at the Grammy Awards that set the internet ablaze. In addition to electronic livery for pop culture icons, Smooth Technology creates interactive exhibits that push the boundaries of motion and lighting, inviting its audiences to engage with tech in unfamiliar ways.
