> This is a 1/4 size version of my [previous Minecraft Jack O’Lantern](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:488574), now with integrated LED and CR2032 battery and 3d printed button controls. And best yet, it prints WITHOUT SUPPORT!
> 
> You can print either with a hole in the stump, or without, and you’re probably going to want to print one of my [Flame LED Diffusers](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3120235) as well.
> 
> The [LEDs](http://amzn.com/B0785G1SBP) I’m using have an integrated candle flicker chip and 29mm long leads, so that they can be bent around and used as contacts for the battery.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
