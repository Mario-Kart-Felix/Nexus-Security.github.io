> Hello Guys,
> 
> do you have a Snapback what you want to hang? I made a bracket that uses little material and is quick and easy to assemble.
> 
> I have wanted to hang up my caps for a long time but only found things that cost me too much material and time, so I made one by myself.  
> It is very stable even if it doesnâ€™t look like it ![ðŸ™‚](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png)

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And donâ€™t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
