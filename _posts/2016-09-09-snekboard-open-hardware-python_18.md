[Snekboard – An open-hardware python microcontroller for LEGO](https://www.crowdsupply.com/keith-packard/snekboard), now on Crowd Supply, go back it!

> Learn, Teach, Experiment, and Play with Robots
> 
> Snekboard is an open hardware development board that’s designed to let you hook up to LEGO Power Functions\* motors and switches so you can build robots out of LEGO and control them with CircuitPython or the simpler Snek programming language.
> 
> Snekboard is 48 x 48 mm – the same size as 6 x 6 LEGO studs – so you can easily build a LEGO enclosure for the board and attach it to your creation. It is powered by a 3.7 V, 900 mAh single-cell Lithium Polymer (LiPo) battery that fits under the board and charges over USB while Snekboard is being programmed from the host.

[Back this project](https://www.crowdsupply.com/keith-packard/snekboard), [read the post](https://www.crowdsupply.com/keith-packard/snekboard/updates/crowdfunding-begins), [check out Keith’s site with Snek](https://keithp.com/snek/), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/keith_x11/with_replies?lang=en). The Snekboard is also on circuitpython.org ([and we took some photos](https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=35434449%40N08&view_all=1&text=snek) of the one Keith let us check out!).

We are a backer! And have covered [Keith’s work on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/?s=%40keith_x11).
