> I recently traveled Japan and after playing some arcades I knew that I had to get back to a bit of retro gaming and bought myself a SNES classic mini. For a unique gaming experience I just had to get myself a transparent game pad but those can’t be purchased. That’s why I made one my own by 3D scanning the stock grey controller, and than 3D printed it using transparent resin.  
> The scanning process required a reference frame that I made by brazing aluminum profiles together.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
