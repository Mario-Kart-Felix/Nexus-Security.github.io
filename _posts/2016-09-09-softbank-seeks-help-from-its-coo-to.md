(Reuters) - Japan's SoftBank Group Corp is seeking the help of its chief operating officer, Marcelo Claure, to turn around WeWork, Bloomberg reported https://bloom.bg/2mi8bNz on Friday. Claure, who is also the former chief executive of Sprint Corp and remains its executive chairman, has been asked by SoftBank Chief Masayoshi Son to take a "more hands-on role" at WeWork, according to the report, which cited people familiar with the matter. Claure will help WeWork's new leadership identify revenue and cost-saving opportunities, Bloomberg reported, adding that a decision on his exact role has not been made yet.
