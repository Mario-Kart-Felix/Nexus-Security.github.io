Air pumps help move the fingers of this glove using the Adafruit app. Shared by [france.bonde](https://www.instructables.com/member/france.bonde/) on [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/SoftGlove/):

> As the actuators inflate, the rectangles they have on their top push against each other, bending the associated fingers.
> 
> The motor that controls the inflation is a device called “FlowIO”. This device is able to inflate, to deflate and to create a vacuum. At this moment the device is using an Adafruit platform controlled by an app on my phone, but my aim is to associate it with another glove with flex-sensors on its fingers, so that the softglove’s movements would mirror the other’s ones.
