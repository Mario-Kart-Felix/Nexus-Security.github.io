**Sojobo - A Binary Analysis Framework**

  
_Sojobo_ is an [emulator](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Emulator "emulator") for the [B2R2](https://b2r2.org/ "B2R2") framework. It was created to easier the [analysis](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Analysis "analysis") of potentially malicious files. It is totally developed in .NET so you don't need to install or compile any other external libraries (the project is self contained).  
With _Sojobo_ you can:  

*   Emulate a (32 bit) PE binary
*   Inspect the memory of the emulated process
*   Read the process state
*   Display a disassembly of the executed code
*   Emulate functions in a managed language (C# || F#)

**Using Sojobo**  
_Sojobo_ is intended to be used as a framework to create [program analysis](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Program%20Analysis "program analysis") utilities. However, various [**sample utilities**](https://github.com/enkomio/Sojobo/tree/master/Src/Examples "A binary analysis framework (8)") were created in order to show how to use the framework in a profitable way.  
  
**Tengu**  
_Tengu_ is an utility which is based on _Sojobo_. It allows to emulate a given process and control the execution by providing a [debugger](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Debugger "debugger")like UI (in particular it was inspired by the windbg debugger).  
  
**Documentation**  
The project is fully documented in F# (cit.) :) Joking apart, I plan to write some blog posts related to how to use Sojobo. Below a list of the current posts:  

*   [Sojobo - Yet another binary analysis framework](https://antonioparata.blogspot.com/2019/05/sojobo-yet-another-binary-analysis.html "Sojobo - Yet another binary analysis framework")

You can also read the **[API documentation](https://github.com/enkomio/Sojobo/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md "API documentation")**.  
  
**Compile**  
In order to compile Sojobo you need .NET Core to be installed and Visual Studio. To compile just run **build.bat**.
