I’m a subscriber to [The Prepared newsletter](https://theprepared.org/newsletter) (and we are a biz sponsor of it), today they sent out how many subscribers they have and it reminded me to post our stats so folks can get an idea of how our newsletters are doing. Companies do not share this type of info, so we try to share this, as well as: # of orders, # of ADABOX subscribers, and other things with our community. Sharing information like this can help other companies, it’s hard to get accurate estimates of markets.

We have a “Weekly Featured Products Newsletter” that folks need to have an [adafruit.com account and specifically ask for it](https://www.adafruit.com/newsletter_settings), we make it as hard as possible to get that newsletter and nothing is sent by default. We do not spam, we do not have the giant site-take-over sign up for newsletter. We do not spam.

The other newsletters are at [adafruitdaily.com](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/) and not part of any adafruit.com account or store at all, we did this so it was clear you’d never be spammed or marketed to at all in any way. We make that super-duper clear.

> Note: Adafruit Daily is not connected to your Adafruit.com shopping account and experience.

> What is Adafruit Daily?  
> Welcome to Adafruit Daily. Choose what categories interest you, and let us know how often you would like to receive our daily tip emails. You can choose to either receive a tip every day, or get them all in one email every week and you can unsubscribe at any time.

> Adafruit Daily is not connected to your Adafruit.com shopping account and experience in any way whatsoever – why? We hate spam and we will never spam anyone, ever. Adafruit has been venture capital free (VC) from the start, we have no loans, no sponsors, no advertising. We are 100% supported by you, the customer & community. So when we decided to do a newsletter we wanted to make it super-clear, your information is private, will never be shared and it has nothing to do with with your purchases at Adafruit.

We currently have:

*   Electronics
*   Python for Microcontrollers
*   Maker Business
*   New Products at Adafruit
*   3D Printing
*   Biohacking
*   Wearables/Cosplay
*   Internet of Things Monthly
*   MakeCode

MakeCode and Internet of Things Monthly being the newest most recent ones and are moving fast.

And here are all the stats for all the newsletters.

Python for microcontrollers has an unusually high # of subs for the topic it is, however over the last 2 years with the big trend(s) with python on hardware, frequent news, hardware, and large community, that’s where it is.
