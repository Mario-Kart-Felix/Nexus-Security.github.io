@sommersoft, Adabot’s community mechanic, wrote not one but two gists for #CircuitPython2020. [The first](https://gist.github.com/sommersoft/5cf89098fa8a657bdd45a7f5fd4bf0ac) covers what he’d like to see for CircuitPython in 2020 and [the second](https://gist.github.com/sommersoft/efd7bea541c33655c836b910184407fe) is a retrospective on 2019. They cover the what it takes to scale a project to hundreds of repos and many contributors.

Here is a spoiler from the retrospective:

> As a self-taught hobbyist, with no professional experience “in the industry”, I can hardly believe that I’ve been a contributing community member for 2 years now. The amount I’ve learned this year alone, is equally surprising to me. It may seem like lip service or puffery, but please take the following with heart-felt gravity: this community is special. Having this space that allows me to experiment, learn, expand, and stumble while offering nothing short of positive inspiration has been amazing. **I thank each and everyone of you!**
