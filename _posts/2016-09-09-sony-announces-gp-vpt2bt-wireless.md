[Sony](https://beebom.com/tag/sony/) now offers a shooting grip with a wireless remote commander that connects to the camera through Bluetooth. The grip is codenamed GP-VPT2BT and is targeted at vloggers, photographers, and filmmakers.  

With the new grip, Sony camera owners will be capable of performing all the major tasks such as taking pictures, videos, and zooming in. Creators can seamlessly switch from normal mode to self-shooting mode and also adjust the vertical angle, thanks to the tilt feature.  

Sony promises that the **grip would provide dust and moisture resistance**. While the Japanese camera giant says that the grip would offer “optimum stability”, **don’t expect stabilization anywhere close to a [gimbal](https://beebom.com/best-gimbals-for-iphone-11-11-pro-11-pro-max/)**.  

The company has equipped an adjustment wheel so that you can fit cameras of different sizes and weights to the grip. The grip has a flip button, indicator light, and lock switch. It **can even be used as a tripod** by expanding the bottom portion.
