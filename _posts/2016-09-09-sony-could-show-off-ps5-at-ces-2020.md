In merely a week’s time, we will be knee-deep in [new smart TVs](https://beebom.com/samsung-symphony-tvs-premium-audio-unveiled-ces-2020/), [soundbars](https://beebom.com/lgs-2020-soundbar-ai-room-calibration/), artificial intelligence, or [smartphone announcements](https://beebom.com/vivo-launch-folding-smartphone-mwc-2020/). They sure sound exciting but Sony might be able to pull the biggest crowd at CES 2020 this year. You ask, why? Sony is rumored to [unveil Xperia 3](https://beebom.com/sony-xperia-flagships-mid-rangers-2020-lineup-rumoured/) at the trade show, but there’s a chance that Sony will give us a first glimpse at the [PlayStation 5](https://beebom.com/playstation-5-name-release-date-confirmed/).  

Earlier this year, Sony [confirmed its plans](https://beebom.com/playstation-5-name-release-date-confirmed/) to launch the PS5 during the holidays next year and make us wait an entire year to know what the company’s next major gaming console will offer. Microsoft, a few weeks later, one-upped its arch-nemesis and surprised us all by [showing off its next-gen Xbox Series X console](https://beebom.com/xbox-series-x-revealed/). Now, it looks like Sony doesn’t want to be left behind and is going to treat users with some juicy PS5 announcements at [CES 2020](https://beebom.com/tag/ces-2020/).  

Sony recently updated its official website to add a dedicated CES 2020 landing page. It highlights that _“The future is coming”_ and we cannot help but think that it’s a hint about the PS5. I know, the company is rumored to do the [complete PS5 unveil](https://beebom.com/playstation-5-base-model-2tb-ssd-price/) at E3 next year, but the company could opt for an early 2020 first look to keep the enthusiasts hooked in.  

On its dedicated CES 2020 landing page, Sony says that it’s _“unveiling a unique vision of the future, bringing creativity and technology together like never before, to unleash new sensations and emotions.”_  

The company’s CES events have little to nothing to do with its PlayStation portfolio — at least that has been the case to date. But since everyone is eager for the PS5 unveiling, I expect Sony to deliver on this hope next week. Sony’s CES 2020 event is scheduled for 5 PM PST on 6th January (6:30 am IST on 7th January) and it will be live-streamed. We will bring you on-ground live coverage from the show floor, so don’t forget to return for more information.
