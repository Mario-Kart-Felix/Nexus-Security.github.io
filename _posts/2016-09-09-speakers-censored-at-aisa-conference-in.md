Speakers Censored at AISA Conference in Melbourne
-------------------------------------------------

Two speakers were censored at the Australian Information Security Association's [annual conference](https://cyberconference.com.au/) this week in Melbourne. [Thomas Drake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_A._Drake), former NSA employee and whistleblower, was scheduled to give a talk on the golden age of surveillance, both government and corporate. [Suelette Dreyfus](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/people/suelette), lecturer at the University of Melbourne, was scheduled to give a talk on her work -- funded by the EU government -- on anonymous whistleblowing technologies like Dropbox and how they reduce corruption in countries where that is a problem.

Both were put on the program months ago. But just before the event, the Australian government's ACSC (the Australian Cyber Security Centre) demanded they both be removed from the program.

It's really kind of stupid. Australia has been benefiting a lot from whistleblowers in recent years -- exposing corruption and bad behavior on the part of the government -- and the government doesn't like it. It's cracking down on the whistleblowers and reporters who write their stories. My guess is that someone high up in ACSC saw the word "whistleblower" in the descriptions of those two speakers and talks and panicked.

You can read details of their talks, including abstracts and slides, [here](https://censorcon.net/). Of course, now [everyone](https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2019-10-08/us-whistleblower-speech-cancelled-at-cybersecurity-conference/11581986) [is](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3444596/speaker-disinvites-at-cybercon-spark-controversy.html) [writing](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/08/us-whistleblower-thomas-drake-says-speech-was-cancelled-due-to-government-pressure) about the story. The two censored speakers spent a lot of the day yesterday on the phone with reporters, and they have a bunch of TV and radio interviews today.

I am at this conference, speaking on Wednesday morning (today in Australia, as I write this). ACSC used to have its own government cybersecurity conference. This is the first year it combined with AISA. I hope it's the last. And that AISA invites the two speakers back next year to give their censored talks.
