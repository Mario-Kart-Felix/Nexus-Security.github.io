HP has announced an updated version of its Spectre x360 13 convertible with upgraded hardware, improved connectivity and better battery life. The device comes with the same sleek design of its predecessor, but is a much more powerful beast, courtesy Intel’s 10th-gen Core series [‘Ice Lake’ processors](https://beebom.com/intel-10th-gen-laptop-processors-ice-lake/) paired with up to 16GB of RAM and 2TB of PCIe SSD storage.  

HP Spectre x360 Features and Specifications
-------------------------------------------

  

The HP Spectre x360 features a 13.3-inch 4K (3840 x 2160 pixels) AMOLED display protected by Corning Gorilla Glass NBT. While the base model comes with a standard OLED screen, the higher-end version will also be offered with an anti-reflective panel with the same specifications. Both will be powered by Intel’s 10th-gen Core processors, but while the base version will come with the Core i5-1035G1, the more expensive offering will have the Core i7-1065G7 under the hood.  

Alongside the high-powered processors, the device will offer up to 16GB of RAM and 2TB of PCIe SSD storage, as mentioned already.
