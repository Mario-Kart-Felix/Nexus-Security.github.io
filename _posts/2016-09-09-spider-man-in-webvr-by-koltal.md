Here’s an open-source fan made Spider-Man virtual reality experience based on WebVR ([video](https://youtu.be/QHf2Ge7QXEA)), made by [@koltal](https://twitter.com/koltal/with_replies) works best with a VR headset like Oculus Quest. If you have a VR headset with a browser like the Oculus Quest, visit: [https://spiderman.webvr.link/](https://spiderman.webvr.link/) The [source code is here](https://github.com/talkol/spiderman), it was made with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/), a web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences. The video above was captured via an Oculus Quest casting to a [Google Chromecast Ultra](https://store.google.com/us/product/chromecast_ultra) to [HDMI to USB Capture](http://www.magewell.com/products/usb-capture-hdmi-plus) to [Wirecast](https://www.telestream.net/wirecast/). I needed to use a [HDMI splitter](https://www.amazon.com/HD-102-Powered-Splitter-Certified-Support/dp/B005HXFARS) for whatever reason to get the Chromecast to work with the USB Capture in WireCast.
