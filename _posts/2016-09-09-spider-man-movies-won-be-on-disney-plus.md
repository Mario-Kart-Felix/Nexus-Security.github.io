[Disney+](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-plus-star-wars-han-shoots-first-scene-chang/1100-6471369/) offers a wide variety of movies and shows from Disney's catalog, including loads from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. One notable omission, though, is the popular character Spider-Man. And sure enough, the wallcrawler won't be joining the streaming service, as Disney+ head of content and marketing Ricky Strauss says the company has no plans to pursue it.

"We love our friends at Sony, but we don’t have any plans to have the live-action Spider-Man movies on Disney+” Strauss told [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20956671/disney-plus-marvel-spider-man-tom-holland-avengers-endgame-netflix-fox-xmen). "We will have all the Spider-Man animated shows that we did so they'll be on there under the Marvel banner. But who knows what can happen in the future?"

The two Spider-Man films, Homecoming and Far From Home, represent a relatively large hole in the MCU. Aside from being one of Marvel's most popular characters, Homecoming builds Spidey's relationship with Tony Stark (aka Iron Man) that becomes a key emotional beat in Infinity War and Endgame. Far From Home served as an epilogue to Endgame, showing how characters in the Marvel universe move on after those massive events.

At the same time, it's unsurprising. Sony owns the film rights to Spider-Man films, and Marvel had to broker a deal to use the character in the first place. Earlier this year that deal appeared in jeopardy for future films, but was [saved for a third movie](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-rejoins-the-mcu-sony-and-marvel-strike-/1100-6470154/)\--with a little [personal advocacy from actor Tom Holland](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-boss-explains-how-tom-holland-saved-spider-/1100-6470345/).

Strauss does note that there is Spider-Man content on the service. Disney+ even has a [dedicated Spider-Man section](https://www.disneyplus.com/franchise/spider-man) that can be found in its Search page. That includes animated Spider-Man shows from various eras, including the 1990s Spider-Man animated series, the team-up Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends, and the Ultimate Spider-Man series in 2011.
