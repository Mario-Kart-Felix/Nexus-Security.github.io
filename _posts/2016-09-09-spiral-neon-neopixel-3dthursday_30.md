> I created this simple spiral holder for the [Flexible Silicone Neon-like Skinny NeoPixel LED Strip](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4310) by adafruit. It’s just the right size to coil 1 meter of strip. A simple retention clip keeps hold of the LEDs without obscuring them.

> I printed at .25mm layer height with some black PLA. The clips overhang by 45 degrees, so should be printable without support on most printers. Then, simply coil the strip and gently press into the clips. Pay attention to which end you leave at the outside!

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
