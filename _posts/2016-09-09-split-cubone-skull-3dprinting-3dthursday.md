> Because I dont like supports or sanding Ive slit this beautiful skull in half and added pin holes. You will have to mirror the opposite half and the pin holes are small so you can drill them to the pin sie you have on hand.  
> Its all so smaller then the original longest side approx. 75 mm
> 
> !!! the images are there but just not showing up, its been days !!!

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
