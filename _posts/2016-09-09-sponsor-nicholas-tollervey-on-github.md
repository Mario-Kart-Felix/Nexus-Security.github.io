> I develop software that helps folks learn the skills and knowledge they need to imagine, develop and program the stuff they want. In addition to writing software, I spend a lot of time researching and thinking about how folks learn, use and create with code.
> 
> Examples of my work include the [Mu code editor](https://codewith.mu/) (aimed at beginner programmers and educators), various MicroPython related tools for easily working with embedded / microcontroller based systems, and [PyperCard](https://pypercard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (a simple cross platform GUI toolkit for beginners, based upon HyperCard concepts and written in Python).
> 
> These are exercises in digital emancipation, exploration and education.  
> I value simplicity, compassion, openness, collaboration and fun.
