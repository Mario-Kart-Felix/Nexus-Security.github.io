Spotify Launches The Decade Wrapped Podcast
-------------------------------------------

Spotify’s new 10-episode series is called The Decade Wrapped, and it takes a journey through the 2010s via the music that helped shape them. This original podcast from Spotify revisits “the music stories that defined pop culture between 2010 and 2019.”

Spotify revealed The Decade Wrapped in a post on [For the Record](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-12-16/revisit-the-biggest-songs-artists-and-cultural-moments-of-the-last-10-years-with-spotifys-the-decade-wrapped-podcast/). The podcast is hosted by Eric Eddings, who is joined by “critics, comedians, influencers, and writers”. With their help, Eddings takes a deep dive into the stories behind the shifts in music.

Each episode looks at a single year in the decade, analyzing the big shifts in music that occurred that year. The first three episodes are available right now, with the rest of the episodes being released over the course of the next week.

The first episode is all about “female-driven pop” such as Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift, with Nicki Minaj taking the starring role. The second episode is focused on One Direction, whose first album and tour inspired a generation of internet-literate youngsters.
