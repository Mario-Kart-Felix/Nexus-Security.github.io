Your Favorite Artists Don’t Write Their Own Songs
-------------------------------------------------

You may be surprised to learn that your favorite artists probably don’t write their own songs. This is especially true of popstars, who usually employ teams of songwriters to write hits for them. And these songwriters rarely get the recognition they deserve.

However, things are slowly changing, and streaming music services are part of that change. Spotify has been publicly displaying song credits since 2018. And now, Spotify has launched songwriter pages which gives songwriters their own public profiles.

Spotify Launches Public Profiles for Songwriters
------------------------------------------------

Spotify announced songwriter pages in a post on [Spotify for Artists](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/songwriter-pages). It’s being launched in beta, with a limited number of high-profile songwriters involved from the beginning. These include Meghan Trainor, Fraser T. Smith, Teddy Geiger, and Justin Tranter.

These initial profiles have been created in collaboration between Spotify, the songwriters in question, and music publishers. However, Spotify is openly inviting other songwriters to express an interest in gaining a public profile on the streaming service.

Songwriter pages make it easier for you to get to know particular songwriters and discover what songs they have written. All you need to do is click the three dots next to a track, and select **Song Credits**. You can then click on the name of one of the songwriters.

You’ll see all of the songs they have written and the artists they’ve collaborated with. You can also click the **Listen on Spotify** button to open a playlist full of the songs they’ve written or co-written. Potentially allowing you to discover new music.

Timeless Ways to Discover New Music to Stream
