With Tormach and Haas capturing a lot of the entry-level professional market for CNC machines, we don’t see too many CNC conversions of manual mills anymore. And so [this power drawbar conversion for a Precision Matthews mill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HjaMnmtYbg) really caught our eye.

What’s that, you say? Didn’t \[Physics Anonymous\] already build a power drawbar for a mill? [They did](https://hackaday.com/2018/09/03/air-wrench-becomes-a-milling-machine-power-drawbar/), and it was quite successful. But that was based on a pneumatic impact wrench, and while it worked fine on a manual mill, the same approach would be a bit slow and cumbersome on a CNC mill. For this build, they chose a completely different approach to providing the necessary upward force to draw the collet into the collet holder and clamp down on the tool: springs. Specifically, [Belleville spring washers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belleville_washer), which are shaped like shallow cups and can exert tremendous axial force over a very short distance.

\[PA\] calculated that they’d need to exert 2,700 pounds (12,000 Newtons) of force over a length of a couple of inches, which seems outside the Belleville washer’s specs. Luckily, the springs can be stacked, either nested together in “series” to increase the load force, or alternating in “parallel” to apply the rated force over a greater distance. To compress their stack, they used a nifty multi-stage pneumatic cylinder to squash down the springs and release the collet. They also had to come up with a mechanism to engage to machine’s spindle only when a tool change is called for. The video below details the design and shows the build; skip to 11:32 to see the drawbar in action.

We’re looking forward to the rest of \[Physics Anonymous\]’ conversion. They’re no strangers to modifying off-the-shelf machines to do their bidding, after all – witness [their improvements to an SLA printer](https://hackaday.com/2019/02/18/entry-level-sla-printer-gets-upgrades-prints-better/).
