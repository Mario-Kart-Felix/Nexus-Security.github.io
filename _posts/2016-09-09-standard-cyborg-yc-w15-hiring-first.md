### About Standard Cyborg

Standard Cyborg is building the platform for computer vision (CV). We create the cloud and edge tools developers and non-developers need to build, deploy, and improve CV solutions quickly. We multiply the potential of the real world by making computer vision accessible to all.

Our customers use our tools to power a broad range of applications. These teams use our SDK, associated ML models, and platform tools to capture, analyze, and organize 2D/3D scenes. Including:

*   generate 3D assets for AR/VR training for manufacturing
*   measure faces for eyewear customization and [glasses sizing](https://medium.com/standard-cyborg/announcing-the-launch-of-focals-showroom-powered-by-standard-cyborg-939e32cae21f)
*   quantify foot shape for shoe sizing and insole customization
*   enable users to generate models for custom breast prostheses post-mastectomy _at home_
*   ... and many more using our consumer demo app, [Capture](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/capture-3d-scan-anything/id1444183458), the most popular 3D scanning app

### Our Culture

We value originality in thought and humility in our convictions.

We’re endlessly curious and tenacious in our effort to make the complex field of computer vision approachable, humane, and easy to deploy for our customers.

We believe that great product design with high quality tooling, documentation, and examples are the best way to achieve that.

We are pragmatic, not dogmatic. No ideas are taken personally, and all ideas are open to discussion.

*   Strive to solve problems that make a real impact for our customers
*   Care deeply about the quality of what you build and hold yourself to intrinsic standards
*   Strong communication skills, verbal and written, in order to easily communicate across functions
