Polish science fiction author, futurologist

Not to be confused with

[Stanislaw Ulam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislaw_Ulam "Stanislaw Ulam")

, a Polish-American mathematician and atomic weapons researcher.

**Stanisław Herman[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-Zaglada-2) Lem** (Polish: [\[staˈɲiswaf ˈlɛm\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Polish "Help:IPA/Polish") ([![About this sound](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg/11px-Loudspeaker.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pl-Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem.ogg "About this sound")[listen](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Pl-Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem.ogg "Pl-Stanisław Lem.ogg")); 12 or 13 September 1921 – 27 March 2006) was a Polish writer of [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction"), [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), and [satire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire "Satire"), and a trained [physician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician "Physician"). Lem's books have been translated into 41 languages and have sold over 45 million copies.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-41/27-3)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-zeit2005-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-5) From the 1950s to 2000s, he published many books, both science fiction and philosophical/[futurological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurology "Futurology"). He is best known as the author of the 1961 novel _[Solaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(novel) "Solaris (novel)")_, which has been made into a [feature film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(novel)#Cinema "Solaris (novel)") three times. In 1976, [Theodore Sturgeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Sturgeon "Theodore Sturgeon") wrote that Lem was the most widely read science fiction writer in the world.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-Strugatsky-6)

Lem's works explore philosophical themes through speculation on [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology"), the nature of [intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence "Intelligence"), the impossibility of [communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication "Communication") with and understanding of [alien intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_intelligence "Alien intelligence"), despair about human limitations, and humanity's place in the universe. They are sometimes presented as [fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction "Fiction"), but others are in the form of [essays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essay "Essay") or philosophical books.

Translating his works is difficult due to passages with elaborate [word formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_formation "Word formation"), idiomatic wordplay, alien or robotic poetry, and puns.

Street in Lwów, where, according to his autobiography

_Wysoki zamek_

, Lem spent his childhood

Lem was born in 1921 in [Lwów](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lw%C3%B3w "Lwów"), [interwar Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Polish_Republic "Second Polish Republic") (now Lviv, [Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine "Ukraine")) to a family of Jewish origin. According to his own account, he was actually born on the 13th of September, but the date was changed to the 12th on his birth certificate [because of superstition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triskaidekaphobia "Triskaidekaphobia").[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-Orli%C5%84ski37-7) He was the son of Sabina [née](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#Name_at_birth "Given name") Woller (1892–1979) and Samuel Lem (1879–1954), a wealthy [laryngologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngology "Laryngology") and former [physician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician "Physician") in the [Austro-Hungarian Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Hungarian_Army "Austro-Hungarian Army"),[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-Jarz%C8%A9bski1986-8)[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9) and first cousin to Polish poet [Marian Hemar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_Hemar "Marian Hemar") (Lem's father's sister's son).[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-10) In later years Lem sometimes claimed to have been raised [Roman Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic"), but he went to Jewish religious lessons during his school years.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-Zaglada-2) He later became an [atheist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheist "Atheist") "for moral reasons ... the world appears to me to be put together in such a painful way that I prefer to believe that it was not created ... intentionally".[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-rc-11)[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-MisI-12) In later years he would call himself both an [agnostic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnostic "Agnostic")[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-SP-19960115-13) and an [atheist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheist "Atheist").[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-14)

After the [Soviet invasion and occupation of Eastern Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Poland "Soviet invasion of Poland"), he was not allowed to study at Lwow Polytechnic as he wished because of his "[bourgeois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie "Bourgeoisie") origin", and only due to his father's connections was accepted to study medicine at [Lwów University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Lviv "University of Lviv") in 1940.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-self-15) During the subsequent [Nazi occupation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_Poland_(1939%E2%80%9345) "Occupation of Poland (1939–45)") (1941–1944), Lem's family, which had Jewish roots, avoided imprisonment in a [ghetto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_ghetto "Nazi ghetto"), surviving with false papers.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9) He would later recall:[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9)[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-NY-16)

> During that period, I learned in a very personal, practical way that I was no "Aryan". I knew that my ancestors were Jews, but I knew nothing of the Mosaic faith and, regrettably, nothing at all of Jewish culture. So it was, strictly speaking, only the Nazi legislation that brought home to me the realization that I had Jewish blood in my veins.

During that time, Lem earned a living as a car mechanic and welder,[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9) and occasionally stole munitions from storehouses (to which he had access as an employee of a German company) to pass them on to the [Polish resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_resistance_movement_in_World_War_II "Polish resistance movement in World War II").[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-17)

In 1945, the Polish [Eastern Borderlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kresy "Kresy") were annexed into [Soviet Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Ukraine "Soviet Ukraine"), and the family, along with many other Poles, [was resettled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_population_transfers_(1944%E2%80%9346) "Polish population transfers (1944–46)") to [Kraków](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w "Kraków"), where Lem, at his father's insistence, took up medical studies at the [Jagiellonian University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagiellonian_University "Jagiellonian University").[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9) He did not take his final examinations on purpose, to avoid military service, obligatory for all medical graduates at the time.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-self-15) After receiving _absolutorium_ (Polish term for the evidence of completion of the studies without diploma), he did an obligatory monthly work at a hospital, at a [maternity ward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternity_ward "Maternity ward"), where he assisted at a number of [childbirths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth "Childbirth") and a [caesarean section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesarean_section "Caesarean section"). Lem said that the sight of blood was one of the reasons he decided to drop medicine. [\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-18)

### Rise to fame

Lem made his literary debut in 1946 with a number of works of different genres, including poetry as well as a [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") novel, _[The Man from Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_from_Mars "The Man from Mars")_ (_Człowiek z Marsa_), serialized in _[Nowy Świat Przygód](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nowy_%C5%9Awiat_Przyg%C3%B3d&action=edit&redlink=1 "Nowy Świat Przygód (page does not exist)") \[[pl](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowy_%C5%9Awiat_Przyg%C3%B3d "pl:Nowy Świat Przygód")\]_ (_New World of Adventures_).[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9) Between 1948 and 1950 Lem was working as a scientific research assistant at the [Jagiellonian University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagiellonian_University "Jagiellonian University"), and published a number of short stories, poems, reviews and similar works, particularly at _[Tygodnik Powszechny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tygodnik_Powszechny "Tygodnik Powszechny")_.[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-PWN-19) In 1951, he published his first book, _[The Astronauts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Astronauts "The Astronauts")_ (_Astronauci_).[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9) In 1953 he met and married ([civil marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_marriage "Civil marriage")) Barbara Leśniak, a medical student.[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-20) Their church marriage ceremony was performed in February, 1954.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9) In 1954, he published a short story anthology, _[Sesame and Other Stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sesame_and_Other_Stories&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sesame and Other Stories (page does not exist)")_ (_[Sezam i inne opowiadania](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sezam_i_inne_opowiadania&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sezam i inne opowiadania (page does not exist)") \[[pl](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sezam_i_inne_opowiadania "pl:Sezam i inne opowiadania")\]_).[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9) The following year, 1955, saw the publication of another science fiction novel, _[The Magellanic Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magellanic_Cloud "The Magellanic Cloud")_ (_Obłok Magellana_).[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9)

During the era of [Stalinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalinism_in_Poland "Stalinism in Poland"), which had begun in Poland in the late 1940s, all published works had to be directly approved by the [communist regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_regime "Communist regime"). Thus _Astronauci_ was not, in fact, the first novel Lem finished, just the first that made it past [the censors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_Poland "Censorship in the People's Republic of Poland").[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9) Going by the date of the finished manuscript, Lem's first book was a partly autobiographical novella _[Hospital of the Transfiguration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_of_the_Transfiguration "Hospital of the Transfiguration")_ (_Szpital Przemienienia_), finished in 1948.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9) It would be published seven years later, in 1955, as a [trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilogy "Trilogy") under the title _[Czas nieutracony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czas_nieutracony "Czas nieutracony")_ (_Time Not Lost_).[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9) The experience of trying to push _Czas nieutracony_ through the censors was one of the major reasons Lem decided to focus on the less-censored genre of science fiction.[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-PWN-19) Nonetheless, most of Lem's works published in the 1950s also contain—forced upon him by the censors and editors—various references to [socialist realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_realism "Socialist realism") as well as the "glorious future of communism".[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-PWN-19)[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-sfenc-21) Lem later criticized several of his early pieces as compromised by the ideological pressure.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9)

Lem became truly productive after 1956, when the [de-Stalinization period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khrushchev_Thaw "Khrushchev Thaw") in the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") led to the "[Polish October](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_October "Polish October")", when Poland experienced an increase in [freedom of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech "Freedom of speech").[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9)[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-PWN-19)[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-sfenc-21) Between 1956 and 1968, Lem authored seventeen books.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-sfenc-21) His writing over the next three decades or so was split between [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") (primarily prose) and essays about science and culture.[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-PWN-19)

In 1957, he published his first non-fiction, philosophical book, _[Dialogues](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dialogues_(Lem)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Dialogues (Lem) (page does not exist)")_ ([Dialogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dialogi&action=edit&redlink=1 "Dialogi (page does not exist)") \[[pl](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogi "pl:Dialogi")\]), as well as a science fiction anthology, _[The Star Diaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star_Diaries "The Star Diaries")_ (_Dzienniki gwiazdowe_),[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9) collecting short stories about one of his most popular characters, [Ijon Tichy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ijon_Tichy "Ijon Tichy").[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-Lem2000-22) 1959 saw the publication of three books: _Eden_, _Śledztwo_ and the short story anthology _Inwazja z Aldebarana_.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9) 1961 saw two more books, the first regarded as being among his top works: _Pamiętnik znaleziony w wannie_, _[Solaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(novel) "Solaris (novel)")_, as well as _Powrót z gwiazd_.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9) This was followed by a collection of his essays and non-fiction prose, _Wejście na orbitę_ (1962), and a short story anthology _Noc księżycowa_ (1963).[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9) In 1964, Lem published a large work on the border of philosophy and sociology of science and futurology, _[Summa Technologiae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summa_Technologiae "Summa Technologiae")_, as well as a novel, _[The Invincible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invincible "The Invincible")_ (_Niezwyciężony_).[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9)[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-sfenc-21)

Later in that decade, he published _Pokój na Ziemi_ (1984) and _Fiasko_ (1986), Lem's final science fiction novel.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9)

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Lem cautiously supported the Polish dissident movement, and started publishing essays in Paris-based _[Kultura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kultura "Kultura")_.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9) In 1982, with [martial law in Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law_in_Poland "Martial law in Poland") declared, Lem moved to [West Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Berlin "West Berlin"), where he became a fellow of the [Institute for Advanced Study, Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Advanced_Study,_Berlin "Institute for Advanced Study, Berlin") (_Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin_).[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9) After that, he settled in [Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna "Vienna"). He returned to Poland in 1988.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9)

### Final years

From the late 1980s onwards, he tended to concentrate on philosophical texts and essays, published in a number of Polish magazines (_[Tygodnik Powszechny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tygodnik_Powszechny "Tygodnik Powszechny")_, _[Odra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odra_(magazine) "Odra (magazine)")_, _[Przegląd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Przegl%C4%85d "Przegląd")_, and others).[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9)[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-PWN-19) They were later collected in a number of anthologies.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9)

In early 1980s literary critic and historian [Stanisław Bereś](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Bere%C5%9B "Stanisław Bereś") conducted a lengthy interview with Lem, which got published in book format in 1987 as _[Rozmowy ze Stanisławem Lemem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rozmowy_ze_Stanis%C5%82awem_Lemem "Rozmowy ze Stanisławem Lemem")_ (_Conversations with Stanisław Lem)_. That edition was subject to censorship. A revised, complete edition was published in 2002 as _Tako rzecze… Lem_ (_Thus spoke... Lem_).[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-23)

In the early 1990s, Lem met with the literary scholar and critic [Peter Swirski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Swirski "Peter Swirski") for a series of extensive interviews, published together with other critical materials and translations as _[A Stanislaw Lem Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Stanislaw_Lem_Reader "A Stanislaw Lem Reader")_ (1997); in the book, Lem speaks about a range of issues rarely touched on before in any interview. Moreover, the book includes Swirski's translation of Lem's retrospective essay "Thirty Years Later", devoted to Lem's nonfictional treatise _[Summa Technologiae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summa_Technologiae "Summa Technologiae")_. During later interviews in 2005, Lem expressed his disappointment with the genre of science fiction, and his general pessimism regarding technical progress. He viewed the human body as unsuitable for space travel, held that information technology drowns people in a glut of low-quality information, and considered truly intelligent robots as both undesirable and impossible to construct.[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-zeit-24) Subsequently, Peter Swirski has published a series of in-depth studies of Lem as a writer, philosopher, and futurologist; notable among them are the recent _From Literature to Biterature: Lem, Turing, Darwin_ (2013), _Stanislaw Lem: Selected Letters to Michael Kandel_ (2014), _Lemography_ (2014), and _Stanislaw Lem: Philosopher of the Future_ (2015).

Personal life
-------------

Lem was a [polyglot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyglot "Polyglot"): he knew Polish, Latin (from medical school), German, French, English, Russian and Ukrainian.[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-atpc-25)

Lem was married to Barbara Lem [née](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%A9e "Née") Krymska until his death. She died on 27 April 2016.[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-26) Their only son, Tomasz, was born in 1968. He studied physics and mathematics at the [University of Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Vienna "University of Vienna"), and graduated with a degree in physics from [Princeton University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University "Princeton University"). Tomasz wrote a memoir about his father, _Awantury na tle powszechnego ciążenia_ ("Tantrums on the Background of the Universal Gravitation"), which contain numerous personal details about Stanisław Lem. The annotation of the book says Tomasz works as a translator and has a daughter, Anna.[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-27)

Stanisław Lem died from heart disease in [Kraków](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w "Kraków") on 27 March 2006 at the age of 84.[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-PWN-19)

Relationship with American science fiction
------------------------------------------

Lem was awarded an honorary membership in the [Science Fiction Writers of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy_Writers_of_America "Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America") (SFWA) in 1973. SFWA Honorary membership is given to people who do not meet the publishing criteria for joining the regular membership, but who would be welcomed as members had their work appeared in the qualifying English-language publications. Lem, however, never had a high opinion of [American science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_science_fiction "American science fiction"), describing it as ill-thought-out, poorly written, and interested more in making money than in ideas or new literary forms.[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-faq.htm_sfwa-28) After his eventual American publication, when he became eligible for regular membership, his honorary membership was rescinded, an action that some of the SFWA members apparently intended as a rebuke,[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-depauw-29) and it seems that Lem interpreted it as such. Lem was invited to stay on with the organization with a regular membership, but declined.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-SFWA-30) After many members (including [Ursula K. Le Guin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin "Ursula K. Le Guin")) protested against Lem's treatment by the SFWA, a member offered to pay his dues. Lem never accepted the offer.[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-faq.htm_sfwa-28)[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-SFWA-30)

### Philip K. Dick

Lem singled out only one[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-visionary-31) American science fiction writer for praise, [Philip K. Dick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick "Philip K. Dick"), in a 1984 English-language anthology of his critical essays, _[Microworlds: Writings on Science Fiction and Fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microworlds:_Writings_on_Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy "Microworlds: Writings on Science Fiction and Fantasy")_. Lem had initially held a low opinion of Philip K. Dick (as he did for the bulk of American science fiction) and would later claim that this was due to a limited familiarity with Dick's work.

Dick, who had mental health problems, maintained that Stanisław Lem was probably a false name used by a composite committee operating on orders of the [Communist party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_party "Communist party") to gain control over public opinion, and wrote a letter to the [FBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI "FBI") to that effect.[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-mdavies-32) Lem was also responsible for the Polish translation of Dick's work _[Ubik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubik "Ubik")_ in 1972, and when Dick felt monetarily short-changed by the publisher, he held Lem personally responsible (see _[Microworlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microworlds:_Writings_on_Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy "Microworlds: Writings on Science Fiction and Fantasy")_).[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-english-33)[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-mdavies-32)

Shelf of books by (and one about) Stanisław Lem in nine different languages

Lem is one of the most highly acclaimed science fiction writers, hailed by critics as equal to such classic authors as [H. G. Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells "H. G. Wells") and [Olaf Stapledon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_Stapledon "Olaf Stapledon").[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-Times-34) In 1976, [Theodore Sturgeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Sturgeon "Theodore Sturgeon") wrote that Lem was the most widely read science fiction writer in the world.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-Strugatsky-6)

In Poland, in the 1960s and 1970s, Lem remained under the radar of mainstream critics, who dismissed him as a "mass market", low-brow, youth-oriented writer; such dismissal might have given him a form of invisibility from censorship.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9)

His works were widely translated abroad, appearing in over 40 languages, though the bulk of them were in [Eastern Bloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc "Eastern Bloc") countries (Poland, Germany, Hungary, former Czechoslovakia and the former Soviet Union).[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9)[Franz Rottensteiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Rottensteiner "Franz Rottensteiner"), Lem's former agent abroad, had this to say about Lem's reception on international markets:[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-Rottensteiner-35)

> With \[number of translations and copies sold\], Lem is the most successful author in modern Polish fiction; nevertheless his commercial success in the world is limited, and the bulk of his large editions was due to the special publishing conditions in the [Communist countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc "Eastern Bloc"): [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Poland_(1945%E2%80%9389) "History of Poland (1945–89)"), the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union"), and the [German Democratic Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Democratic_Republic "German Democratic Republic")). Only in [West Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany "West Germany") was Lem really a critical and a commercial success \[... and everywhere ...\] in recent years interest in him has waned.
> 
> But he is the only writer of European \[science fiction, most of whose\] books have been translated into English, and \[...\] kept in print in the USA. Lem's critical success in English is due mostly to the excellent translations of [Michael Kandel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kandel "Michael Kandel").

His best-known novels include _[Solaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(novel) "Solaris (novel)")_ (1961), _[His Master's Voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Master%27s_Voice_(novel) "His Master's Voice (novel)")_ (_Głos pana_, 1968), and the late _[Fiasco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiasco_(novel) "Fiasco (novel)")_ (_Fiasko_, 1987). _Solaris_ was made into [a film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(1968_film) "Solaris (1968 film)") in 1968 by Russian director Boris Nirenburg, [a film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(1972_film) "Solaris (1972 film)") in 1972 by Russian director [Andrei Tarkovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Tarkovsky "Andrei Tarkovsky")—which won a Special Jury Prize at the [Cannes Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival "Cannes Film Festival") in 1972—and [an American film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(2002_film) "Solaris (2002 film)") in 2002 by [Steven Soderbergh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Soderbergh "Steven Soderbergh").

_Solaris_ is not the only work of Lem's to be filmed. [Over ten film and television adaptations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_works_by_Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem_and_their_adaptations#Dramatic_adaptations "List of works by Stanisław Lem and their adaptations") of his work exist, such as adaptations of _The Astronauts_ (_[First Spaceship on Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Spaceship_on_Venus "First Spaceship on Venus")_, 1960) and _The Magellan Nebula_ (_[Ikarie XB-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikarie_XB-1 "Ikarie XB-1")_, 1963).[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-Swirski2008-36) Lem himself was, however, critical of most of the screen adaptations, with the sole exception of _[Przekładaniec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Przek%C5%82adaniec "Przekładaniec")_ in 1968 by [Andrzej Wajda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Wajda "Andrzej Wajda").[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9) More recently, in 2013, the Israeli–Polish co-production _[The Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Congress_(2013_film) "The Congress (2013 film)")_ was released, inspired by Lem's novel _[The Futurological Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Futurological_Congress "The Futurological Congress")_.[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-filmneweurope-37)

Lem's works have been used in education, for example as teaching texts for philosophy students.[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-textbook-38)

In 1981, the philosophers [Douglas R. Hofstadter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Hofstadter "Douglas Hofstadter") and [Daniel C. Dennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_C._Dennett "Daniel C. Dennett") included three extracts from Lem's fiction in their annotated anthology _[The Mind's I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mind%27s_I "The Mind's I")_, accompanied by Hofstadter's comment, which says in part that Lem's "literary and intuitive approach ... does a better job of convincing readers of his views than any hard-nosed scientific article ... might do".[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-Times-34)

Other influences exerted by Lem's works include [Will Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Wright_(game_designer) "Will Wright (game designer)")'s popular city-planning game _[SimCity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_(1989_video_game) "SimCity (1989 video game)")_, which was partly inspired by Lem's short story _[The Seventh Sally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seventh_Sally "The Seventh Sally")_.[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-NY_Times_Archive-39)

A major character in the film _[Planet 51](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_51 "Planet 51")_, an alien Lem, was named by screenwriter [Joe Stillman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Stillman "Joe Stillman") after Stanisław Lem. Since the film was intended to be a parody of American [pulp science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_magazine "Pulp magazine") shot in Eastern Europe, Stillman thought that it would be hilarious to hint at the writer whose works have nothing to do with [little green men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_green_men "Little green men").[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-40)

Writings
--------

### Science fiction

Stanisław Lem works were influenced by such masters of [Polish literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_literature "Polish literature") as [Cyprian Norwid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprian_Norwid "Cyprian Norwid") and [Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Ignacy_Witkiewicz "Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz").\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] His prose show a mastery of numerous genres and themes.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9)

One of Lem's major recurring themes, beginning from his very first novel, _[The Man from Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_from_Mars "The Man from Mars")_, was the impossibility of [communication between profoundly alien beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_with_extraterrestrial_intelligence "Communication with extraterrestrial intelligence"), which may have no common ground with human intelligence, and humans. The best known example is the living planetary ocean in Lem's novel _[Solaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(novel) "Solaris (novel)")_. Other examples include swarms of mechanical insects (in _[The Invincible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invincible "The Invincible")_), and strangely ordered societies of more human-like beings in _[Fiasco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiasco_(novel) "Fiasco (novel)")_ and _[Eden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_(Lem_novel) "Eden (Lem novel)")_, describing the failure of the [first contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_contact_(science_fiction) "First contact (science fiction)"). In _[His Master's Voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Master%27s_Voice_(novel) "His Master's Voice (novel)")_, Lem describes the failure of humanity's intelligence to decipher and truly comprehend an apparent message from space.[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-google1-41)[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-google2-42)

Two overlapping arcs of short stories, _[Fables for Robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fables_for_Robots "Fables for Robots")_ (_Bajki Robotów_), translated in the collection _[Mortal Engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Engines_(Lem) "Mortal Engines (Lem)")_), and _[The Cyberiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cyberiad "The Cyberiad")_ (_Cyberiada_) provide a commentary on humanity in the form of a series of [grotesque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grotesque "Grotesque"), humorous, [fairytale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairytale "Fairytale")\-like short stories about a mechanical universe inhabited by robots (who have occasional contact with biological "slimies" and human "palefaces").[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9)[\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-solaris-43)

_Śledztwo_ and _Katar_ are [crime novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_novel "Crime novel") (the latter without a murderer); _Pamiętnik..._ is a psychological drama inspired by [Kafka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka "Franz Kafka").[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9)_Doskonała próżnia_ and _Wielkość urojona_ are collections of reviews of non-existent books and introductions to them.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9) Similarly, _Prowokacja_ purports to review a [Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust "Holocaust")\-themed work.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9)

Lem's criticism of most science fiction surfaced in literary and philosophical essays _[Science Fiction and Futurology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Fiction_and_Futurology "Science Fiction and Futurology")_ and interviews.[\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-interview.htm-44) In the 1990s, Lem forswore science fiction and returned to futurological prognostications, most notably those expressed in _[Blink of an Eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blink_of_an_Eye_(Lem)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Blink of an Eye (Lem) (page does not exist)")_ (_[Okamgnienie](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Okamgnienie&action=edit&redlink=1 "Okamgnienie (page does not exist)") \[[pl](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okamgnienie "pl:Okamgnienie")\]_). He became increasingly critical of modern technology in his later life, criticizing inventions such as the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet").[\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-english3-45)

_Dialogi_ and _[Summa Technologiae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summa_Technologiae "Summa Technologiae")_ (1964) are Lem's two most famous philosophical texts. The _Summa_ is notable for being a unique analysis of prospective social, cybernetic, and biological advances;[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem#cite_note-TF-9) in this work, Lem discusses philosophical implications of technologies that were completely in the realm of [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction "Science fiction") at the time, but are gaining importance today—for instance, [virtual reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality "Virtual reality") and [nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology "Nanotechnology").
