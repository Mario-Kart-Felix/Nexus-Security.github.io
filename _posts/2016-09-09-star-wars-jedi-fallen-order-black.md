It's an exciting time of year for Star Wars fans, with the release of [The Mandalorian](https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-mandalorian-episode-1-41-star-wars-easter-eggs/2900-3189/) on [Disney Plus](https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/disney-plus-23-hidden-gems-and-forgotten-tv-shows-/2900-3193/) and [Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker](https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-episode-9-release-/2900-2444/) in theaters this December. To complete the trio, [Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order](https://www.gamespot.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/) released on PS4, Xbox One, and PC on November 15. If you're planning to buy Jedi Fallen Order for yourself or someone on your shopping list this holiday season, you might be looking for discounts on the game this [Black Friday](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-friday-deals-2019-the-best-black-friday-deal/1100-6470200/) and [Cyber Monday](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyber-monday-2019-the-best-cyber-monday-deals-and-/1100-6470253/). Luckily, there are some great Xbox One console bundles planned for Black Friday along with some early discounts on the game itself.

Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order is one of our [top 2019 holiday gift recommendations](https://www.gamespot.com/holiday-gift-guide-2019/); it also earned an 8/10 in our [Jedi Fallen Order review](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-never-tell-me-t/1900-6417364/). "Fallen Order becomes perhaps the strongest conception of what playing as a Jedi Knight ought to really be like," wrote Phil Hornshaw. "It's true that Fallen Order borrows liberally from other action games, but those elements work together with Respawn's combat and environment design, and a story that finds humanity in the Force and in its characters, to hone in on what makes the world of Star Wars worthy of revisiting again and again. Even with some rough edges, Fallen Order represents one of the most compelling game additions to the Star Wars franchise in years."
