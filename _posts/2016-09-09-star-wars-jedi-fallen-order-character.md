### 

[Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order](https://www.gamespot.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/) is a stand-alone, original story but its campaign takes place within the overarching Star Wars mythos. As such, a few of the characters in Fallen Order have been seen in previous Star Wars media, such as movies, books, comics, and TV series. In the following gallery, we list all the Star Wars cameos we've discovered so far.

If you've watched most of the mainline Star Wars stories--such as George Lucas' original trilogy or Dave Filoni's The Clone Wars animated series--then you've seen many of these characters before. Quite a few have played major roles in Star Wars stories, even if their inclusion in Fallen Order is a passing comment or brief cameo.

All that said, this gallery does contain a few major spoilers for Fallen Order. Massive. Huge. Do not keep reading if you haven't yet seen the credits roll, because some of these cameos are tied to major narrative reveals--some as far into Fallen Order's campaign as the final half-hour.

Second Sister -- Darth Vader: Dark Lord Of The Sith 19 - Fortress Vader, Part I
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/1587/15875866/3604508-star-wars-jedi-second-sister.jpg)  

### 

Though specifically created for Fallen Order, Second Sister existed in the Star Wars canon before the game actually released. She first appeared in the 19th issue of Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith, a comic written by Charles Soule and illustrated by Giuseppe Camuncoli. It was first published on August 8, 2018--over a year before Fallen Order's release.

The 19th issue of the comic (Fortress Vader, Part I) begins the fifth and final arc of the Dark Lord of the Sith. The arc begins with Vader leading three Inquisitors to hunt down Eeth Koth, one of the Jedi that survived Order 66. The four find Koth just as his baby is born, and as the three Inquisitors chase down Koth's wife and child, Vader deals with the Jedi.

Though the wife escapes, Koth is killed and one of the Inquisitors manages to rip the baby from their mother's arms and capture the infant--providing Vader with a new person to torture and bend to the Dark Side. After the mission, Vader meets with all of the surviving Inquisitors--including Second Sister--to discuss the final list of confirmed Jedi survivors. The Grand Inquisitor remarks that these Jedi are so well hidden, there's no way each Inquisitor will be able to find their final targets unless the Jedi make a mistake. Luckily for Second Sister and Ninth Sister, one of the Jedi they're hunting (Cal Kestis) does.

  

Ninth Sister -- Darth Vader: Dark Lord Of The Sith 6 - The Chosen One, Part VI
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/1587/15875866/3604509-ninth.png)  

### 

Like Second Sister, Ninth Sister was first introduced into the Star Wars canon in the Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith comic. However, Ninth Sister showed up much earlier, in the sixth issue: The Chosen One, Part VI.

Like Second Sister, Ninth Sister was once a member of the Jedi Order. As a Jedi, she was known as Masana Tide, a powerful Force user who could read people's emotions and deduce their thoughts. When she turned to the Dark Side, this ability was amplified to allow her to read minds. Though her massive size limited her combat ability in comparison to the other Inquisitors, Ninth Sister became one of Darth Vader's most fearsome interrogators.

In the comics, Ninth Sister spends a lot more time with Darth Vader than Second Sister--accompanying him on many missions to hunt down Jedi fugitives. In Fallen Order, you may notice Ninth Sister has two peculiar injuries: she's missing her left eye and right leg. All Inquisitors possess some form of physical disability as part of Darth Vader's method of teaching them about loss; in Ninth Sister's case, he carved out her eye.

The loss of her leg is a much longer story, though the gist of it boils down to betrayal. The Ninth Sister lost her leg when the Sixth Brother cut it off, hoping to slow her down long enough so he could escape a squad of leftover clone troopers who had been mind-tricked by an escaped Jedi to execute Order 66. Though the mind trick led the clones to kill the Jedi as well, it also turned the clones on Ninth Sister and Sixth Brother, both of whom were former Jedi. Ninth Sister managed to survive, however, vowing revenge on Sixth Brother. Given Sixth Brother's death at the hands of Ahsoka Tano during the events of Star Wars: Ahsoka (a novel written by E. K. Johnston that predates the events of Fallen Order by a few years), Ninth Sister never got her vengeance--leaving her with a seething hatred that she would unleash upon an unsuspecting Cal Kestis.

  

Talzin -- Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Season 3, Episode 4 - Nightsisters
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/1587/15875866/3604484-mother.jpeg)  

### 

Upon reaching Dathomir, you will eventually encounter one of the last surviving Nightsisters, a young witch named Merrin. She tells Cal that she's the last of her kind, as when she was a young girl a heavily armored creature with the weapons of a Jedi came to her village and slaughtered her sisters and mother. There are quite a few people referenced here, but the big one is Merrin's "mother." In this case, it's most likely Talzin, the clan mother of the Nightsisters and one of the most powerful Force wielders in the galaxy.

First introduced into the Star Wars canon in 2011 during the third season of The Clone Wars animated series, Talzin has since appeared or been mentioned in several Star Wars video games, novels, and comics. She is the biological mother of Darth Maul and his brother Savage Opress--which is why both are so powerful in the dark side of the Force. Prior to being clan mother, Talzin witnessed Darth Sidious kidnapping her first son and the event caused her to hate the Sith. This hatred would fester as Sidious abandoned Maul following his defeat by Obi-Wan Kenobi, and continue to grow as Sidious' apprentice, Darth Tyrannous (aka Count Dooku), abused former Nightsister Asajj Ventress.

When Ventress finally returned home, Talzin saw her chance for revenge and plotted to kill Tyrannous. Her plan ultimately failed, and Tyrannous responded by sending General Grievous (most likely the armored figure Merrin mentioned) along with an army of battle droids to wipe out the Nightsisters--as seen in The Clone Wars, Season 4, Episode 19. Talzin was killed, but she continues to live on as a dark spirit--her and her Nightsisters' mastery over death extending the lives of their souls for many years.

  

Saw Gerrera -- Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Season 5, Episode 2 - A War On Two Fronts
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/1587/15875866/3604489-saw.jpg)  

### 

Like Talzin, Saw Gerrera is a character first introduced in The Clone Wars animated series who has since gone on to be featured in multiple pieces of Star Wars media and literature. In Fallen Order, we see a Saw who's still on the younger side--years away from being the broken man we see in Rogue One, though fairly close to the results-oriented leader we see in Rebels.

Saw is introduced in The Clone Wars as a young man and leader of a group of freedom fighters alongside his sister Steela and former Seperatist Lux Bonteri. In a bid to take back their home planet from the Separatists, Saw and Lux reached out to the Republic for aid, and the Jedi Council sent Anakin, Obi-Wan, clone captain Rex, and Jedi padawan Ahsoka. The Jedi aided the rebels in their campaign, which was ultimately victorious--though Steela lost her life in the final conflict, killed when a stray rocket fired by Saw caused an explosion that sent her off a cliff.

Saw would never forgive himself for what he did, and this would influence him to seek victory in future battles as quickly as possible and by any means necessary. In Fallen Order, you can begin to see how this line of thought ultimately changed Saw for the worse. Though he does initially aid the Wookies in stopping the Empire occupation, Saw abandons Kashyyyk when it's apparent the rebels cannot win. Saw's selfishness in ensuring none of his people ever got hurt in the service of others would continue to grow as time went on, ultimately leading to the extremist ideals that got him kicked out of the Rebel Alliance prior to the events of Rogue One.

  

Tarfful -- Star Wars Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith
-----------------------------------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/1587/15875866/3604490-tar.jpeg)  

### 

Wookiee chieftain Tarfful is first seen in Revenge of the Sith, leading the Wookiees alongside Yoda's army of clones in the Battle of Kashyyyk. The chieftain would later aid Yoda in his escape of the planet following Order 66.

A hero of the Clone Wars, Tarfful lead the Wookie resistance against the Empire following the fall of the Galactic Republic. One of Tarfful's closest friends is Chewbacca, a Wookie that would be captured by the Empire and sold into slavery--ultimately meeting Han Solo during the events of Solo: A Star Wars Story. Tarfful goes on to make new allies following Chewbacca's capture, including Cal Kestis.

  

Yoda -- Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back
----------------------------------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/1587/15875866/3604491-yoda-retina_2a7ecc26.jpeg)  

### 

After breaking his lightsaber on Dathomir, Cal travels to Ilos, an ice planet that all youngling Jedi visit in order to find Kyber crystals--a key component for their lightsabers. The planet was first mentioned in 2009, in The Essential Atlas, before being shown in The Clone Wars animated series. On the planet, Cal mentions coming to the planet once before alongside Jedi Master Yoda.

The second-longest-living creature in the Star Wars canon--dying a few centuries short of catching up to Maz Kanata--Yoda is one of the most legendary Jedi to have ever lived, providing counsel to young Force wielders even after his death. During the events of Fallen Order, Yoda is still alive--though Cal and Cere don't know this--and is in hiding on the planet Dagobah.

  

Darth Vader -- Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope
-----------------------------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/1587/15875866/3604492-vader.jpg)  

### 

In the final moments of Fallen Order, Cal faces off against Second Sister--formerly Cere's Jedi padawan, Trilla. After beating her in combat, Cal allows her to live. Cere then approaches, apologizing for her role in turning Trilla to the dark side. For a brief moment, the face of Second Sister falls away and Cal and Cere get to see the true Trilla. Then, the trio hears the heavy breathing of the man responsible for twisting Trilla to the dark side: Darth Vader. The Sith Lord, seeing that Trilla is becoming a Jedi again, immediately executes her.

Prior to this moment, Darth Vader is busy leading the other Inquisitors in the hunt for other Jedi fugitives--as detailed in the final issues of the Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith comic--and coming up empty. Even some of his Inquisitors are beginning to betray him. As seen in Vader: Immortal, he's also searching for a way to bring his dead wife back to life and failing to do so. To put it bluntly, he is not happy. These negative emotions only amplify his connection to the dark side, though, transforming him into one of the most powerful beings in the galaxy.

This is largely why Cal cannot defeat Darth Vader and is forced to flee--the Sith Lord's growing hatred at the sight of a Jedi is so strong, it causes the Force to begin shaking the Imperial station apart. Vader is too powerful for someone like Cal to take on alone. Fallen Order ends before we learn whether Vader ever catches up to Cal, but the Sith Lord would eventually return to his hunt for his former master Obi-Wan Kenobi, a search that would lead him into conflict against his former apprentice, Ahsoka Tano.
