[Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order](https://www.gamespot.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/), the new, single-player melee action game from the makers of [Titanfall](https://www.gamespot.com/titanfall/) and [Apex Legends](https://www.gamespot.com/apex-legends/), is almost here. The game officially launches on Friday, November 15, but copies of the game have begun to appear in the wild already.

There are [reports on Reddit and elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/FallenOrder/) of people getting their hands on the much-anticipated Star Wars game ahead of time. Players who are keen to avoid spoilers are advised to be extra careful on social media, as information about the story could emerge.

Jedi Fallen Order takes place five years after Revenge of the Sith. The story, which is canon, follows a Jedi Padawan named Cal Kestis (played by Gotham's Joker, Cameron Monaghan) who is trying to outrun Empire forces trying to eliminate all Jedis. The main enemy is Darth Vader's trainee, the Second Sister, who is chasing Cal across the solar system.

Unlike other EA-published games, Jedi Fallen Order is _not_ available early for EA Access subscribers. That's a bummer, as playing upcoming EA games early is in part what makes the subscription service so attractive. However, EA/Origin Access subscribers are getting [free bonus content for Jedi Fallen Order.](https://twitter.com/EAAccess/status/1193958401874653184)

Early copies of Jedi Fallen Order emerging in the wild have appeared just as pre-loading for the game has begun. Respawn announced on Twitter that people who pre-ordered a digital copy of the game can start pre-loading now on PS4, Xbox One, and PC. The file size relatively small compared to other big AAA games, weighing in at around 37 GB (on Xbox One, at least).

As for when you can actually start playing Jedi Fallen Order, the game will [reportedly unlock at midnight local time](https://www.reddit.com/r/FallenOrder/comments/dspz87/updated_faq_thread_star_wars_jedi_fallen_order/).

Jedi Fallen Order is expected to be a massive success commercially, as EA is expecting the game to sell [as many as 8 million copies at launch.](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-expects-jedi-fallen-order-to-sell-as-many-as-8-/1100-6466759/) The NPD expects it to be [among the best-selling games of 2019 in the US.](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/these-will-be-the-top-10-best-selling-games-of-201/1100-6470004/)

In other news, Mad TV actress Debra Wilson appears in Jedi Fallen Order as a Jedi named Cere Junda. She spoke to [The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-actor-debra-wilson-is-a-prolific-force-1254542) about the significance of her character and why she's excited to be in the game.

"I believe I'm the first black female Jedi as far as video games are concerned," Wilson said. "To be a part of the Star Wars universe in this regard is amazing. Growing up with Star Wars from a very early age--well not that early because I'm a little older--it had a very powerful impact on me."
