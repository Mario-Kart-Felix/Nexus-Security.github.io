[Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order](https://www.gamespot.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/) is just the third Star Wars title of this console generation--it follows the [first](https://www.gamespot.com/star-wars-battlefront/) and [second](https://www.gamespot.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii/) Battlefront games for PS4, Xbox One and PC, the same systems that Fallen Order is available on. The game, made by [Titanfall](https://www.gamespot.com/titanfall/) and [Apex Legends](https://www.gamespot.com/apex-legends/) developer Respawn Entertainment, puts you in the Force-sensitive boots of Jedi warrior Cal Kestis and sends you out into a post-Revenge of the Sith version of the Star Wars universe.

Reviews have gone up alongside the release of the game, including [our own 8/10 take](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-the-friends-we-/1900-6417364/). "Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, the latest game in the canon, is one of the better offerings specifically because it tries to look beyond the trappings of Star Wars," our critic Phil Hornshaw says. "It's not just another Jedi power fantasy, although wielding the Force with skill and resolve will certainly make you feel powerful. Like the best Star Wars games, it's one that adds to the ideas of the films and other material, exploring new corners of the galaxy while focusing on the core themes of the franchise: knowing yourself, fighting your own darkness, and braving adversity with the help of friends."

Other reviews have also mostly been positive so far, with most outlets praising this as a return to form for Star Wars, which hasn't received a substantial single-player game in some time. There's also some consensus, though, that the game can feel a bit rough or become frustrating in some sections.

We've rounded up a few of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order's reviews below. For more, be sure to check out GameSpot's sister site [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order) for a look at what even more critics made of the game.

**GameSpot - 8/10**
-------------------

"But especially as it wears on, Fallen Order becomes perhaps the strongest conception of what playing as a Jedi Knight ought to really be like. It's true that Fallen Order borrows liberally from other action games, but those elements work together with Respawn's combat and environment design, and a story that finds humanity in the Force and in its characters, to hone in on what makes the world of Star Wars worthy of revisiting again and again. Even with some rough edges, Fallen Order represents one of the most compelling game additions to the Star Wars franchise in years." - _Phil Hornshaw_ \[[Full Review](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-the-friends-we-/1900-6417364/./)\]

**IGN - 9/10**
--------------

"It’s been ages since we got a great single-player Star Wars action game, but Jedi: Fallen Order makes up for a lot of lost time. A strong cast sells a dark story while keeping things fun and loyal to Star Wars lore, and fast, challenging combat mixes with energetic platforming, decent puzzles, and diverse locations to explore for an all-around amazing game." - _Brian Shea_ \[[Full Review](https://au.ign.com/articles/2019/11/15/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review)\]

**Game Informer - 8.75/10**
---------------------------

"Despite these numerous little problems, Respawn’s maiden voyage with Star Wars is largely a success. I couldn’t put this game down, both for the thrill of exploring and wanting to see where the story took me next. The inspirations taken from Dark Souls, Uncharted, and Metroid Prime unite to create something unique that just happens to work incredibly well for this beloved license. Like most starships in this universe, Jedi: Fallen Order could use a little polish, but the rust doesn’t hold it back from roaring with excitement." - _Andrew Reiner_ \[[Full Review](https://www.gameinformer.com/review/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-a-turbulent-thrill-ride)\]

**Gamesradar+ - 4/5**
---------------------

"There's plenty to like about Fallen Order, but it should come with the caveat that it's slightly rougher than I was expecting. I've played the entire game on PS4 Pro and glitches and framerate stuttering have cropped up enough to warrant mentioning. One patch has already been released before launch, and EA has told us that another is on the way, but it did give my initial playthrough a rougher-than-ideal feel." - _Ben Tyrer_ \[[Full Review](https://www.gamesradar.com/au/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review/)\]

**USGamer - 3.5/5**
-------------------

"Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order comes painfully close to being the best action game of the year, but it ultimately falls short due to pacing problems and a host of technical issues. Still, this is the first step into a larger world for a franchise that has persistently struggled since its acquisition by EA." - _Kat Bailey_ \[[Full Review](https://www.usgamer.net/articles/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review)\]

**Eurogamer - No Score**
------------------------

"I'll admit crunching a Souls-like in less than four days is an unnatural and grueling experience: I imagine if I'd played Fallen Order over several months, I would have been less frustrated, but probably still bored. It's such a shame, as Fallen Order has an incredible gameplay experience at its core, with fantastic environments and well-directed action sequences. Yet it's unable to sustain this thanks to some fundamental design problems." - _Emma Kent_ \[[Full Review](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-14-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-solid-combat-mired-in-shallow-storytelling-and-technical-problems)\]
