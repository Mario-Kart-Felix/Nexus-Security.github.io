Early on in [Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order](https://www.gamespot.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/), your droid pal BD-1 gets in a fight with a Bog Rat on Bogano. While Cal quickly attends to BD-1's physical injuries, his handy Scomp Link tool is destroyed. At first, you might not understand how this impacts your journey, and after a while, you may even forget it happened. Though if you're a Star Wars fan, you likely understand the implications of this technical difficulty. Still, once you encounter a locked door or chest that can only be opened with a Scomp Link, you'll immediately want to know where you can find a replacement.

For the uninitiated, a Scomp Link is a droid accessory that allows you to plug into terminals to reveal hidden passageways, as well as open up locked chests. You eventually get a new one for BD-1 later on in the story, but you can get it earlier if want to access the game's many locked doors and chests earlier.

Below we outline where to get a new Scomp Link for BD-1.

How To Get A New Scomp Link
---------------------------

You can't get a new Scomp Link until a few hours into exploring the game's second planet, Zeffo. So go ahead and progress the story until you get the Force Push ability from the underground temple. Once you've got that Jedi trick in your arsenal, head to the Weathered Monument area at the center of the map. Any new locations that can be accessed with your abilities are highlighted in green; in this area, you'll find a cracked stone door you can now topple with Force Push.

Make short work of that door and jump down to what appears to be an Imperial station situated around a sizeable Zeffo statue. Proceed left down the path going around the center piston until you reach a wall you can climb up. Scale upwards, and you should find a workbench containing a brand new Scomp Link.

And voila! You now have the means to unlock all those locked doors and chests you so begrudgingly had to leave for later. And even better, you're set to open all locked doors only accessible via the Scomp Link in the game's subsequent areas. To think where you would've been if you hadn't done this sooner. No more must you wallow away in suffering or lose countless hours of sleep at night. All secret pathways and locked chests are clear! At least, the ones the Scomp Link unlock, that is.

Similar to when you get a new Force ability, any areas that can only be accessed with the Scomp Link will be newly highlighted on the map as green. Unfortunately, any chests you've left unopened won't show up, so it's worth making a run through any areas you've been through again to see what you might've missed.
