The Star Wars movies are some of the biggest titles available on [Disney+](https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&jsonp=vglnk_157365813060412&key=54097c7e8593d23afad397e432d879de&libId=k2xfebgg0102qieo000DAizqo2oeb&loc=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-plus-star-wars-han-shoots-first-scene-chang/1100-6471369/&v=1&opt=true&out=https://www.cnet.com/news/disney-plus-streaming-service-launch-timing-prices-shows-movies-mandalorian-marvel-avengers/&ref=https://www.gamespot.com/entertainment/&title=Disney Plus: Star Wars' ), which finally launched this week. All but two of the 10 movies released to date are available to stream right now--and they have the added bonus of being in 4K, most for the first time ever.

The original trilogy, the prequels, The Force Awakens, and the spin-off Rogue One are all on Disney+ in 4K Dolby Vision HDR. Of these, only the latter two have been released in the format before. So for fans making do with the Blu-ray releases of the first six movies, it's time to check them out looking better than they ever have. In addition, the movies have Dolby Atmos sound, meaning they will sound amazing too.

Earlier this year, it was [rumored](https://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-4k-blu-ray-box-set/) that Disney was working on a 4K Blu-ray box set, but with these new versions of the movies now on Disney+, it seems unlikely that we'll see that any time soon. And in case you were wondering, these are the Special Editions of the classic trilogy, with all George Lucas's digital additions, not the original theatrical versions. In addition, there has been [one notable change](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-plus-star-wars-han-shoots-first-scene-chang/1100-6471369/) to the notorious confrontation between Han Solo and Greedo in A New Hope.
