_Immigration rules are subject to change, so I'll try and keep this article up to date as much as possible._

This article has last been updated: **December 2019**.

Our world is increasingly connected, enabling us to live and work wherever we want to, passport and visas permitting of course.

When you spend most time outside of your home country, and youâ€™re then looking for a place to base your startup, there are a few options available to you.

The world has been observing whatâ€™s happening in Silicon Valley, and as a result countries are trying to make it attractive for startups to be based within their shores, especially in light of US visa hurdles.

This article contains a list of countries offering startup visas, programs and special economic zones directly targeted at attracting startups and entrepreneurs.

**Disclaimer**: _Do not use this as official legal, immigration, or tax advice. Before choosing a structure for your business, including where to establish your base, seek the help of a certified professional._

_There's a ton of nuance involved in migrating to another country, so use this as a resource to guide you, then inform yourself with the relevant, official authorities._

Now that's out of the way, let's begin.

Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º
--------------

![](http://futureworkpresent.com/content/images/2019/12/Uluru_50.jpg)

### Name

[Business Innovation and Investment (_Provisional_) Subclass 188](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/business-innovation-and-investment-188) (_Entrepreneur Stream_)

### Type

Temporary visa allowing you and your family to live and work in Australia for up to 4 years and 3 months.

### High level process

Australia is a notoriously hard country to migrate to. In a nutshell you have to:

*   Register an expression of interest (_EOI_) to apply - which is a process where the government can assess if you're even eligible to apply for immigration
*   Be nominated by an Australian State or Territory government agency
*   Get a funding agreement of at least A$200,000
*   Get a business plan approved

If the business does well it can lead to a permanent visa.

Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
-----------

### Name

[Start-up Visa Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/start-visa.html)

### Type

Permanent residency

### High level process

Get investment or sponsored by a [designated organisation](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/start-visa/designated-organizations.html), which involves receiving either at least C$75,000 via angel investment, or at least C$200,000 from a VC. This leads to a letter of support, which you can then use to migrate.

Cayman Islands ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¾
-------------------

![](http://futureworkpresent.com/content/images/2019/12/Cayman.jpg)

### Name

[Cayman Enterprise City (_CEC_)](https://www.caymanenterprisecity.com/)

### Type

**Free Zone**: A free zone is a special economic zone within a country, usually designed to attract businesses either via tax benefits or other incentives.

### High level process

You submit all relevant forms to the free zone and if successful, you pay the fees, wait for your visas to be issued and that's it:

*   100% exemption from income tax
*   100% exemption from corporate tax
*   100% exemption from capital gains tax
*   100% foreign ownership permitted
*   100% exemption from import duties
