Title:Statistical Consequences of Fat Tails: Real World Preasymptotics, Epistemology, and Applications
======================================================================================================

(Submitted on 24 Jan 2020)

> Abstract: The book investigates the misapplication of conventional statistical techniques to fat tailed distributions and looks for remedies, when possible.  
> Switching from thin tailed to fat tailed distributions requires more than "changing the color of the dress". Traditional asymptotics deal mainly with either n=1 or $n=\\infty$, and the real world is in between, under of the "laws of the medium numbers" --which vary widely across specific distributions. Both the law of large numbers and the generalized central limit mechanisms operate in highly idiosyncratic ways outside the standard Gaussian or Levy-Stable basins of convergence.  
> A few examples:  
> \+ The sample mean is rarely in line with the population mean, with effect on "naive empiricism", but can be sometimes be estimated via parametric methods.  
> \+ The "empirical distribution" is rarely empirical.  
> \+ Parameter uncertainty has compounding effects on statistical metrics.  
> \+ Dimension reduction (principal components) fails.  
> \+ Inequality estimators (GINI or quantile contributions) are not additive and produce wrong results.  
> \+ Many "biases" found in psychology become entirely rational under more sophisticated probability distributions  
> \+ Most of the failures of financial economics, econometrics, and behavioral economics can be attributed to using the wrong distributions.  
> This book, the first volume of the Technical Incerto, weaves a narrative around published journal articles.
