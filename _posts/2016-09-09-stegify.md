**Stegify - Go Tool For LSB Steganography, Capable Of Hiding Any File Within An Image**

The `Result` file contains the `Data` file [hidden](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Hidden "hidden") in it. And as you can see it is fully transparent.  
  
**Install**

```
$ go get -u [github.com/DimitarPetrov/stegify](http://github.com/DimitarPetrov/stegify)
```

  
**Usage**  
  
**As a command line tool**

```
$ stegify -op encode -carrier -data -result $ stegify -op [decode](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Decode "decode") -carrier -result 
```

When encoding, the file with name given to flag `-data` is hidden inside the file with name given to flag `-carrier` and the resulting file is saved in new file in the current working directory under the name given to flag `-result`. The file extension of result file is inherited from the carrier file and must not be specified explicitly in the `-result` flag.  
When decoding, given a file name of a carrier file with previously encoded data in it, the data is extracted and saved in new file in the current working directory under the name given to flag `-result`. The result file won't have any file extension and therefore it should be specified explicitly in `-result` flag.  
In both cases the flag `-result` could be omitted and it will be used the default file name: `result`  
  
**Programmatically in your code**  
`stegify` can be used programmatically too and it provides easy to use functions working with file names or raw Readers and Writers. You can visit [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/DimitarPetrov/stegify "godoc") under `steg` package for details.  
  
**Disclaimer**  
If carrier file is in jpeg or jpg format, after encoding the result file image will be png encoded (therefore it may be bigger in size) despite of file extension inherited from the original carrier file (which is .jpeg or .jpg).
