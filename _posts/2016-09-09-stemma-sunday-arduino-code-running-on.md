Wow, yesterday we got our MicroPython PR merged, and today we’ve got a PR out to the stm32duino team to add this fine Feather as a supported board. This demo shows how we have I2C support working with a 128×32 OLED and a STEMMA QT MSA301 accelerometer. With the connector right on board, its plug-n-play easy to add sensors! – [YouTube](https://youtu.be/SUTqn4glvqY).

> WHAT IS STEMMA? STEMMA is not an original idea, we’re working within an ecosystem of many other plug and play systems. We started [STEMMA in 2014](http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=86384236&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch), and intended to be compatible with Grove only (cause that’s all that existed at the time) but then when Qwiic came around in 2017, added a smaller connector so we could work with those parts too!
> 
> **STEMMA attempts to be as cross-compatible as possible with both Grove and Gravity** (compatible connectors & 3-5V power/logic). STEMMA QT is cross-compatible with Qwiic - STEMMA QT connector/cable is same as Qwiic. You can use STEMMA QT devices with Qwiic devices/controllers.
