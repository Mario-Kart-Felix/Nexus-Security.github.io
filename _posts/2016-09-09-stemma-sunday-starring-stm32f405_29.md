The new STM32F405 Feather ([video](https://youtu.be/CZ6TtvYJTeI)) that we designed runs CircuitPython at a blistering 168MHz – our fastest CircuitPython board ever! We put a STEMMA QT / Qwiic port on the end, so you can really easily plug and play I2C sensors. With CircuitPython basics running on this board, its fast to get all our drivers working, then use the built in plotter in Mu to instantly get sensor data displaying within 3 minutes of unboxing.

> WHAT IS STEMMA? STEMMA is not an original idea, we’re working within an ecosystem of many other plug and play systems. We started [STEMMA in 2014](http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=86384236&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch), and intended to be compatible with Grove only (cause that’s all that existed at the time) but then when Qwiic came around in 2017, added a smaller connector so we could work with those parts too!
> 
> **STEMMA attempts to be as cross-compatible as possible with both Grove and Gravity** (compatible connectors & 3-5V power/logic). STEMMA QT is cross-compatible with Qwiic - STEMMA QT connector/cable is same as Qwiic. You can use STEMMA QT devices with Qwiic devices/controllers.
