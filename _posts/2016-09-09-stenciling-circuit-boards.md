The stencil machine takes in circuit boards and applies solder paste to them before they head into the Pick and Place. Amazingly, this behemoth machine is capable of up to 0.01mm positional accuracy!

One of the best parts of operating the stencil machine is watching it knead the solder paste back and forth, transferring the solder paste onto the PCB below.

Happy [Manufacturing Monday](https://blog.adafruit.com/category/manufacturing/?utm_source=vine&utm_medium=vine%20caption&utm_campaign=manumonday) from Adafruit!
