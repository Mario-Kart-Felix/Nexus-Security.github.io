[Pantone 19-4052](https://www.pantone.com/color-intelligence/color-of-the-year/color-of-the-year-2020) was named the color of the year, you might know it better as Classic Blue.

How does classic blue make you feel? This was the prompt _Submerge_ looked to explore with Pantone and ARTECHOUSE.

> How do we experience color? How can colors elicit complex responses and connections? ARTECHOUSE NYC opens its 2020 season with an immersive exploration of color, inviting visitors to descend into the sights, sounds and feelings of PANTONE 19-4052 Classic Blue.

Via [Mashable](https://mashable.com/article/pantone-color-blue-artechouse-art-digital-installation/):

> Classic Blue — PANTONE 19-4052, more precisely — offers feelings of protection, stability, and clarity “as we cross the threshold into a new era” and “as technology continues to race ahead of the human ability to process it all,” [according](https://www.pantone.com/pages/pantone/pantone.aspx?pg=20194&ca=10) to Pantone.

> As the 18 projectors around the space continued to emit blue lights and as the image of Madonna faded away, I was reminded of how the color blue is fundamental to our understanding of reality. After all, it’s one of only three primary colors that make up the [visible light spectrum](http://web.mit.edu/6.813/www/sp18/classes/15-color/) — the [source](http://web.mit.edu/6.813/www/sp18/classes/15-color/) of human vision and color perception. Religiously, too, it’s often associated [with Madonna](https://www.nga.gov/research/in-depth/madonna-child.html), heaven, and the divine truth.
