LIDAR has gained much popularity as a means for self-driving cars to survey the space around them. At their most basic, LIDAR is a surveying method that uses lasers to paints the space around the sensors and assembles the distances measured from reflected light into a digital three-dimensional representation. That’s something that has quite a number of other applications, from surveying ancient ruins and rainforests from a bird’s eye view to developing 3D models of indoor spaces.

Originally an entry in the 2016 Hackaday Prize, \[Adam\] has continued to work on the project. The result shown in the video below is a cheaper 3D LIDAR setup that works by rotating the laser distance module on 2 axes with a sensor centered at the center of rotation. It works for volumetric calculations, detects change over time, and identifies various water patterns and rocks on a surface map. Compared to notebooks, tape measures, and compasses, it’s certainly a step up in cave surveying technology.

Check out some other past underground surveying projects, such as [Iowa City’s beer caves scanning projects](https://clas.uiowa.edu/geography/resources/news/iowa-city-beer-caves-lidar-scanning-project) and National Geographic’s 2014 [expedition of the Titan Chamber](https://www.spar3d.com/news/hardware/laser-scanners-boldly-go/) in southern Guizhou Province in China.
