[![](https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Silicone-Hose-Robot-Wheel.jpg?w=400)](https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Silicone-Hose-Robot-Wheel.jpg)Anyone who has delved into DIY wheels knows that they are a trickier than it may seem, especially if the wheels aren’t just for show and need to provide things like decent traction and durability. 3D printers have helped a lot, but they’re not a cure-all.

Check out how \[Robert K.\] [makes wheels from segments of automotive silicone hose](http://www.wiresandbits.co.uk/2019/05/making-beetleweight-wheels.html), which are constructed with fibers embedded within them for durability and structure. Not only are these hoses easily sourced, but the silicone makes a great wheel surface and the hoses themselves are highly durable. He uses a 3D printed jig to cut a slice of hose that press-fits perfectly onto a 3D printed hub. \[Robert\] finds that a 28 mm hose pulled over a 35 mm diameter wheel is a perfect fit.

These wheels are for a Beetleweight class combat robot, which are limited to three pounds (1.36 kg) or less. You can see some video of [\[Robert\]’s previous Beetleweight robot named ‘Bourbon’](http://www.wiresandbits.co.uk/2018/02/bourbon-at-uwe-beetle-brawl-feb-2018.html), and [we have featured what goes into the even-smaller Antweight class](https://hackaday.com/2017/08/17/krave-antweight-robot-gets-eaten-and-stays-alive/) (one pound or less) in the past.
