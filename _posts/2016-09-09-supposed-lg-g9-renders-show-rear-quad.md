Contrary to rumors about LG discontinuing its [flagship G-series smartphones](https://beebom.com/dual-screen-lg-g8x-thinq-launched-india/), the company may very well be working on the next device in the lineup if a new report from a well-known tipster is anything to go by. According to Steve H. McFly _(@OnLeaks)_, the LG G9 is in advanced stages of development, and the company is bestowing it with four cameras on the back as part of its plans to position it as a photography-centric device, like the also rumoured [Nokia 9.2 PureView which reportedly got delayed recently](https://beebom.com/nokia-9-2-pureview-delayed-late-2020/).  

As can be seen from the CAD renders published by tech blog, CashKaro, the device will ship with a quad-cam setup at the back, arranged neatly in a horizontal housing at the top. Upfront, the renders show a tiny teardrop notch for the selfie-cam, while the lack of a physical fingerprint scanner at the back suggests that it might support an in-display sensor, though it’s not immediately clear if it will be the [recently-announced ultrasonic unit from Qualcomm](https://beebom.com/qualcomm-new-3d-sonic-max-in-display-fingerprint-sensor-announced/).

The renders also show what seems to be a rather large display that is said to be between 6.7-inches and 6.9-inches in size. The device also seemingly sports a USB Type-C port for charging and data syncing, as well as a 3.5mm audio socket – a feature that seems to have gone the way of the dodo, at least, in flagship smartphones. According to the report, the device will measure around 169.4 x 77.6 x 8.8mm, while the camera bump is said to add a further 0.6mm to the thickness.  

  

Do note that the aforementioned details are based on only one source, and even though McFly has a proven track record for the most part, it would be for the best if we wait a bit longer to get the information verified by other sources independently. Either way, it’s not immediately clear as to when LG will announce the device officially, but given that the [G8 was unveiled](https://beebom.com/lg-g8-thinq-lets-you-wave-to-the-selfie-camera-to-unlock-smartphone/) at the MWC last year, it won’t be totally out of place to expect LG to unveil its successor at around the same time this year.
