[Danielle Baskin](https://daniellebaskin.com/), the “viral artist” and entrepreneur known for her [drone sweaters](https://www.dronesweaters.com/) and [laser-branded fruit](https://brandedfruit.com/), has come up with a clever idea for satisfying facial recognition software while wearing the common N95 surgical mask. She’ll print the area of your face that the mask covers with an image of that area onto the masks.

Like most of Danielle’s work, this is both something of conceptual/high-tech art and commerce. [She plans](https://faceidmasks.com/) to eventually allow you to upload an image of your face and buy masks with your face printed on them. But she plans to wait for the current worldwide shortage of N95s to be over.
