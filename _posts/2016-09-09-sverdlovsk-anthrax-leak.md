1979 accidental release of anthrax in the Soviet Union

On 2 April 1979, spores of [anthrax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthrax "Anthrax") were accidentally released from a [Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet "Soviet") military research facility near the city of [Sverdlovsk, Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdlovsk,_Russia "Sverdlovsk, Russia") (now Yekaterinburg). The ensuing outbreak of the disease resulted in approximately 100 deaths, although the exact number of victims remains unknown. The cause of the outbreak was denied for years by the Soviet authorities, which blamed the deaths on consumption of tainted meat from the area, and [subcutaneous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue "Subcutaneous tissue") exposure due to butchers handling the tainted meat. All medical records of the victims were removed to hide serious violations of the [Biological Weapons Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_Weapons_Convention "Biological Weapons Convention"). The accident is sometimes referred to as "biological [Chernobyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster "Chernobyl disaster")".[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdlovsk_anthrax_leak#cite_note-Alibek-1)

Background
----------

The [closed city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_city "Closed city") of Sverdlovsk had been a major production center of the Soviet [military-industrial complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military-industrial_complex "Military-industrial complex") since [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"). It produced [tanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank "Tank"), [ballistic missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile "Ballistic missile"), [rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket "Rocket") and other armaments. A major nuclear accident happened in this region in 1957, when a [nuclear waste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_waste "Radioactive waste") facility exploded (known as the [Kyshtym disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyshtym_disaster "Kyshtym disaster")), resulting in the spread of radioactive dust over a thousand square kilometers. The biological weapons facility in Sverdlovsk was built after World War II, using documentation captured in [Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchuria "Manchuria") from the [Japanese germ warfare program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731 "Unit 731").[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdlovsk_anthrax_leak#cite_note-Alibek-1)

The strain of [anthrax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthrax "Anthrax") produced in the [Military Compound 19](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Military_Compound_19&action=edit&redlink=1 "Military Compound 19 (page does not exist)") \[[ru](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%80_%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%85_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BC_%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%89%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%8B_%D0%9D%D0%98%D0%98_%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%B8_%D0%9C%D0%9E_%D0%A0%D0%A4 "ru:Центр военно-технических проблем бактериологической защиты НИИ микробиологии МО РФ")\] on the southern edge of Sverdlovsk was the most powerful in the Soviet arsenal ("Anthrax 836"). It had been isolated as a result of another anthrax leak accident that happened in 1953 in the [city of Kirov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirov,_Kirov_Oblast "Kirov, Kirov Oblast"). A leak from a bacteriological facility contaminated the city sewer system. In 1956, biologist Vladimir Sizov found a more virulent strain in rodents captured in this area. This strain was planned to be used to arm [warheads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhead "Warhead") for the [SS-18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS-18 "SS-18") [ICBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile "Intercontinental ballistic missile"), which would target American cities, among other targets.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdlovsk_anthrax_leak#cite_note-Alibek-1)

Accident
--------

The produced anthrax culture had to be dried to produce a fine powder for use as an aerosol. Large filters over the exhaust pipes were the only barriers between the anthrax dust and the outside environment. On Friday, 30 March 1979 a technician removed a clogged filter while drying machines were temporarily turned off. He left a written notice, but his supervisor did not write this down in the logbook as he was supposed to do. The supervisor of the next shift did not find anything unusual in the logbook and turned the machines on. In a few hours, someone found that the filter was missing and reinstalled it. The incident was reported to military command, but local and city officials were not immediately informed. [Boris Yeltsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin "Boris Yeltsin"), a local Communist Party official at this time, helped cover up the accident.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdlovsk_anthrax_leak#cite_note-Alibek-1)

All workers of a ceramic plant across the street fell ill during the next few days. Almost all of them died within a week. The death toll is claimed to be at least 105,\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] but the exact number is unknown, as all hospital records and other evidence were destroyed by the [KGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGB "KGB"), according to former [Biopreparat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopreparat "Biopreparat") deputy director [Ken Alibek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Alibek "Ken Alibek").[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdlovsk_anthrax_leak#cite_note-Alibek-1)

In 1986, Professor [Matthew Meselson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Meselson "Matthew Meselson") of [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "Harvard University") was granted approval by Soviet authorities for a four-day trip to Moscow where he interviewed several senior Soviet health officials about the outbreak. He later issued a report which agreed with the Soviet assessment that the outbreak was caused by a contaminated meat processing plant concluding the Soviets official explanation was completely "plausible and consistent with what is known from medical literature and recorded human experiences with anthrax".[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdlovsk_anthrax_leak#cite_note-Goldberg,_Jeff_2001-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdlovsk_anthrax_leak#cite_note-3)

Following an admission by President Boris Yeltsin, Sverdlovsk's Communist Party chief in 1979, of the true nature of the anthrax outbreak, _[Wall Street Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Journal "Wall Street Journal")_ reporter [Peter Gumbel](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Gumbel&action=edit&redlink=1 "Peter Gumbel (page does not exist)") traveled to Sverdlovsk where he interviewed families affected by the outbreak, hospital workers, and various officials, confirming Yeltsin's comments.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdlovsk_anthrax_leak#cite_note-Goldberg,_Jeff_2001-2) Based on these reports a team of Western inspectors led by Meselson gained access to the region in 1992. Before they arrived they had been provided by the authorities with a list of 68 known incident victims in Sverdlovsk. By visiting and questioning in their homes surviving relatives of those who had died, the investigating researchers ascertained both where the victims had been living and where they had been during daylight hours at the time during which hospital admission records indicated a possible release into the atmosphere of anthrax dust. When the locations were plotted on maps, there was no very clear pattern defined by where the victims lived. However, there was a very precise indication from their reported locations during working hours, that all of the victims had been directly downwind at the time of the release of the spores via [aerosol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulate "Particulate").[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdlovsk_anthrax_leak#cite_note-MMinterview-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdlovsk_anthrax_leak#cite_note-MSMperPB-5) Livestock in the area were also affected. It was revealed around this time that the accident was caused by the non-replacement of a filter on an exhaust at the facility, and though the problem was quickly rectified, it was too late to prevent a release. Had the winds been blowing in the direction of the city at that time, it could have resulted in the [pathogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen "Pathogen") being spread to hundreds of thousands of people. The military facility remains closed for inspection. Meselson's original contention for many years had been that the outbreak was a natural one and that the Soviet authorities were not lying when they disclaimed having an active offensive bio-warfare program, but the information uncovered in the investigation left no room for doubt.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdlovsk_anthrax_leak#cite_note-6)

Aftermath
---------

Russian Prime Minister [Yegor Gaidar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yegor_Gaidar "Yegor Gaidar") issued a decree to begin demilitarization of Compound 19 in 1992. However, the facility continued its work.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] Not a single journalist has been allowed onto the premises since 1992. About 200 soldiers with [Rottweiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rottweiler "Rottweiler") dogs still patrol the complex. Classified activities were moved underground, and several new laboratories have been constructed and equipped to work with highly dangerous pathogens.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdlovsk_anthrax_leak#cite_note-Shoham-7) One of their current subjects is reportedly _[Bacillus anthracis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_anthracis "Bacillus anthracis")_ strain H-4. Its [virulence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence "Virulence") and [antibiotic resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance "Antibiotic resistance") have been dramatically increased using [genetic engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering "Genetic engineering").[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdlovsk_anthrax_leak#cite_note-Shoham-7)\[_[failed verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")_\]
