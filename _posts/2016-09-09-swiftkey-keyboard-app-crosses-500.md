SwiftKey, the cult keyboard app on Android which introduced swipe-to-type on smartphones before it was copied by [most other competitors](https://beebom.com/swiftkey-alternatives-android-ios/), has crossed 500 million downloads on the Play Store. As pointed out by [Android Police](https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/12/15/swiftkey-keyboard-passes-500-million-installs-on-the-play-store/), the app is available as a pre-installed software on devices from some of the biggest Android vendors around the world, including Samsung and Huawei, contributing massively to its user base.  

Still considered to be one of the best and most feature-rich keyboard apps on both Android and iOS, SwiftKey is [now a Microsoft property](https://beebom.com/swiftkey-windows-10/), with the Redmond giant having acquired it in 2016 for a reported $250 million. It continues to be developed by the original team for the most part and, has introduced several new features since the acquisition, including an AI-based algorithm that the developers claim brings faster typing with more accurate auto-correct and helpful predictions.  

The latest version of the app on iOS also added a Voice Typing option and a trending GIFs section to the GIF panel. It also comes with a built-in adaptive emoji keyboard that learns the favorite emojis of users to predict their favorite emoticons for any conversation.  

SwiftKey may not be the only keyboard app to offer swipe-typing anymore, but it continues to remain one of the preeminent software in the segment on both Android and iOS. It offers a great experience to users, which is why it is still one of the most-used keyboard apps on smartphones, and it remains a favorite among users around the world. You can download SwiftKey from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkey) on Android or the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/swiftkey-keyboard/id911813648) on iOS.
