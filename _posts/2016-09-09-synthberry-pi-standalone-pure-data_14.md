We love everything synthesizer here, as well as everything Raspberry Pi. So the SynthBerry Pi is right up our alley. Room-sized modular synths are great, but here’s a teeny tiny standalone Raspberry Pi based synth – via [Synthopia](https://www.synthtopia.com/content/2020/02/01/synthberry-pi-a-standalone-pure-data-synth-based-on-raspberry-pi/)

> The SynthBerry Pi is a compact stand-alone synthesizer, capable of running patches created with Pure Data. Eight slide potentiometers are connected to the Raspberry to create a simple control surface that lets you control the sound synthesis parameters.
> 
> The video presents the SynthBerry Pi prototype and the sounds that can be created live through a Pd patch that lets you control three oscillators and a delay.
