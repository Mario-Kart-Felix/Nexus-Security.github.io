10Axis FeatherWing
------------------

By [Mark Aldritz Dela Virgen](https://hackaday.io/project/169044-10axisfeatherwing):

> This featherwing uses I2C to connect both the IMU (BNO055) and the altimeter (BME280) to the Feather. I made this to design projects that require a 10-DOF IMU in a tiny package where breakouts can affect the weight a lot and may not be a good option, such as a quadcopter, a model plane, or a model rocket.

nRF24L01+ FeatherWing Shield
----------------------------

By [Mitch](https://hackaday.io/project/169007-nrf24l01-feather-wing-shield):

> Now you can use your Feather board to make use of the nRF24L01+ 2.4ghz wireless module. It works great to create a wireless network for module-to-module data exchange. The nRF24L01+ is great at low power applications and running off a battery. The wing also features a switch to tie the nRF24L01+ IRQ pin to a input for interrupt use. It can be switched off to free up a GPIO if needed. Battery monitoring is essential in low power and remote communications so the wing incorporates a voltage divider for monitoring battery voltage to the Feather.
