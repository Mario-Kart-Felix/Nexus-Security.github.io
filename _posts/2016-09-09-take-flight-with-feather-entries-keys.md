Keys FeatherWing
----------------

By de∫hipu:

> Many Adafruit Feather boards are capable of simulating USB HID devices, like keyboards and mice. So why not have a shield that makes it easy to add a small macro keyboard to your computer? Or, you know, a set or really nice buttons with color LEDs to your project.

A²B Feather Wing
----------------

By David Knochenhauer:

> For my daily work at a big car manufacturer in germany there was the need to have a simple solution testing the A2B Audio Bus. The Feather ecosystem is a perfect match since we can combine several architectures with various programming styles.
> 
> A2B nodes can be either master or slave and they can be bus powered (slave nodes only) or local powered.  
> The first prototype will be a local powered node, which can be either master or slave. Next will be a phantom powered slave node, so you can provide power over the A2B bus.
