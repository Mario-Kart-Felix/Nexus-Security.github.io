The Open Book Feather
=====================

By [joey castillo](https://hackaday.io/project/168761-the-open-book-feather):

> The Open Book is an open-hardware device for reading books in all the languages of the world. It includes a large screen and buttons for navigation, as well as audio options for accessibility and ports to extend its functionality. Its detailed silkscreen, with the all the manic energy and quixotic ambition of a Dr. Bronner’s bottle, aims to demystify the Open Book’s own design, breaking down for the curious reader both how the book works, and how they can build one for themselves.

HMI FeatherWing
===============

By [bernhard](https://hackaday.io/project/169155-hmifeatherwing):

> The HMIFeatherWing gives you the possibility to easily add a HMI with a display and a joystick to your project. Just plug it on top of your Feather board and you can implement any HMI or menu structure you want.
> 
> The Feather Wing has a EA DOGM132-5 2.1″ display ([https://www.lcd-module.com/fileadmin/eng/pdf/grafik/dogm132-5e.pdf](https://www.lcd-module.com/fileadmin/eng/pdf/grafik/dogm132-5e.pdf)) with a ST7565 controller and 132 x 32 pixel. The feather wing allows to control the backlight with PWM so you can dimm it and turn it off and on. There exists versions of this display with black or blue color and even a transflective one which even works with or without backlight and is readable in full sun light. You can use any Arduino library for ST7565 controllers or my DogGraphicDisplay library: [https://github.com/generati](https://github.com/generationmake/DogGraphicDisplay)
