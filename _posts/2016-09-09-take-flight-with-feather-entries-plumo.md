Plumo-2D
--------

By [sparky-p32](https://hackaday.io/project/169027-plumo-2d):

> Plumo-2D is a development board for the Afero ASR-2D Secure WiFi/BLE radio architecture based on the ESP32 WiFi/BLE chipset. Plumo-2D is compatible with Adafruit Feather/FeatherWing form factor boards.This reference design is meant for customers to use for product prototyping and as a starting point for their own designs. The Plumo-2D uses the Espressif ESP32-WROOM-32D module + the Afero Hardware Security Module. Use of the pre-certified Espressif ESP32-WROOM-32D module gives the board FCC/IC, TELEC, and other certifications.For more information, please see the Afero developer site: https://ift.tt/1mYA8ou
