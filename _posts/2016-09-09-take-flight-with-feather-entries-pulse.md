WeatherWing SensorWing
----------------------

By Tim:

> (This) is a feather add-on board that has an AM2320 sensor for monitoring temperature and humidity. Also there is a photo/light sensor to monitor light level. Additionally I would like to also add a STEMMA connector for additional external sensor to connect to it such as a moisture sensor.
> 
> I have been wanting such a featherwing board with the feather format to easily plug onto a feather board that could connect to the internet to make a simple IoT weather machine.  Also with ability to add an external sensor for water/rain or soil moisture.  I think an addition of a STEMMA connector would do the trick.
