The Take Flight with Feather Contest is running from now to December 31st – [see all the details in the kickoff post](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/11/01/take-flight-with-feather-hackaday-hackadayio-digikey-feathercontest-adafruit/)!

We’re going to highlight [entries posted on Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/submissions/take-flight-with-feather/list) two at a time. Here are today’s entries:

RAD2 (Research Activity Detector version 2)
-------------------------------------------

By Lex Kravitz:

> The RAD2 (Research Activity Detector version 2) is a Feather compatible wing for sensing and logging motion.  It includes a built in low-power passive infrared (PIR) sensor, a microSD card slot for logging data, and real time clock (RTC) for accurate timestamping.  It also has 2 digital pins (A1 and A2) broken out to screw terminals for convenience and three signal LEDS for feedback.
> 
> The goals of this device are to:
> 
> 1.  Monitor motion via a PIR
> 2.  Keep accurate time
> 3.  Enable easy synchronization of additional datastreams with motion data
> 4.  Log data locally but enable wireless transmission
> 5.  Battery life of >1 month
> 
> This shield is an adaptation/improvement of the original [Rodent Activity Detector (RAD)](https://hackaday.io/project/160742-rad-rodent-activity-detector), adding a battery backed-up RTC, a built in PIR sensor, and a smaller form factor.  It is now compatible with the Adafruit Feather ecosystem for easily adding motion sensing and datalogging to their entire range of boards.  RAD2 was designed by [MCCI](https://mcci.com/) and [Lex Kravitz](https://hackaday.io/projects/hacker/294140).

SoundWing Audio I/O Board
-------------------------

By bobgreenwade:

> In from the microphone, out to the speakers… for any project that involves both microphone input and speaker output, this FeatherWing puts those two things conveniently on the same board. And if you only need one, well, at least you have the other without needing to wire up a breakout.
> 
> This is, essentially, two mono audio breakout boards on one FeatherWing. With this board, any of these functions (and sometimes more than one at the same time) can be either turned into or integrated into a Feather project:
> 
> *   Voice changer (for cosplay, primarily; fit the device inside a helmet, or in your pocket!)
> *   Voice amplifier for teachers and other small-room speakers, or those with certain medical conditions that result in an unusually quiet voice
> *   Two-way communicator (over wires, or whatever wireless protocol you deem best — LoRa, XBee, Bluetooth, etc.)
> *   Smart speaker (or interface with an existing smart speaker system)
> *   Hearing aid (probably with some extra features that can’t be found in commercial hearing aids, since those can fit inside your ear)
> *   Boom mike operator’s sound unit (in a film/TV setting)
> *   Parabolic microphone
> *   Myriad things I haven’t thought of yet!
