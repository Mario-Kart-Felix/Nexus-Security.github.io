The Take Flight with Feather Contest is running from **now to December 31st** – [see all the details in the kickoff post](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/11/01/take-flight-with-feather-hackaday-hackadayio-digikey-feathercontest-adafruit/)! Hurry, time is short!

**You still have time to get your entry in before the end of the month!**

We’re going to highlight [entries posted on Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/submissions/take-flight-with-feather/list) two at a time. Here are today’s entries:

LoRaWAN Feather
---------------

By Andy:

> A LoRaWAN Feather board based on the STM32L073 and DRF1262T radio module. Has all the awesome Feather features:  
> – USB  
> – LiPo charging  
> – I2C, SPI, UART, GPIO, Analog, DAC  
> – USER button and LED  
> With all the fun LoRaWAN features  
> – STM32L073 and SX1262 supported configuration for the Semtech LoRaWAN reference  
> implementation  
> With awesome upgrades!  
> – Efficient DC-DC buck/boost converter  
> – SWD connector  
> – Builtin LiPo Fuel Gauging  
> – Hardware support for a hard secure element
> 
> Designed to be machine built. Most of the PCB is, in fact, designed around the JLC SMT parts library.

Watt-A-Live INA209 Power Monitor Shield Wing
--------------------------------------------

By MagicWolfi:

> Yes, we want to keep the Watts alive and not kill them (if you know what I mean ;).
> 
> The Watt-A-Live is a versatile embedded power monitor based on the Texas Instruments INA209 with full connectivity to the unit under test. It measures the load current through a shunt resistor and has separate GND connections to the power supply and the load to make it a true power monitor.
> 
> It is designed as an Adafruit Feather Wing and Arduino Shield. Alternatively it can be used as a breakout board with any other controller that has I2C and optional GPIO connectivity. 2 jumpers can select between 2 different shunts to measure different current ranges.
> 
> The new version board is populated with a 0.05 Ohm shunt to measure 6.4A to 200µA. Optionally a 4.99 Ohm shunt can be added for a current range of 64mA to 2uA. Maximum bus voltage is 26V.
> 
> An Arduino library is provided to access all registers and measurements, a demo sketch shows how to print data through the serial console easily.
