The Take Flight with Feather Contest is running from now to December 31st – [see all the details in the kickoff post](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/11/01/take-flight-with-feather-hackaday-hackadayio-digikey-feathercontest-adafruit/)!

We’re going to highlight [entries posted on Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/submissions/take-flight-with-feather/list) two at a time. Here are today’s entries:

AD9833 Waveform Generator FeatherWing
-------------------------------------

[Cedar Grove Studios has entered](https://hackaday.io/project/168261-ad9833-waveform-generator-featherwing) an intriguing FeatherWIng with a waveform generator on it.

> The AD9833 Waveform Generator FeatherWing is an Adafruit Feather-compatible module. The Waveform Generator produces an op-amp buffered sine, triangle, or square wave output with a practical frequency range of approximately 0 to 300KHz with 0.1Hz resolution.
> 
> Frequency accuracy and stability is determined by the on-board 25MHz +/- 100ppm crystal oscillator. Output signal peak-to-peak amplitude is adjustable with a maximum unipolar output of slightly less than 3.3 volts.  
> Waveform Generator control is via the Feather SPI bus and a custom CircuitPython AD9833 driver. The wing derives its power from the host Feather’s 3.3V power.

Cedar Grove Robot Friend FeatherWing
------------------------------------

[Another from Cedar Grove](https://hackaday.io/project/168428-cedar-grove-robot-friend-featherwing) (note: you can enter an unlimited number of unique designs as you want).

> Perched on the top of a robot chassis, the Cedar Grove Robot Friend FeatherWing passively connects the FeatherWing connections of a PyBadge or PyGamer device with a Crickit FeatherWing. The Crickit provides 3.3V power to the attached PyBadge or PyGamer. All Feather signals are interconnected to accommodate custom alterations to the Crickit module, such as support for IRQ/Busy or sensor modifications.
> 
> The Cedar Grove Robot Friend includes a prototype area and a breakout of all Feather pins for further cusomization.
> 
> For use ONLY with the Crickit FeatherWing and compatible Feather MCU boards. To date, the prototype has only been tested with the PyGamer and PyBadge. Double-check pin compatibility if you plan to attach or stack other Feather devices.
