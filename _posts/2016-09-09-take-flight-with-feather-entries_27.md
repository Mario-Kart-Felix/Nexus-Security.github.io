The Take Flight with Feather Contest is running from now to December 31st – [see all the details in the kickoff post](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/11/01/take-flight-with-feather-hackaday-hackadayio-digikey-feathercontest-adafruit/)!

We’re going to highlight [entries posted on Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/submissions/take-flight-with-feather/list) two at a time. Here are today’s entries:

GearsNGenes ADS1115 FeatherWing
-------------------------------

By GearsNGenes:

> This device adapts the Adafruit Industries’ ADS1115 IC to the Feather form factor. The purpose of this device is the same as its predecessors: to convert analog voltage into a digital signal (called an AD Converter or ADC). In addition to converting between the type of signal, this FeatherWing can amplify the magnitude of the voltage it reads, as well.
> 
> Predominantly, I have used this FeatherWing to develop my own device that I have called the E.M.F. Meter, an educational tool that can be used to perform hands-on experiments in circuit analysis or in electromagnetism.
> 
> Ultimately, the goal of this FeatherWing is to assist in building complex circuits with little to no soldering. In a world where technology is being built around the feather, it is important that the shape and connectivity of the hardware match. Thus, I built a shield that matches the shape of the Feather so that it is easy to integrate into larger circuits.

Sensing and display FeatherWing
-------------------------------

By CaptMcAllister:

> This FeatherWing can measure numerous parameters and display them on the e-ink display or send the information back through the Feather wireless link.
> 
> This FeatherWing was designed to monitor HVAC system parameters.  It can measure airflow, humidity, and temperature, and it has terminal block connections that can be used for analog inputs or as outputs.  The data can be displayed on an integrated e-ink display.  We have built and tested units, and they are working well.
