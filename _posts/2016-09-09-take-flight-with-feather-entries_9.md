The Take Flight with Feather Contest is running from **now to December 31st** – [see all the details in the kickoff post](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/11/01/take-flight-with-feather-hackaday-hackadayio-digikey-feathercontest-adafruit/)!

**You still have time to get your entry in before the end of the month!**

We’re going to highlight [entries posted on Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/submissions/take-flight-with-feather/list) two at a time. Here are today’s entries:

Biodata Sonification Feather
----------------------------

By samuel.cusumano:

> By translating microcurrent fluctuations occurring across the surface of a plant’s leaf, this device generates MIDI notes allowing a user to listen into the invisible biological processes occurring within a plant. Originally built as the MIDI Sprout, then later as a biodata wifi daughter board for the Adafruit Circuit Playground, this is the continued evolution of my educational biodata sonification project. By using the Adafruit Feather ecosystem, biodata can be translated into serial MIDI, Bluetooth MIDI, WiFi MIDI, or even directly into musical sounds!
> 
> Based on a simple 555 timer circuit set as astable multivibrator, tiny changes in electrical conductivity are measured and turned into variable width pulses which are read by the microcontroller and changes are detected in code turning on LEDs and producing MIDI notes and control changes.
> 
> Listen in on the secret life of plants, and understand how your tools work!

HEGduino
--------

By Joshua Brewster:

> A revolutionary new biofeedback method – now open sourced for the ESP32!
> 
> HEG stands for Hemoencephalography – the measure of blood flow in the brain. This is intricately involved in brain activity and consciousness – and it turns out you have direct control!
> 
> Until now it’s never been affordable or accessible to experience this unique yet simple tool. Light penetrates through our skull easily so we can use pulse oximetry to measure the surface blood flow information in your brain! It turns out stress and poor health have huge impacts on our brain’s blood flow activity and can straight up shut parts of itself down in response. Our frontal cortex also increases blood flow activity when we are focused. The HEG allows us to make basic measures of this and more! We are building a full web based suite to go with it – for free!
