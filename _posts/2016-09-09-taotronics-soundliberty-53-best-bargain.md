TaoTronic’s [previous truly wireless earbuds](https://www.reviewgeek.com/15714/taotronics-wireless-earbuds-the-best-cheap-truly-wireless-earbuds/) were already better than you can expect for $45. The company’s new [SoundLiberty 53 earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PB2586P?tag=reviewgeek-20) sound better, last longer, and fit more comfortably—all for the same low price.

TaoTronic’s older, TT-BH052 truly wireless earbuds use Bluetooth 5.0 for long-range. They work in either dual- or single-bud mode and come with a case that charges your phone or other devices. And anyone can get behind a case that charges your earbuds 40 times.

They aren’t flawless, though. The sound is acceptable, at best, the case is bulky, and the fit isn’t perfect. Even with a tight seal, they occasionally fall out of my ears.

The newer SoundLiberty earbud set solves all of that. They sound better, last longer, fit more comfortably, and come with a slimmer case. But there are still a couple of sacrifices.

Decent Sound
------------

Earbuds are only as good as they sound. Other features don’t matter if you can’t stand to listen with them.

The SoundLiberty earbuds sound pretty good. Of course, they aren’t as amazing as my wired headphones or my [$500 Nuheara wireless earbuds](https://www.reviewgeek.com/16525/nuheara-iqbuds-boost-review-potentially-life-changing/). However, if anything that costs $45 is as good as something that costs $500, someone is charging the wrong price.

The thing you miss most with this earbud set is bass; it’s there, but it’s not (in any way) a thumping good time. However, there’s a noticeable improvement over the previous TaoTronics set—they sound much better, and that’s at least partly because there’s more bass.

If you typically purchase the cheapest earbud set and are happy with how those sound, you’ll be satisfied with this set, too. If you prefer something incredibly accurate and thumping, these will leave you wanting. But again, that’s to be expected given the price.

Five Hours of Music
-------------------

The other big question when it comes to truly wireless earbuds is how long they last—and that’s another significant improvement in this new set. While the old [TaoTronics TT-BH052](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H2JNFYZ/?creativeASIN=B07H2JNFYZ&tag=reviewgeek-20) earbuds quit after just two or three hours, the new set lasts five to six. I usually want to hear what’s going on around me while I work, so I use them in single earbud mode. When one dies, I switch to the other, so they usually make it through my work shift. They recharge in less than two and a half hours.

The new TaoTronics case is noticeably smaller than the old one. Josh Hendrickson
