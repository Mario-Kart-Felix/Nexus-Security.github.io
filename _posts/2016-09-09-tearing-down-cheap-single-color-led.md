I love it when people post a project they’re working on or a tear down they’re trying to figure out on social media and other makers lend a hand in offering advice and figuring things out. Such was the case [recently on Twitter](https://twitter.com/GeekMomProjects/status/1221955348648480768) when Debra of [Geek Mom Projects](http://www.geekmomprojects.com/) posted a video of a cheap LED matrix bracelet and wondered if it was hackable.

As she began posting images of her tear down and what she was finding, other people began sharing what they knew. Someone even helpfully [unrolled the thread](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1221955348648480768.html) via a thread reader.
