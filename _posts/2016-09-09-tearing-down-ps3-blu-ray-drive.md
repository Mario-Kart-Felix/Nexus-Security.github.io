Optical drives are somewhat passe in 2019, with most laptops and desktops no longer shipping with the hardware installed. The power of the cloud has begun to eliminate the need for physical media, but that doesn’t mean the technology is any less marvellous. \[Leslie Wright\] and \[Samuel Goldwater\] took a deep dive into what makes the PS3’s optical drive tick, [back in the heyday of the Blu Ray era.](http://repairfaq.cis.upenn.edu/Misc/Blu-ray/site1/index.html)

The teardown starts by examining the layout of the assembly, and the parts involved. This is followed by a deep dive into [an exploration of the triple-laser diode itself](http://repairfaq.cis.upenn.edu/Misc/Blu-ray/site1/diode.html), There are tips on how to safely extract the delicate parts, which are highly sensitive to electrostatic discharge, as well as exhaustive specifications and measurements of performance. There’s even [a break down of the optical package, too](http://repairfaq.cis.upenn.edu/Misc/Blu-ray/site1/optics.html), including a patent search to shed more light on the complicated inner workings of the hardware.

And if this lures you to dig deeper into [Sam’s Laser FAQ](http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/lasersam.htm), prepare to spend the rest of the week.

We’ve seen other optical teardowns before, too – [like this look inside a stereo microscope.](https://hackaday.com/2017/04/03/stereo-microscope-teardown/) It’s quite technical stuff, and may fly over the heads over the optically inexperienced. However, for those in the know, it’s a great look at the technology used in a mass-produced console.
