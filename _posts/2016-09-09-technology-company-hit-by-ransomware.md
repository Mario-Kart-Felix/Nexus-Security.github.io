Virtual Care Provider Inc, a Wisconsin based technology company that provides cloud data hosting, security, and access management to more than 100 nursing homes was hit by a ransomware attack carried out by Russian hackers. The involvement of Ryuk encryption prevented access to crucial medical records of the patients and administration data related to the medication. After encrypting all the data hosted by the company for its patients and clients, attackers demanded a $14 million ransom in bitcoin in turn for a digital key that would unlock access to the data. Unable to afford the ransom, the company owner said that she is fearful of the consequences of the incident which could lead to the premature death of certain patients and the shutdown of her business.  
  
Reportedly, the ransomware was spread via a virus known as 'TrickBot', the company told that it is 'feverishly working' to regain access to crucial data. The officials estimated that about 20% of the company's servers were compromised during the attack.  
  
In a letter addressed to the company's clients, obtained via the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Christianson and Koch said that VCPI is "prioritizing servers that provide Active Directory access, email, eMAR, and EHR applications. We will be communicating status updates often and transparently, and, in preparation for service restoration, recommending to you the most efficient manner for your users to regain authenticated access."  
  
Operated by WIZARD SPIDER (eCrime group), Ryuk is a targeted, well-planned and sophisticated ransomware that has targeted large organizations, primarily those that supply services to other businesses. It is employed to target the enterprise ecosystem and has mainly focused on wire fraud in the recent past. Despite having relatively low technical abilities and being under constant development since its release in August 2018, Ryuk has successfully encrypted hundreds of systems, storage and data centers in all the companies it attacked.  
  
VCPI chief executive and owner Karen Christianson said, “We have employees asking when we’re going to make payroll,” “But right now all we’re dealing with is getting electronic medical records back up and life-threatening situations handled first.”  
  
“We’ve got some facilities where the nurses can’t get the drugs updated and the order put in so the drugs can arrive on time,” she further told. “In another case, we have this one small assisted living place that is just a single unit that connects to billing. And if they don’t get their billing into Medicaid by December 5, they close their doors. Seniors that don’t have a family to go to are then done. We have a lot of \[clients\] right now who are like, ‘Just give me my data,’ but we can’t.”
