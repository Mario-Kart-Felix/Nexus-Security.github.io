Aidan and Caroline Jackson

This 17-year-old gamer in the United Kingdom was given the medical attention he needed thanks to his online friend calling for paramedics from 5,000 miles away.

Earlier this month, Aidan Jackson had been playing video games from his bedroom in Widnes, England while his parents watched television downstairs. He had been playing with his 20-year-old friend Dia Lathora from Texas when he suddenly started to make sounds of what she could “only describe as a seizure”.

When Dia started asking her friend if he was okay, she heard no response—so she immediately began scouring the internet for the correct emergency phone number in the English town.

After Dia finally settled on dialing the non-emergency law enforcement number, she forced herself to stay calm and could explain to the dispatcher that she was calling from America to help her UK friend.

Minutes later when paramedics arrived on Aidan’s street, his parents assumed that they were headed to a different household.

“We were at home watching TV and Aidan was upstairs in his room. The next thing we noticed was two police cars outside with flashing lights,” Aidan’s mother Caroline Jackson told [_The Liverpool Echo_](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/exclusive-boy-having-seizure-home-17541818). “I assumed they were in the area for another reason and then they ran up to the front door.

“They said there was an unresponsive male at the address. We said we hadn’t called anyone and they said a call had come from America. I immediately went to check on Aidan and found him extremely disorientated.”

The teen has since undergone a number of tests in order to determine the cause of the seizure. Since this is the second time in one year that Aidan has suffered from a fit, his parents are extraordinarily grateful for Dia’s actions.

“Dia had our address, but didn’t have any contact numbers, so it was amazing she managed to get help from so far away,” Jackson told the news outlet. “I’ve spoken to her and expressed our thanks—she’s just glad she could help.

“We always say to the kids, be careful who you speak to online, but in this case, it was invaluable.”
