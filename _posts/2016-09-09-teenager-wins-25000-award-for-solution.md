[Via CNN](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2019/11/06/us/teenager-invention-blind-spot-trnd/index.html), 14-year-old Alaina Gassler of West Grove, Pennsylvania has won a [$25,000 Samueli Foundation Prize](https://www.societyforscience.org/content/ssp-blog/middle-schoolers-invention-seeks-correct-blind-spots-wins-25000-top-award-national-broadcom-masters) for creating a prototype designed to eliminate a car’s blind spots.

> “Congratulations to Alaina, whose project has the potential to decrease the number of automobile accidents by reducing blind spots,” said Maya Ajmera, President and CEO of the Society for Science & the Public and Publisher of _Science News_. “With so many challenges in our world, Alaina and her fellow Broadcom MASTERS finalists make me optimistic. I am proud to lead an organization that is inspiring so many young people, especially girls, to continue to innovate.”

Gassler’s project uses a webcam, projector, 3D printed adapter and retroreflective fabric to make a car’s A-pillars (the A-pillar design in a car supports the windshield and provides protection in case of a crash) invisible by displaying the image of the blind spot behind them onto the pillar.
