Did researchers just discover Big Bang Jr? The article [Discovery of a Giant Radio Fossil in the Ophiuchus Galaxy Cluster](https://www.icrar.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2002.01291.pdf) from the Astrophysical Journal finds remnants of a _large_ bang.

Via [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-51669384):

> Scientists have detected evidence of a colossal explosion in space – five times bigger than anything observed before.  
> The huge release of energy is thought to have emanated from a supermassive black hole some 390 million light years from Earth.

> “I’ve tried to put this explosion into human terms and it’s really, really difficult,” co-author Melanie Johnston-Hollitt told BBC News.
> 
> “The best I can do is tell you that if this explosion continued to occur over the 240 million years of the outburst – which it probably didn’t, but anyway – it’d be like setting off 20 billion, billion megaton TNT explosions every thousandth of a second for the entire 240 million years. So that’s incomprehensibly big. Huge.”
