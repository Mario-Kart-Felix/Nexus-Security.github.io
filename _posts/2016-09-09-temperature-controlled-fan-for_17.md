> Keep your Pi cool by having it turn on a fan whenever it gets hot.
> 
> I have a Raspberry Pi (RPi) dedicated to controlling my 3D printer using OctoPrint ([https://octoprint.org/](https://octoprint.org/)). Since printing can sometimes run for hours, I wanted some active cooling on my pi, but only when the RPi exceeds a set temp.
