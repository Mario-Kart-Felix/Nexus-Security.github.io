> For a fully immersive VR experience, one piece of equipment which still hasn’t become widely available is a haptic glove which can provide tactile feedback to let users ‘feel’ virtual environments. Now, the company working on a full-body VR suit has announced a VR-powered glove, the Teslasuit Glove, which can detect movements of the wearer’s hand and provide tacticle feedback.
> 
> The new glove can be used in combination with the suit or separately, and Teslasuit says it integrates “haptics, motion capture, biometry and force feedback” to enable users to feel virtual textures. It could potentially be used for tele-control systems or for medical rehabilitation, and the company claims it can gather real-time data so could even be used to monitor users’ stress levels or heart rate.
