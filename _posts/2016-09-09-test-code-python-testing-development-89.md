[Test & Code – Python Testing & Development 89: Improving Programming Education – Nicholas Tollervey](https://testandcode.com/89).

Nicholas Tollervey is working toward better ways of teaching programming. His projects include the Mu Editor, PyperCard, and CodeGrades. Many of us talk about problems with software education. Nicholas is doing something about it.

*   [Code With Mu](https://codewith.mu/) — a simple Python editor for beginner programmers.
*   [Made With Mu](https://madewith.mu/) — A blog to celebrate projects that use the Mu Python code editor to create cool stuff.
*   [PyperCard](https://pypercard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) — Easy GUIs for All.
