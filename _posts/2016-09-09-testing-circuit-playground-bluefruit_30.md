Tryin’ out latest TestFlight of the Bluefruit Connect app – we’ve added a tool to transfer images from your phone or tablet. I can send an image from my photo roll or even take a lovely selfie to transmit. We did a lot of work to get images transferring at a nice speed. We’ll release this soon so people can try it out with the TFT Gizmo + Circuit Playground bluefruit ([video](https://youtu.be/m4YP_bH8ayA)).
