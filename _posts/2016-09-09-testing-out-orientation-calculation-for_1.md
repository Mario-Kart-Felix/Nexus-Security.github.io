Testing out orientation calculation for Feather Bluefruit Sense ([video](https://youtu.be/8VGNQJG2DoE)). Last week we did a couple guides on calibrating sensors. This week we’re taking that calibrated data and putting it through some filters to create orientation data. We’re using PJRC’s orientation visualizer which is an easy way to see which way the board is oriented – nice and stable.
