Over the weekend we wrote a plotter/scope for the [CLUE in Arduino](https://youtu.be/Nz38vF2W8BI) â€“ you can plot any of the built in sensors (light, temperature, pressure, humidity, color, proximity, accel, gyro, mag) all directly on the 240Ã—240 display. we even added auto-scaling! this makes it really easy to test out the sensors and measure the world around us ![ðŸ™‚](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png) [Code on GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Arcada/blob/master/examples/full_board_tests/arcada_clue_sensorplotter/arcada_clue_sensorplotter.ino).
