Testing out the TensorFlow micro speech demo on Adafruit CLUE ([video](https://youtu.be/Cq7NlKXDy_s)). Only took us a few minutes to compile our TF Lite micro demo from the Circuit Playground Bluefruit over onto the CLUE board. It uses the same nRF52840 chipset and PDM microphone – worked well out of the box! With all the sensors on CLUE it will make for a good platform to try out various sensor-learning projects!

What is CLUE?

> we wanted to build some projects that have a small screen and a lot of sensors. this board has a 1.3″ 240×240 ips tft display, two buttons, and a ton of sensors:
> 
> lsm series 9 dof motion, apds9960 light/color/proximity, pdm microphone, humidity, temperature and barometric environmental sensing.
> 
> there’s a qwiic/stemmaqt connector for adding more sensors like pm2.5 air quality and others that were too big to fit on the board.
> 
> we’ll be primarily using circuitpython for programming it, but it will also work in arduino. and of course, we’d love to see makecode on it!
> 
> after designing it, the board was close enough to micro:bit-shape-size that we moved a few parts to make it fit in micro:bit robots and some projects – the nrf52840 is a big upgrade chip and can do stuff like tensorflow lite for microcontrollers, ble central and peripheral, and more.
