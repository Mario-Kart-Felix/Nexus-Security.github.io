Testing out an upcoming STEMMA GPS board for STEMMA SUNDAY – ([video](https://youtu.be/JhquVC3RbZU)). This little board holds a PA1010D GPS module with I2C and UART interface. It has a built in antenna as well, so cute! Here’s the tester we designed to check all elements of the hardware so we know every GPS we make works.

> WHAT IS STEMMA? STEMMA is not an original idea, we’re working within an ecosystem of many other plug and play systems. We started [STEMMA in 2014](http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=86384236&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch), and intended to be compatible with Grove only (cause that’s all that existed at the time) but then when Qwiic came around in 2017, added a smaller connector so we could work with those parts too!
> 
> **STEMMA attempts to be as cross-compatible as possible with both Grove and Gravity** (compatible connectors & 3-5V power/logic). STEMMA QT is cross-compatible with Qwiic - STEMMA QT connector/cable is same as Qwiic. You can use STEMMA QT devices with Qwiic devices/controllers.
