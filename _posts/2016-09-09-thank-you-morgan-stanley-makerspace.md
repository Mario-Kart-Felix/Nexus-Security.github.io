The Morgan Stanley Technology team [recently](https://twitter.com/MorganStanley/status/1231217016985604098) hosted teens from [Women In Need](https://winnyc.org/) to teach them coding fundamentals using the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express. Participants created light sensors, accelerometers and more as part of the Morgan Stanley Makerspace Program. Morgan Stanley is a supporter of NYC’s largest provider of shelter and supportive housing for homeless families. Vadaparty gave us some additional information as well –

My son grew up working on the fruits of Adafruit – from 7th grade through 12th and got into Georgia Tech ([last post from high school](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=57&t=155907&p=768952&hilit=sidharta+vadaparty#p768952).He taught at local STEM clubs, formulated curriculum, etc.) Seeing this success, I started a “Morgan Makerspaces” at Morgan Stanley with an intent to teach under-served communities through Morgan’s philanthropy division. What started as a small group effort grew into a large-scale success – [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6639578721319743488/). Thought all the readers and folks @adafruit would enjoy! Presently children of New York’s Women in Need shelters are receiving this education! I am personally grateful to Lady Ada’s unstoppable good work! I think Adafruit’s equipment help us all – kids of all ages, people of all backgrounds.”_
