Valentine’s Day is the time to show your significant other how much they mean to you. However, if they’re not a fan of chocolate, flowers, or other traditional Valentine’s Day gifts, maybe video game-themed Valentine’s Day gifts would be more fitting.

If you’re in a relationship with someone who loves video games, you have tons of fun gift options to choose from. Here are some great Valentine’s Day gifts for gamers!

1\. A New Multiplayer Game

What’s a better gift for a gamer than a new game to enjoy? Getting one that you can play together is even better, and you have plenty of great picks to choose from.

[Snipperclips](https://www.amazon.com/Snipperclips-together-Nintendo-Switch-Digital/dp/B06X9YMLHP) is a fun, low-stress puzzle game where you team up to solve paper-based puzzles. [Mario Kart 8 Deluxe](https://www.amazon.com/Mario-Kart-8-Deluxe-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B01N1037CV) is a fantastic kart racer that’s fun for all skill levels. And competitive couples can duke it out for hours in [Super Smash Bros. Ultimate](https://www.amazon.com/Super-Smash-Bros-Ultimate-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B01N5OKGLH).

Funko Pops aren’t the highest-quality figures available, but they’re inexpensive and cute, so they make great gifts. Above is [a figurine of Crash Bandicoot](https://www.amazon.com/Funko-POP-Games-Bandicoot-styles/dp/B0759HS8HD) as an example, but you can find characters from pretty much every game imaginable.
