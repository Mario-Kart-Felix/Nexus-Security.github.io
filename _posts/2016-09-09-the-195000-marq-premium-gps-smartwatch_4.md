> Whether you answer the call of duty or are inspired by those who do, MARQ™ Commander is here to help you accomplish your mission. No other modern tool watch with smart features offers dual-format GPS coordinates, built-in topographical maps and a UTC bezel for unparalleled situational awareness. Night vision goggle compatibility and Jumpmaster functions let you deploy at a moment’s notice. And a diamond-like carbon coated titanium case with knurled details allows you to move undetected in the shadows. Finally, the operator who serves with honor and dignity has a watch that does, too.
