A conscientious shopper knows that monitoring Amazon’s price history is an essential part of getting a good bargain. Sellers are renowned for bumping their prices up so they can offer faux “discounts” a couple of weeks later, especially ahead of big events like Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday.

Thankfully, it’s quite easy to see an Amazon item’s price history. Several different Amazon price trackers are available.

Here are five of the best Amazon price watch services that you should be using.

1\. [CamelCamelCamel](https://camelcamelcamel.com/)
---------------------------------------------------

CamelCamelCamel is arguably the most popular Amazon price history tool. The free service lets you see the price history for any product listed on the local Amazon sites in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, and China.

To search for a product, you just need to paste its URL or Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN) into the search box. You can also perform a keyword search, enabling you to see how similar products’ prices have compared over time.

Displayed on each item’s page is a comprehensive price history chart, tracking not only Amazon’s price but also third-party new and used prices. You can tell the chart to display a range of one, three, or six months, or a year.

CamelCamelCamel also lets you create alerts. If a price hits a certain threshold, you can get a notification via email or on Twitter.

And its Firefox and Google Chrome extensions can put a Track Product button right on the pages of retailers for easy access to CamelCamelCamel’s price history charts. The extension is called The Camelizer.

2\. [Keepa](https://keepa.com/)
-------------------------------

The Keepa Amazon price history tracker lets you access data in a few countries that CamelCamelCamel does not support—namely, Mexico, India, and Brazil. It does not, however, let you check Amazon’s price history in China.

Keepa provides an Amazon price tracker extension for more browsers than CamelCamelCamel. In addition to Firefox and Chrome, there are also extensions for Microsoft Edge and Opera.

When you check the price history, you will see a graph plotting the changes over time. The graph also shows other important aspects, such as whether there was a Lightning Deal at the time, or whether shipping fees were included in the price of the product.

3\. [The Tracktor](http://thetracktor.com/)
-------------------------------------------

Another Amazon price history tracker worth checking out is The Tracktor. It works with local Amazon sites in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, and Japan.

The Tracktor has a couple of unique features that help to differentiate it from the other price watch tools on this list.

*   **Firstly**, there’s the Movers tab. It lets you see which products on Amazon have seen the largest price increases and decreases over the previous day. You can filter by new or used products and can sort the products by price or by percentage change.
*   **Secondly**, check out the Trending tab. It shows the most popular products that other users have on their personal tracking lists. You can see which products are trending right now, and which are the most tracked overall.

Finally, The Tracktor provides an extension for Chrome and Firefox. At the time of writing, however, the Firefox extension is undergoing a complete overhaul and is unavailable for download. The developers do not offer a timescale for the expected completion date.

4\. [Honey](https://www.joinhoney.com/)
---------------------------------------

Honey is a popular browser extension for saving money online. Its primary purpose is to search for (and automatically add) coupon codes to your shopping baskets whenever you check out from more than 40,000 online retailers.

However, it also has a tool called Amazon Best Price. It has three features to help you make sure you’re always getting the best deal:

*   **Seller Comparison**: Popular Amazon products are often available from dozens of different sellers. Honey will scan all the sellers and let you know which one is offering the best deal. It can even take your Amazon Prime shipping benefits into account when performing the analysis.
*   **Price History**: Honey provides an Amazon price watch graph. It is available for 30, 60, 90, or 120 days.
*   **Droplist**: Droplist is a watchlist. Add items to it, and Honey’s Amazon price watcher will let you know if the cost moves up or down.

Honey is available on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge. Unfortunately for international users, it only works on the Amazon US version of the site.

5\. [Waatcher](https://waatcher.com/)
-------------------------------------

According to [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-price-changes-2018-8), Amazon prices change 2.5 million times every day. As such, a typical product will see its price change every 10 minutes, even if it’s only by a couple of cents.

Clearly, nobody has the time to track Amazon prices that often, so how do you make sure you never miss out on a bargain? Waatcher is one solution worth checking out. It’s an Amazon price tracker that can automatically purchase an item on your behalf whenever your target price is reached.

All you need to do is set the maximum amount that you’re willing to for a listing. Waatcher will then monitor the Amazon item’s price history and alert you as soon as the price is hit. If you allow it to, the tool will place an order immediately.

You probably won’t want to use a tool like this all year. In its literature, the company says it can take months to place some orders. It would be easy to forget that you set something up, then receive a nasty shock when your credit card bill arrives. Where Waatcher excels is for making sure you get the best possible deals on the big sales days of the year.

To start using Waatcher Amazon price tracker to bag bargains automatically, you need to grant the app access to your Amazon account. Some people might be uncomfortable with that situation from a privacy and security standpoint.
