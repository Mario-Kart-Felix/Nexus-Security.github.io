Wouldn’t it be nice to have a clean, organized trunk that’s easy to dig through? One that doesn’t throw your groceries around like a primitive beast? It might sound impossible, but a simple trunk organizer can solve these issues.

Trunk organizers are similar to [toolboxes](https://www.reviewgeek.com/9711/the-best-toolboxes-for-any-garage/) and closet organizers. They give you a place to put all your car-junk, so everything stays clean, tidy, and easy to find. And since they don’t move around too much, trunk organizers are also great for holding fragile items, like groceries, antiques, or catered food for dinner parties.

The case for a trunk organizer is pretty clear, but every trunk is different. Some are small, some are large, and some (truck beds) are routinely exposed to the hellish forces of nature.

So, we’ve found the best trunk organizers for every type of car, and we’ll explain why each might be right for your vehicle.

Best Overall: FORTEM Waterproof Organizer

FORTEM

The [FORTEM waterproof trunk organizer](https://www.amazon.com/Organizer-FORTEM-Collapsible-Foldable-Waterproof/dp/B071DTXSTZ/?tag=reviewgeek-20) is a great option for just about any vehicle. It’s a two-foot-long, collapsible box with three compartments, large mesh pockets, adjustable straps, and a detachable lid (so you can keep its contents private).

Plus, it’s waterproof, so you can use it in a truck bed for things like groceries—although, you’ll probably want to keep it folded up inside your truck so it stays clean.
