Regardless of your hiking experience, hiking apps are essential for navigating, planning, or discovering new outdoor trails. Plus, they’re cheaper than [standalone GPS units](https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-GPSMAP-High-Sensitivity-GLONASS-Receiver/dp/B00HWL9BQ4/?tag=reviewgeek-20). But which app should you get? Here are the best hiking GPS apps available today.

Cairn

Cairn is one of the best safety-oriented hiking GPS apps. Like other hiking apps, Cairn allows you to see, create, and follow trails (and even has offline maps). But it also has cell-coverage maps that can help you avoid dead-zones, live tracking that shows your location to friends, and automated messages to emergency contacts if you get lost.

The Cairn hiking app is totally free on iOS and Android, which is surprising when you consider its offline maps and unique safety features.

The AllTrails app is a great all-in-one outdoors app for hikers, runners, cyclists, and nature-enthusiasts. At a basic level, it’s a GPS app with pre-set maps and trails.

AllTrails works well as a free app, but some Pro features (like offline maps, weather overlays, and emergency contacts) [cost $30 a year](https://www.alltrails.com/pro/signup).
