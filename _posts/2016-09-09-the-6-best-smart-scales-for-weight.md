Losing weight can be a challenging endeavor, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be done. If you’re beginning your weight loss journey, a good smart scale that can track your progress and sync automatically to your phone or computer will help you stay on track and complete your goals.

What to Look for in a Smart Scale
---------------------------------

Before you decide on a scale to track your progress, you should consider what you’re looking for, and what’s the difference between a smart scale and a dumb scale?

*   **Compatibility: **One of the most important features on a smart scale, is the ability to sync with different apps and upload your weight-tracking data. There are a plethora of different apps that scales can sync to, so you want to make sure the one you buy is compatible with everything you use.
*   **Measurements:** The scale you buy obviously must be able to measure your body weight, but many scales also offer a variety of other body composition measurements, like body fat, BMI, muscle mass, and even bone density. Sometimes these extra measurements can be less than accurate though, so it’s always important to take everything not directly related to your weight with a grain of salt. If you’re serious about monitoring body fat, you should look into getting [fat calipers](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/tools/measure-bodyfat) or a [DEXA scan](https://www.dexafit.com/services/dexa-scan) for a more accurate picture of your body.
*   **Accuracy and precision:** Scales need to be precise AND accurate. To track your progress efficiently and stay on a weight-loss schedule, you need to be sure the weight you’re reading is correct and not off by a half-pound or more.
*   **Extra features: **Lots of smart scales also offer extra features. There are pregnancy trackers that will keep track of your baby as it grows inside (or outside of) you and many scales also use saved user profiles, so the whole family can track their weight.

Remember: Scales can only be as accurate as you let them be. If you’re having issues with the scale incorrectly reading your weight and fluctuating wildly, it likely just needs to be recalibrated. Just like you would zero or tare out a kitchen scale, these scales need to be retold what their starting weight is every time you move it around.

You should also use the scale on a level surface. Differences in elevation will cause discrepancies in your weight because the force of gravity weighing you down is now being dispersed in the horizontal direction, too, which the scale’s sensors can’t account for.

For best results, weigh yourself at the same time each day—preferably in the morning before breakfast. This way, you’re getting the most accurate look at your true weight every time you weigh in.
