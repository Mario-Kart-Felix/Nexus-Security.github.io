Although music is an aural experience, it can be complemented by visuals too. For example, a live music event will always have a light show incorporated into the performance. Music players on our computers often come with visualizers as well, which adapt to the music.

The [Nanoleaf Rhythm Edition Smarter Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Nanoleaf-Rhythm-Smarter-Kit-NL28-2003TW-9PK/dp/B079FZGZS4/) is a great way to add music visualization to your experience. These smart lighting panels can be mounted on any wall around your home. The lights can be purchased independently, but the Rhythm module adds sound sensors that pick up any audio playing and adjust the lights in time with the music.

As with many smart lights, the Nanoleaf work with Apple Homekit, Google Assistant, Alexa, and IFTTT. This kit comes with all the parts you need to get started, including the Rhythm module, nine lighting panels, nine mounting stencils, and 28 mounting strips.

These lights are a great addition to any music lover’s home, but the feature-packed device could be a great gift for anyone. To find out more about their capabilities, check out [our review of the Nanoleaf Rhythm](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/nanoleaf-rhythm-review/).
