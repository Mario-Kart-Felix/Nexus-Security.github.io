The PlayStation 4 has a great range of games and an equally impressive range of controllers for playing them. Whether you’re looking for something that’s more affordable than the official controller, or you want to splash out for a more luxurious model, there are plenty of options for you to choose from.

Here are the best PS4 controllers available today.

1\. [Sony DualShock 4 ](https://www.amazon.com/DualShock-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-Black-4/dp/B01LWVX2RG/)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Sony DualShock 4](https://www.amazon.com/DualShock-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-Magma-4/dp/B01MD19OI2?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01MD19OI2) [Sony DualShock 4](https://www.amazon.com/DualShock-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-Magma-4/dp/B01MD19OI2?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01MD19OI2) [Buy Now On Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/DualShock-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-Magma-4/dp/B01MD19OI2?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01MD19OI2)

The [Sony DualShock 4](https://www.amazon.com/DualShock-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-Black-4/dp/B01LWVX2RG/) is the official controller for the PlayStation 4. As such, it’s a perfect choice if you don’t want to gamble with third-party controllers. If you’re concerned that an unofficial controller won’t have Bluetooth compatibility or work on PC, you’re better off getting the official one to make absolutely sure it has all the features you need.

The main problem with the DualShock 4 is its high price. Third-party manufacturers have pushed down the price for a PS4 controller, which leaves the official controller high up in the cost rankings. However, the additional expense is worth the peace of mind that it will work right out of the box.

2\. [Etpark PS4 Wireless Controller](https://www.amazon.com/Etpark-Controller-Playstation-Professional-Vibration/dp/B07VRCWMV7/)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Etpark PS4 Wireless Controller](https://www.amazon.com/Etpark-Controller-Playstation-Professional-Vibration/dp/B07VRCWMV7?SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07VRCWMV7) [Etpark PS4 Wireless Controller](https://www.amazon.com/Etpark-Controller-Playstation-Professional-Vibration/dp/B07VRCWMV7?SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07VRCWMV7) [Buy Now On Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Etpark-Controller-Playstation-Professional-Vibration/dp/B07VRCWMV7?SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07VRCWMV7) $26.99

The [Etpark PS4 Wireless Controller](https://www.amazon.com/Etpark-Controller-Playstation-Professional-Vibration/dp/B07VRCWMV7/) aims to be as close to the real thing as possible. It has wireless compatibility, a headphone jack, and even a light bar that mimics the official controller’s style. All this comes in at a more agreeable price than buying a controller from Sony.

It also has some additional tweaks over the official controller. For instance, the grips around the bottom of the controller go further up this model. It also has a sleek light bar separating the grips from the controller, which makes it look very stylish. The controller’s main downside, however, is how they handled the right-sided buttons.

Third-party controllers can’t re-use the official symbols, as they’re copyrighted. Some choose to use their own symbols, which somewhat mimic the official controller in shape and color. This makes it easy for someone not familiar with the console to understand what button they’re pressing. The Etpark, however, chooses to keep these buttons blank, meaning a newcomer to the gaming scene won’t know what to press.

3\. [KINGEAR Game Controller](https://www.amazon.com/Controller-KINGEAR-Wireless-Playstation-Vibration/dp/B07MXGKNKV/)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[KINGEAR Game Controller](https://www.amazon.com/Controller-KINGEAR-Wireless-Playstation-Vibration/dp/B07MXGKNKV?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07MXGKNKV) [KINGEAR Game Controller](https://www.amazon.com/Controller-KINGEAR-Wireless-Playstation-Vibration/dp/B07MXGKNKV?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07MXGKNKV) [Buy Now On Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Controller-KINGEAR-Wireless-Playstation-Vibration/dp/B07MXGKNKV?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07MXGKNKV) $34.99

If you’d like something that’s close to the official PS4 controller, the [KINGEAR Game Controller](https://www.amazon.com/Controller-KINGEAR-Wireless-Playstation-Vibration/dp/B07MXGKNKV/) is a good choice. To start, it has face buttons that accurately represent the game controls while also looking stylish in its own right. It can also connect to PC and PS3 consoles, which is a good feature if you’re looking for a cross-platform controller.

Its rubber grips and lightweight design make it a fine choice if you’re looking for something comfortable to hold. Its biggest drawback is its high price, which almost rivals that of the official controller. As such, it won’t make a good purchase if you’re trying to save money. If you want something a little different from the official controller, however, you won’t go wrong with this one.

4\. [ISHAKO Double Shock PS4 Controller ](https://www.amazon.com/ISHAKO-Controller-Wireless-Playstation-Bluetooth/dp/B07V3DW4WQ/)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[ISHAKO Double Shock PS4 Controller](https://www.amazon.com/ISHAKO-Controller-Wireless-Playstation-Bluetooth/dp/B07V3DW4WQ?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07V3DW4WQ) [ISHAKO Double Shock PS4 Controller](https://www.amazon.com/ISHAKO-Controller-Wireless-Playstation-Bluetooth/dp/B07V3DW4WQ?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07V3DW4WQ) [Buy Now On Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/ISHAKO-Controller-Wireless-Playstation-Bluetooth/dp/B07V3DW4WQ?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07V3DW4WQ) $39.98

Looking for something with a little more flair? Try the [ISHAKO Double Shock PS4 Controller](https://www.amazon.com/ISHAKO-Controller-Wireless-Playstation-Bluetooth/dp/B07V3DW4WQ/). It comes in two styles, both of which are inspired by space and galaxy imagery. They look fantastic, and will surely stand out from the official range of plain-colored controllers.

Unfortunately, it doesn’t use face buttons that translate to the official controls, and it’s quite expensive too. As such, this controller is best for someone who’s an avid gamer and wants something more than just a default controller.

5\. [TERIOS Wireless Controller](https://www.amazon.com/TERIOS-Wireless-Controller-Built-Jack-Integrated/dp/B07R2881R9/)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[TERIOS Wireless Controller](https://www.amazon.com/TERIOS-Wireless-Controller-Built-Jack-Integrated/dp/B07R2881R9?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07R2881R9) [TERIOS Wireless Controller](https://www.amazon.com/TERIOS-Wireless-Controller-Built-Jack-Integrated/dp/B07R2881R9?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07R2881R9) [Buy Now On Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/TERIOS-Wireless-Controller-Built-Jack-Integrated/dp/B07R2881R9?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07R2881R9) $29.99

If you’re after the sleekest controller on the market, it’s hard to beat the [TERIOS controller](https://www.amazon.com/TERIOS-Wireless-Controller-Built-Jack-Integrated/dp/B07R2881R9/). It uses a modern, smooth design in different colors, so you can choose the one that calls to you the most. It also has additional buttons for easier gameplay, such as L3 and R3 buttons on the back. Its ergonomic design and materials make it a comfy fit within your hands.

The TERIOS can be connected wirelessly, but it has spotty performance. As such, this controller is best used when you wire it directly into the console. Despite this, its competitive price makes this controller a solid choice for those on a budget.

6\. [Pirahna Performance Chrome Gold PS4 Controller](https://www.amazon.com/Chrome-Playstation-Wireless-Custom-Controller/dp/B07D8YDFB1/)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Pirahna Performance Chrome Gold PS4 Controller](https://www.amazon.com/Chrome-Playstation-Wireless-Custom-Controller/dp/B07D8YDFB1?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07D8YDFB1) [Pirahna Performance Chrome Gold PS4 Controller](https://www.amazon.com/Chrome-Playstation-Wireless-Custom-Controller/dp/B07D8YDFB1?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07D8YDFB1) [Buy Now On Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Chrome-Playstation-Wireless-Custom-Controller/dp/B07D8YDFB1?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07D8YDFB1) $79.95

If you’re on the hunt for something even better than the official PS4 controller, the [Pirahna Performance controller](https://www.amazon.com/Chrome-Playstation-Wireless-Custom-Controller/dp/B07D8YDFB1/) is your best choice. Pirahna Performance takes Sony’s DualShock 4 controllers and modifies them to look amazing. As a result, when you buy one of these controllers, you get all the functionality and reliability of an official product, while also having that unique flair that comes with buying a third-party model.

Of course, for this product model to be profitable, the controllers have to be sold at a higher price than Sony’s own. However, if you’re looking for a premium controller either for yourself or a loved one, it’s worth the extra money!

7\. [ROTTAY Wired PS4 Controller](https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Playstation-Professional-Gamepad-Joysticks/dp/B07P3GVF3X/)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[ROTTAY Wired PS4 Controller](https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Playstation-Professional-Gamepad-Joysticks/dp/B07P3GVF3X?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07P3GVF3X) [ROTTAY Wired PS4 Controller](https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Playstation-Professional-Gamepad-Joysticks/dp/B07P3GVF3X?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07P3GVF3X) [Buy Now On Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Playstation-Professional-Gamepad-Joysticks/dp/B07P3GVF3X?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAIO22DD3AFUSKXUKQ&tag=makeusw-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07P3GVF3X) $17.99

If you don’t mind sacrificing a few features for a great price, try the ROTTAY Wired Controller. As the name suggests, it has no wireless functionality and has to be plugged into the console directly. It also doesn’t have a gyro, a touchpad, or an audio jack.

However, if you don’t mind the exclusion of these features, there’s a lot to love. The 6.5-foot cable is longer than the official DualShock’s USB cord, making it perfect for stretching all the way to the couch. Its stylish buttons and sleek design make it very aesthetically pleasing.

Finally, the ROTTAY controller is one of the cheapest on the market. For the same price as an official controller, you can buy multiples of the ROTTAY. This makes it a great choice for expanding a controller collection for friends and family to play along, all without breaking the bank.
