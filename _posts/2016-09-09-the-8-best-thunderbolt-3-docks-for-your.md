It helps save space on your desk as the dock is available for use in either a horizontal or vertical orientation.

Along with a DisplayPort on the rear, there’s an additional Thunderbolt 3 port to daisy chain another dock or connect another device. A Gigabit Ethernet connection lives next to four USB-A 3.0 ports for other peripherals. On the front of the dock is a single USB-A 3.0 port and a headphone jack.
