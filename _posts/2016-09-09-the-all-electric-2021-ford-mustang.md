As you'd expect, Ford has kept an extremely tight lid on the project through its entire development, and its official details have been limited to a few silhouetted images, a promised EPA-rated range of 300 miles on a charge, and an on-sale date of "late 2020." But other items of interest have leaked out—its highest-performance variant is rumored to do 0-60 mph in 3.5 seconds. We also know it will come with [a rear-wheel-drive-only option](https://www.thedrive.com/news/30485/retracted-leak-says-mustang-inspired-electric-ford-suv-will-be-rear-drive-launch-in-late-2020).

Of course, naming a five-passenger crossover SUV the "Ford Mustang Mach-E" has already raised the hackles of those who see it as a dilution of an iconic brand. But it's been an inevitability for a while now. Electrification is the future, and with Ford pruning its product line to trucks, SUVs, and the Mustang, it was only a matter of time before a Mustang crossover was birthed. As CEO Jim Hackett's first start-to-finish project since he joined the company in 2017, the Mach-E is a clear statement of purpose from an organization that's been criticized by investors for not taking bolder steps in this moment of change.

But that doesn't matter to normal people—what matters is whether or not the Ford Mustang Mach-E is good enough to stand up to the expectations baked into both its powertrain and name. Check back here at 9:30pm ET/6:30pm PT to find out.
