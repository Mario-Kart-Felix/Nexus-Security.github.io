Over on the [MicroPython forums](https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?t=7333), the Ant Team posted about their board they made with their milling machine, the Arcobaleno ([video](https://youtu.be/vV_R-Mp-2kI)) ‚Äì

> _‚ÄúWe are The Ant Team and we designed a MicroPython compatible board to check the capabilities of our PCB milling machine, The Ant. Likely, we will use our board and MicroPython for future projects, we enjoy using it ![üôÇ](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png) The board is open and shared with the ‚ÄúCC Attribution 3.0 Unported License‚Äù. This is an image of the Arcobaleno prototype board milled, soldered and tested with MicroPython. In this video and in its description there are all the info about it. And in the Arcobaleno repository you will find all the project files. Thanks to Damien George for creating MicroPython and to all the community that develops and supports it. Tell us what you think about it.‚Äù_
