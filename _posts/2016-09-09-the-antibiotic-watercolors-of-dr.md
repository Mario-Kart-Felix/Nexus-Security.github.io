> “One day, out of sheer curiosity, I dipped a paintbrush directly onto an actinorhodin droplet and realized how similar it was to watercolour paint,” \[Dr. Vineetha\] Zacharia says, explaining that the discovery became the inspiration for a new creative outlet. Today, this antibiotic is the basis of most of her artistic work. She calls these vibrant paintings “Actino Art.”
> 
> Zacharia has also experimented with actinorhodin’s pH-responsive properties to change her paintings’ colours. Under basic pH levels (ammonia is a basic solution, for example), the antibiotic is blue, but at acidic pH levels (e.g. vinegar), it becomes red. On her [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ActinoArtist) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/actinoart/) accounts, she has demonstrated this characteristic by adding dilute acetic acid to [turn a blue painting red](https://twitter.com/ActinoArtist/status/1096135045545263104).
