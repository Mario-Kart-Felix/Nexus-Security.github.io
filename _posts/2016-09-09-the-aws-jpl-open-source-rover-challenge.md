[A contest](https://spacechallenge.tech/) to use machine learning to autonomously operate the virtual Open-Source Rover created by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to explore the surface of Mars.

From December 2 – February 21, 2020 (24:00 PST) | VIRTUAL HACKATHON | 18+ Only

The Challenge
-------------

Build and train a reinforcement learning (RL) model on AWS to autonomously drive JPL’s Open Source Rover between given locations in a simulated Mars environment with the least amount of energy consumption and risk of damage.

> You will use AWS RoboMaker for the simulation and Amazon SageMaker to build and train your RL model.
> 
> We have published all the resources you need to get started in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Christopheraburns/AWS-JPL-OSR-Challenge.git), including a reference architecture, detailed instructions to set up your simulation and machine learning environments, a virtual model of JPL’s Open-Source Rover, and the simulated Mars world. You will submit your trained RL model along with your code.
> 
> We will evaluate all submitted models based on the weighted score and choose the top scoring submissions as winners. The highest scoring solution will also be incorporated into the JPL Open-Source Rover project for future builders to use!

The grand prize is $15,000 USD, second place $5,000.
