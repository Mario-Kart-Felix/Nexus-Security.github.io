The Battle of Polytopia An Epic Civilization War MOD (Unlocked) APK For Android

The battle of Polytopia has begun. Take your civilization to war in this low poly turn-based strategy game. Venture into this world of blocks: explore, gather resources, close, extract ore ... Build an empire of epic proportions, train your warriors and send them to fight with armies of other civilizations.

A new version of the classic 4X strategy game with beautiful low poly art.

Choose between different tribes to elevate your civilization, each with technology unlocked from the start.

An epic turn-based empire builder of automatically generated cards made of blocks where you have to think and fight each turn. Each game will be a new experience with unlimited replay value.

Unlike other long-lived 4X or RTS games, The Battle of Polytopia has a dynamic approach to the genre: a deep layer of strategy where the last battle of the war will take place fairly quickly. In solo mode, the goal of the game is either to obtain the highest possible score in 30 turns (Perfection), or to destroy all the opposing forces (Domination). In multiplayer, the goal is either to be the first to reach 10,000 points (Glory), or to wage war and conquer all rival capitals (Might). Attack and exterminate all civilizations on the way to work or school! End the war before lunch! Win by conquest or gain by crafting, research and develop your faction more than anyone or a mixture of both.
