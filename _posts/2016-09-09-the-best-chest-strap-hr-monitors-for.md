While fitness trackers are all the rage, an older gadget might be a better help if you’re looking to hit your fitness goals: a [chest band heart rate tracker](https://www.reviewgeek.com/22588/a-heart-rate-band-might-be-a-better-choice-than-a-fitness-tracker/). They’re cheaper, more accurate, and rarely need a battery change.

These are more niche athlete gadgets and can’t easily be found on the shelves of Best Buy or Academy. But for those who want a simple and effective way to get super-accurate heart rate data, they can’t be beaten. We’ve selected the best on the market.

Wahoo

For anyone who wants to make the switch to a chest strap heart rate monitor without breaking the bank, the [Wahoo TICKR](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00INQVYZ8/?tag=reviewgeek-20) is the best option. This super-simple tracker runs on a cheap watch battery for months (or even years), and connects to most exercise equipment via the ANT+ wireless standard, with Bluetooth available as a backup for most phone exercise apps. (Wahoo makes its own app, but the tracker works with almost any app that supports external hardware.)

Its simple hardware and snap-on, adjustable strap are just about foolproof. It helps that it’s tiny: The low-profile tracker can easily fit underneath even tight workout clothes. For an accurate upgrade without the frills, you can’t do any better.

Polar

Runners and cyclists adore the Polar H10, thanks to measurement accuracy that consistently beats the competition. Its electrocardiogram sensor, waterproof design, and dual Bluetooth and ANT+ connectivity (both at the same time, if you need it) means it can be used in almost any situation.

The user-replaceable battery is rated for 400 hours of active tracking, and it can save a workout session in local memory if you don’t have your phone or tracking gadget handy. It also works on the semi-proprietary 5 Khz “Gymlink” wireless standard. And yes, despite the Polar branding, the H10 is more than happy to work with third-party apps.
