Pull-up bars are a great way to exercise your upper body and core, using only your body weight. Most bars can also be used for a variety of other exercises like push-ups, sit-ups, and dips.

What to Look for in a Pull-Up Bar?
----------------------------------

Pull-up bars are a great tool to build strength, but before you decide on one to purchase, you should consider what your needs are.

*   **Size:** One of the most important things to do before purchasing a pull-up bar is making sure that it’s going to fit where you want to use it. Some doorways are too small or large to support a pull-up bar properly. So, if you have a non-standard door frame, make sure the one you buy is going to fit.
*   **Grip: **There are many different ways to use a pull-up bar to work out different areas of the body. The direction you grip the bar, and the distance between your hands significantly change the workout you’re getting. Pull-up bars with multiple grip areas maximize the muscles you can work out with the equipment.
*   **Comfort:** You’re going to be hanging your entire body from the bars. The contact points should not only be comfortable, but they need to be easy to grip. You don’t want to be slipping off like it’s a carnival game.

The Best for Most People: Perfect Fitness Multi-Gym Pro

Perfect Fitness

The Perfect Fitness Multi-Gym Pro is an excellent product with three different grip positions—narrow, wide, and neutral. On top of the three kinds of pull-ups that you can do with this product, it is designed so that if you place it on the floor of a doorway, it can be used to support sit-ups, dips, and push-ups, giving you a wide variety of options to get your exercise in.

The Multi-Gym Pro fits in most standard doorways ranging from 26 to 33-inches and can be constructed in a couple of different ways. There are multiple holes in the bars at different lengths, so that even if your molding is larger than usual, you can extend the bar down further into the doorframe to make sure that it will fit properly. The flat padding surface distributes the weight of your body more evenly onto your door’s frame, preventing indentation and markings after long term use that other models with round supports might leave. This also allows the ends of the pull-up bar to double as an extra-wide grip without the need for a weaker, secondary bar.
