### 1\. Asus VivoBook 14 Core i3 7th Gen

As for the internals, the laptop packs 7th-gen Intel Core i3 processor coupled with 4GB of RAM. **The best part about this laptop is that it comes with 256GB of SSD storage** instead of a slower hard disk drive. Basically, it means you will have a much better performance due to the faster storage. Besides that, you have a Full HD LED screen and a fingerprint sensor to boot.
