If you’re a comic book fan who loves Marvel and love your smartphone, here are the best Marvel apps and games you need to install on your smartphone.

Marvel Comics was founded in 1939, meaning it’s been around for over 80 years. Whether you’re a longtime fan or have discovered the characters recently, this article is for you.

1\. Marvel Unlimited
--------------------

Avid comic book readers should already be aware of Marvel Unlimited, the Netflix for Marvel comics. By paying a small monthly fee, you’ll have access to a wide variety of comic books, from the latest Spider-Man issue to the iconic Infinity Gauntlet saga from 1991. And the best part is that they all live in your pocket.

There are also lots of new comics being added on a frequent basis, so if you somehow get tired of the 25,000+ issues available in Marvel Unlimited, there are always more on the way.

**Download:** Marvel Unlimited for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/marvel-unlimited/id607205403) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marvel.unlimited&hl=en_US) (Free, subscription available)

2\. MARVEL Battle Lines
-----------------------

MARVEL Battle Lines is an epic card game based off of your favorite Marvel heroes and villains. Captain Marvel, Dr. Doom, Thor, you name it—they’re all here and ready for battle.

In Battle Lines’ single player mode, you can embark on an adventure to protect the universe from evil and collect new cards as you go. And in online PvP, you can face off against fierce opponents using the deck you’ve built.

There are more than 300 cards to acquire, with even more being added through regular updates. We strongly recommend MARVEL Battle Lines for fans who like a good strategy game with lots of content.

3\. Marvel: Color Your Own
--------------------------

While it may seem child-like at first glance, it really isn’t. Marvel: Color Your Own is a sensational experience for people of all ages.

After a long day of stress, it’s a great way to unwind. There’s a wide gamut of brush types and colors to help you personalize your favorite Marvel heroes. And it can be a worthwhile educational experience for creative beginners looking to become more experienced when it comes to drawing on a device.

If you want to customize your favorite superhero, learn a bit about digital art, and relax a little, Marvel: Color Your Own is a great app to download.

4\. Avengers: Endgame Stickers
------------------------------

iPhone users: If you want to add a little super-heroic pizzazz to your iMessage conversations, Marvel’s official Avengers: Endgame sticker pack has got you covered. It features a bunch of adorable stickers, including an inspired Captain America, a motivational Black Widow, and a sassy-as-always Rocket Raccoon.

And of course, when you’re feeling arrogant or cocky, a snappy mini-Thanos is at your disposal. Just be careful to not erase half the universe when using him.

**Download:** Avengers: Endgame Stickers for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/avengers-endgame-stickers/id1458556514) ($1.99)

5\. MARVEL Strike Force
-----------------------

MARVEL Strike Force is an awesome strategy RPG that lets you assemble a huge array of mighty superheroes and villains.

Your task in Strike Force is to form your own collective to combat an assault from another world. This time around, the good and the bad team up. Characters such as Venom, Deadpool, and Dr. Strange join you in the fight against an all-new evil.

Strike Force has six different game modes to choose from; Arena, Blitz, Raids, Alliance War, and Challenges. Unfortunately, there’s no online mode, but we’ll let this omission slide as the existing modes are lots of fun. All in all, this is a great game for Marvel die-hards.

6\. MARVEL Puzzle Quest
-----------------------

If you’re a fan of Candy Crush and Bejeweled, you’re going to love Marvel Puzzle Quest.

Marvel Puzzle Quest is a unique RPG built around a simple and fun Match-3 game mechanic. As you match tiles, characters attack and perform epic special moves. Keep racking up the matches, and you’ll be victorious in no time.

But don’t get too arrogant. Whether you’re playing as Star-Lord, Loki, or Luke Cage, Puzzle Quest gets super challenging and dials up the difficulty as you move forward. Not to mention, there’s an online mode with over 15 million players, so you’re sure to find some competition.

7\. LEGO Marvel Super Heroes
----------------------------

It’s a big download, coming in at 2GB, but it’s well worth it. LEGO Marvel Super Heroes: Universe In Peril features an action-packed, goofy, LEGO-ified Marvel story.

In order to stop a sinister alliance of super-villains from destroying the Earth, you must help the Avengers get through a variety of platforming stages to acquire the legendary Cosmic Bricks. But it’s not just the Avengers you can play as; there are more than 90 playable mini-figure heroes to choose from.

And if you don’t have an internet connection at hand, that won’t stop you from taking down evil. You can play LEGO Marvel Super Heroes even without Wi-Fi.

**Download:** LEGO Marvel Super Heroes for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lego-marvel-super-heroes/id737006024) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.lego.marvel&hl=en_US) ($4.99)

8\. Marvel Contest of Champions
-------------------------------

If you’re like the Hulk, and just want to punch and destroy everything in your way, you should consider Marvel Contest of Champions.

Contest of Champions is a fierce fighting game in which the most powerful superheroes, anti-heroes, and villains in the universe face off in an intergalactic tournament. It’s easy to get the hang of the battle mechanics with its fun and intuitive touch controls.

It isn’t all about fighting, though; there’s an element of strategy. You have to collect, upgrade, and carefully manage your teams of fighters to ensure victory, whether it be in single-player or online mode.

Overall, we strongly recommend Marvel Contest of Champions for fans of brawlers like Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter, and Injustice.

9\. Disney+
-----------

Disney+ is Disney’s streaming video service in the same mold as Netflix and Hulu. This is the new home of Marvel movies such as Avengers: Endgame, Captain Marvel, Thor, and Iron Man 3.

Eventually, all Marvel Cinematic Universe films will be streamable from Disney+, alongside other content. Disney and Marvel are planning to release original series based on MCU characters, like Loki, WandaVision, and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.

It’s safe to say that Disney+ is a must-have for anyone who calls themselves a Marvel fan.
