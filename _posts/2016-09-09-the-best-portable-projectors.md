Whether you’re giving a corporate presentation or you just want to lie in bed and play Mario Kart on your ceiling, a good portable projector will let you turn virtually any surface into a screen for all kinds of media.

What Should You Look for When Buying a Portable Projector?
----------------------------------------------------------

Projectors can be fairly expensive and come in a wide variety of options, so it’s important to consider what you need your projector to be able to do for you.

*   **Picture quality:** Just like a TV, the image created by projectors varies in quality, and there are different kinds of projectors displays. The three main types of projectors are DLP, LED, and LCD. DLP projectors generally look sharper and are better with colors but usually need a darker room. LCD and LED projectors, however, can show clear images even in bright rooms and are typically much quieter. There are also laser projectors, which are the best of the best and their price tags definitely reflect that; they are brighter, clearer, and more expensive.
*   **Keystone adjusting:** The angle the projector is at and the type of surface you’re projecting on can greatly distort the image. Usually, it’ll make the screen look more like a trapezoid than a rectangle. All projectors should have a way to fix this by adjusting the angle the beam comes out, horizontally and vertically, to account for the distortion.
*   **Brightness:** Projectors work best when they are used in dark rooms, but obviously you’re not always going to have the perfect conditions. The brightness of the projectors bub, measured in lumens, will give you a decent idea of how well the projector will work under all kinds of conditions. The more lumens, the brighter the image.
*   **Viewing distance:** You’ll want to consider the setting where you’re most likely going to use the projector and how far you’ll need the image to reach. Projectors are [made to project an image only so far](https://www.howtogeek.com/400252/how-much-space-do-you-need-for-a-home-theater-projector/) away before it begins to get blurry and out of focus.
*   **Input sources:** Every projector should be able to use HDMI and USB as an input; some also have more options like cable antennas, USB-C, and the ability to cast from a phone or computer.

The Best Choice for Most People: Anker Nebula Mars II
-----------------------------------------------------

Anker

If you’re looking to purchase a portable projector, the Nebula Mars II is the best thing on the market. Its interface uses Andriod 7.1, which provides a sleek experience that allows you to use all sorts of streaming apps and even wirelessly cast from your phone or tablet. Of course, it also comes with USB and HDMI compatibility, making it the complete package. The Mars II can operate for up to four hours on a single charge, letting you watch basically any movie or give a presentation without having to plug into an outlet.

The image on this thing is as great as its connectivity features. The Mars II uses a DLP projector that has a beautiful picture ranging from 30-150 inches in size depending on how far it is from the projection surface. It has a one-second auto-focus that will give you a crisp image you don’t have to manually adjust, and then after it also allows vertical and horizontal keystone adjusting to make sure its HD picture is squared up and not distorted. Portable projectors have never looked so good.

The Budget Pick: Anker Nebula Capsule
-------------------------------------

Anker

Projectors are usually very expensive products, even smaller portable ones. If you’re on a budget but still want to take your presentations with you everywhere you go, the Nebula Capsule is an affordable option that will allow you to do just that. Another solid product from Anker, this projector is the size of a can of Coke but still packs quite a punch. The DLP projection isn’t as bright as the Mars II, but it gives a clean image that can display at up to 100 inches. The focus needs to be manually adjusted, but the Capsule makes it an incredibly easy thing to do. It also runs on Andriod 7.1 allowing you to download streaming apps and screencast while also having the standard HDMI and USB ports. You can take this thing with you anywhere, and it only weighs 15 ounces so it won’t hold you down.
