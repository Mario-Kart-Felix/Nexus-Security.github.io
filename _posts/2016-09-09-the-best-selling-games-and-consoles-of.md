The NPD Group has released its [monthly games report](https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1195121530360852480?s=20) for October 2019, revealing which games and consoles sold the best in the United States throughout what is traditionally one of the most prolific months of the calendar year.

Hardware, software, and accessories combined to generate $1.03 billion in spending, running behind October 2018's $1.57 billion. NPD analyst Mat Piscatella surmises that this is because fewer big games were released this October, with [Call of Duty: Modern Warfare](https://www.gamespot.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare/) also launching two weeks later in the month than last year's [Call of Duty: Black Ops 4](https://www.gamespot.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-4/). Despite this drop-off, however, October 2019 still holds the second-highest total for an October this decade.

Hardware sales continue last month's decline, dropping 41% compared to October 2018. This is expected with both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One coming to the end of their life cycles. $182 million was spent on hardware during the month, but the Nintendo Switch did see some growth. Nintendo's machine was the best-selling console in October once again, and is still the best-selling console so far this year.

In terms of software, October saw $620 million in spending, a 37% drop compared to last year. Unsurprisingly, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was the month's best-selling game for the 12th year in a row, while also exceeding every other 2019 release to claim its crown as the year's best-selling game so far.

New IP [The Outer Worlds](https://www.gamespot.com/the-outer-worlds/) performed well during October, landing at No. 2, with [Luigi's Mansion 3](https://www.gamespot.com/luigis-mansion-3/) taking third among all formats. Nintendo's [Ring Fit Adventure](https://www.gamespot.com/ring-fit-adventure/) also broke into the top 10.
