Most SBCs run Linux operating systems well. However, some single-board computers offer Android and Chrome OS compatibility. Lets take a look at the best single-board computers for installing Android and Chrome OS.

Why Buy a Single-Board Computer?
--------------------------------

A single-board computer typically comes at a lower cost than purchasing a larger motherboard. This comes, partially, from the bundled components. It’s a computer that’s operational out-of-the-box. Just add an operating system and storage media, and you’re good to go.

Also, because SBCs use fewer circuit boards, the cost remains low. Along with the low price, SBCs have a low power draw in comparison with full-fledged PCs. However, a single-board PC lacks the computing power of a traditional desktop or laptop. As such, many SBCs struggle with computationally heavy tasks such as emulating PlayStation 1 or Nintendo 64 games.

Finally, SBCs typically lack the upgradeability found on larger circuit boards. For example, on a Raspberry Pi 4, you cannot upgrade the RAM, CPU, or GPU. Nevertheless, single-board PCs are an ideal project PC for everything from a retro gaming console to a smart home hub, to a low-power home theater PC (HTPC), a personal server cluster, and much more.

How to Run Android or Chrome OS on an SBC
-----------------------------------------

To run Chrome OS or Android on an SBC, you need a few things. First, a compatible single-board computer. If you’re using Chrome, you’ll need Chromium OS. Chromium OS is an open-source operating system that brings Chrome OS to single-board computers.

Unfortunately, Chrome OS is relatively resource-heavy. It runs slowly, even on the Raspberry Pi 4’s upgraded 1.5GHz processor and 4GB RAM. Still, Chromium OS brings the lightweight, browser-based operating system to SBCs.

Several options allow you to run Android on an SBC. On the Raspberry Pi and Odroid, you can use RTAndroid. Other boards, such as the Banana Pi, utilize images available on the Android and SBC downloads page. Phoenix OS and Remix OS bring Android to x86 devices, allowing users to build a do-it-yourself Android PC.

Want to get started? Here are the top single-board computers for running Android and Chrome OS.
