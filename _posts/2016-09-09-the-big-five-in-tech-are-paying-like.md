I saw [this tweet](https://twitter.com/GatorsScott/status/640865339320999936) about your chances of making it into the NFL so I wanted to run a similar chart of stats to see what it’s like to make it into the top echelons of the software industry.

*   Total people in CS: [1,256,200](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm)
*   College CS majors: [55,000](https://danwang.co/why-so-few-computer-science-majors/)
*   % CS Grads who stick it out: [64%](https://datausa.io/profile/cip/110701/)
*   CS grads per year: [35,329](https://datausa.io/profile/cip/110701/)
*   % of CS grads to FAANG: [0.2%](https://qz.com/285001/heres-why-you-only-have-a-0-2-chance-of-getting-hired-at-google/)
*   People who make it into FAANG per year: [12,500](https://qz.com/285001/heres-why-you-only-have-a-0-2-chance-of-getting-hired-at-google/)
*   % of FAANG engineerins who make it to Staff level or greater: [15%](https://www.quora.com/How-does-Googles-internal-levels-work)
*   People who make it to Staff engineer at Google per year: [1,875](https://www.quora.com/How-does-Googles-internal-levels-work)
*   Average income of a Staff engineer at a FAANG: [$506,000](https://www.levels.fyi/SE/Google/Facebook/Amazon)
*   Income after taxes: [$292,400](https://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/tax-brackets.aspx)

Comparing this to [professional sports starting salaries](https://cashmoneylife.com/how-much-does-a-professional-benchwarmer-earn/)

*   NFL = $465,000
*   MLB = $507,500
*   NBA = $582,180
*   NHL = $650,000

This doesn’t account for the many non-rookies who spend years playing part-time or in the minor leagues, particularly in the MLB, NHL, and MLB. For example, there are a [dozen or so NBA players](https://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/players.html) making less than your _average_ engineer in a major metro area like Silicon Valley or Boston.

What am I getting at? **A staff engineer at Google or Facebook stands to make more than the rookies in the NFL and MLB**. We are officially in an era where the top software engineers are being paid like the top sports players. What a time to be alive!
