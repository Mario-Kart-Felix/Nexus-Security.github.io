[The Boy Scouts of America Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy](https://www.bsarestructuring.org/press_release/boy-scouts-america-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy/) –

> Scouting programs, including unit meetings and activities, council events, other Scouting adventures and countless service projects, will continue throughout this process and for many years to come. The BSA fully intends to maintain its commitments to its members, families, volunteer leaders, employees, retirees, donors and alumni to the fullest extent permitted by bankruptcy laws.
