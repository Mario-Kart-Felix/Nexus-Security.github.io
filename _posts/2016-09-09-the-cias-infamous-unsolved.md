> Almost exactly 30 years ago, the artist and sculptor Jim Sanborn was devising an encrypted code for his sculpture complex at the new CIA headquarters.
> 
> The centerpiece of the complex, called [Kryptos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kryptos), is an eight-foot tall sculpture of a copper scroll, with four paragraphs of letters cut from the metal. At first glance, the letters seem to be gibberish. But cryptologists, including NSA experts and the American scientist James Gillogly, gradually decrypted the first three paragraphs of the text. But the full solution has eluded cryptographers, and the 74-year-old Sanborn has just [released a new clue](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/29/climate/kryptos-sculpture-final-clue.html) in order to help hobbyists solve it.
