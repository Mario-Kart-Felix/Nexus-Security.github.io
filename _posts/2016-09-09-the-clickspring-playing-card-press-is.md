We have no idea what a playing card press is, nor do we care. All we know is that after [watching \[Chris\] from Clickspring make his playing card press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PwAQZNLy0I), we want it.

Digging a little deeper, \[Chris\] offered to make this card press for \[Chris Ramsay\], a magician who specializes in cardistry, or the art of illusions with cards. The feel of playing cards is crucial to performing with them, and a card press keeps a deck of cards in shape. Not a commonly available device, \[Clickspring Chris\] designed one in an elaborate style that brought in elements from \[Chris Ramsay\]’s logo.

And those snakes! Made from brass rod and bent into shape by hand, they wrap around the side supports to form \[Chris Ramsay\]’s logo. All the brass ended up gold plated, while all the screws ended up with [a heat-blued finish](https://hackaday.com/2016/03/23/metal-magic-heat-bluing-steel-clock-hands/). Settle in and enjoy the video below.

It’s been a while since [the Clickspring skeleton clock](https://hackaday.com/2016/12/06/for-your-binge-watching-pleasure-the-clickspring-clock-is-finally-complete/) was finished, in which time \[Chris\] has been working on a reproduction of [the Antikythera mechanism](https://hackaday.com/2015/11/23/the-antikythera-mechanism/). His video output slowed considerably, though, when he made a new finding about the mechanism, an observation worthy of writing up as a scholarly paper. We can’t begrudge him the time needed to pursue that, and we’re glad he found time for this project too.

Thanks to \[RandyKC\] for the tip.
