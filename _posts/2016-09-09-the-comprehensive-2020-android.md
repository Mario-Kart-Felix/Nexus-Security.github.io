**Why Should You Take This Course?**  
My name is Paulo Dichone, creator of the most best-selling online programming courses (with over 60,000 happy and satisfied students), and this time I have designed this Android Masterclass course – especially for YOU.  
  
I know how hard it can be to learn programming and Android development – there’s a lot of information out there but the problem is that none of it is complete, nor is it updated.  I understand how frustrating it’s to try to learn something on your own and spend months without seeing progress!  
  
That’s why I do what I do – teach.   
  
My sole goal is to show you that you can get started right away with Android development and start building your app ideas!  
  
Don’t just take our word for it, see what my past students had to say about the course:  
  
“I liked the course and the professor, I’m taking another course with him because he’s very good in my opinion, starts from beginner to advanced, very organized classes. A lot of examples in the course, and he was updating the course often too. Money well spent.” – Kevin ★★★★ (4.5 stars rating)  
  
“Great course. very easy in understanding and friendly learning. Good Job Sir. Thanks for this.” – Muhammad – ★★★★ (5 stars rating)  
  
“Well, in my opinion this is a great course since i knew nothing about java and by now im able to write my own apps pretty easily.” – Michael – ★★★★ (5 stars rating)  
  
“Great course! I learned lots from the numerous examples. I now have the confidence to build my own apps and to explore different areas of Android programming. – ★★★★ (4.5 stars rating)  
  
Great Course!!!! Thanks Paulo!!!!!” – Ian – ★★★★ (5 stars rating)  
  
“I am very satisfied with this course. I have only attended the Android part because I had a basic knowledge on Java. I really like how Paulo teaches. He goes step by step and you can understand everything. My first language is not english, but he speaks very clearly, I can understand every word. Also, he is a happy guy, and you can hear that through the courses that he really loves what he is doing.” – Antal – ★★★★ (5 stars rating)  
  
“Very well thought-out course. Flows smoothly with great delivery. I have been developing Android Apps for several years and I still found this course to be informative, relevant, and helpful. I would recommend everyone take this course if you are new to Android or returning for a refresher course.” – Douglas – ★★★★ (5 stars rating)
