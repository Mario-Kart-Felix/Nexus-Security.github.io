According to a recent inquiry conducted by the Wall Street Journal last week, the Cowlitz County PUD is amid more than 12 businesses that fell prey to a fresh cyber attack in the United States. Alice Dietz, spokesperson, Cowlitz County PUD, on Wednesday, authenticated that the company's firewall prevented the only corrupt e-mail that attackers transmitted. "We have pride in our Cybersecurity staff. We remain to achieve effective cyber safety standards. This is a classic instance of how serious Cowlitz County PUD is for its security," said Dietz in a statement.

No customer complaints regarding the attacks have appeared yet. The attackers that are still unidentified tried to download viruses on business networks across America using fraud e-mails. When the receivers open these phishing emails, the malware gets entry into the user's computer. The virus that was sent to businesses is called "Lookback." This malware lets attackers seize charge of targetâ€™s networks and take data. Very rare users at each business were attacked. The hackers checked the utility firms before launching the attack.  
  
"We are unaware of the employee that was targeted nor do we know the contents of the emails," says Dietz. "Experts recognized a couple of times in July and August when attackers had sent phishing e-mails," reports the Washington Journal. Dietz further continues that their company only got a mail in August. The malicious email was blocked by the company's firewall protection. "Our staff was not aware of the "Lookback," it only surfaced when the FBI looked into the issue. However, the FBI research didn't find any malicious emails in the company's data system," Cowlitz County PUD GM Gary Huhta told the Washington Journal.  
  
"The hackers forgot classifying data on victims shortly revealed on in a Hong Kong server," cyber-security experts described to the Washington Journal. "The company's safety mode itself obstructs e-mails from abroad," Dietz reported to The Daily News Businesses across the United States were attacked. "Another Washington business that was attacked was Klickitat County PUD, says the Washington Journal." The cyberattack was initially discovered by experts at Proofpoint, a Silicon Valley cyber safety firm.
