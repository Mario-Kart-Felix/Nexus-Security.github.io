The Dark Pursuer 1.69 MOD (Unlocked) APK For Android

You find yourself locked up alone in an abandoned place, but something is nearby, something unknown and dangerous. Try to find ways to get out of there before you can no longer ...

You can also play multiplayer with your friend! In this mode, you are the player and your friend is the monster who will try to catch you. Hide and run to win. Multiplayer is now global, you just create a name for the game, and your friend connects to the game by the name of the game from anywhere. Note that to play in multiplayer, one of the players must buy the complete game (purchase inside the application).
