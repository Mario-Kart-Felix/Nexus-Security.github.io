The database of 8.7 million former and current Beeline mobile customers was in the public domain. The test showed that the data is relevant. This database contains data of customers who connected Beeline home Internet. According to the press service of the mobile operator reported that the data leak was recorded in 2017, and the perpetrators were identified. Beeline assured that now most of the information is outdated data.  
  
According to experts, the information in the database is enough for attacks using social engineering methods, and there are still no ways to deal with fraudsters of this kind.  
  
According to the Beeline press service, the company immediately established an operational headquarters to investigate the situation.  
  
"Part of the information in the distributed archive does contain the data of the subscriber base of customers, however, a significant part of the information is outdated and irrelevant," the company said.  
  
They also noted that Beelineâ€™s customer base at the end of the second quarter of 2019 was 2.5 million subscribers, and not eight million, as attackers say.  
  
The company assured that they are making every effort to ensure that this does not happen again.  
  
"We appealed to all file-sharing resources where information about customers was posted. Many of them immediately agreed to remove it," Beeline said.  
  
It is noted that the criminals are trying to re-publish the data, which indicates their desire to discredit the company.  
  
"Our security service is investigating this incident, we will be grateful for any information that will help this work, both from our customers and from colleagues in the market," the press service said.  
  
It also reported that the company is working closely with the competent authorities and agencies to prevent the disclosure of personal data not only of its customers, but also customers of all Telecom operators.  
  
The company assures that outsiders do not have the opportunity to carry out transactions with the accounts and tariffs of their customers.
