Dr. Héloïse Stevance [posts on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Sydonahi/status/1225879131767767040?s=03) the differences between a star supernova and the smaller kilonova:

> SUPERNOVA: the explosion of a massive star dying or of a white Dwarf getting too big. They produce the star stuff we are made of like calcium!
> 
> KILONOVA: The explosion resulting from the merger of two Neutron Stars! These create rarer elements we find in our jewellery and smartphones like Gold, Palladium, Platinum, Silver and rare earth elements!
