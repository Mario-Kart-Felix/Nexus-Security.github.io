America may be divided into 50 states, but many areas are culturally similar. 

In his fourth book, "[American Nations: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures in North America](https://www.amazon.com/American-Nations-History-Regional-Cultures/dp/0143122029)," award-winning author [Colin Woodard](http://www.colinwoodard.com/) identifies 11 distinct cultures that have historically divided the US.

"The country has been arguing about a lot of fundamental things lately including state roles and individual liberty," Woodard, a Maine native who won the [2012 George Polk Award](https://www.pressherald.com/special/Read_the_Polk_Award-winning_story_and_more_of_Woodards_work.html) for investigative reporting, told Business Insider. "\[But\] in order to have any productive conversation on these issues," he added, "you need to know where you come from."

Woodard also believes the nation is likely to become more polarized, even though America is becoming a more diverse place every day. He says this is because people are "self-sorting."

"People choose to move to places where they identify with the values,"  Woodard says. "Red minorities go south and blue minorities go north to be in the majority. This is why blue states are getting bluer and red states are getting redder and the middle is getting smaller."

Here's how Woodard describes each nation:
