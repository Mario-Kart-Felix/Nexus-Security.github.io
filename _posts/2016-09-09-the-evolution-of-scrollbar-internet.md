An interesting interactive evolutionary history of the graphical user interface scrollbar via [matoseb.org](https://scrollbars.matoseb.com/).

Listed by year, you can see how scrollbars have evolved.

The project is part of 30 years of internet history collected by [Information Mesh](http://infomesh.org/)

> Information Mesh is a web platform celebrating the 30th anniversary of the World Wide Web that explores social, technical, cultural and legal facts throughout different interactive timelines. The project was realized by Media & Interaction Design students at [ECAL/University of Art and Design, Lausanne](https://ecal.ch/fr/100/homepage). It was initiated in October 2018 during a one week workshop in partnership with swissnex San Francisco, where students visited key partners and began developing the project.
> 
> The timelines present an overview of Web history, starting with the proposal for hypertext by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989, initially under the name “Information Mesh.” From this start date, users can then explore 30 years of evolution.
