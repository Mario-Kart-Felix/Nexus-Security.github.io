> The Federal Aviation Administration wants to implement new rules that would enable the remote identification and tracking of unmanned aerial vehicles or drones. Under its proposal — available for viewing on Federal Register’s website — UAVs will be required to broadcast their location and identification info directly from the unmanned aircraft and to transmit the same information to the FAA’s location tracking system via internet connection.
> 
> UAVs only flying within 400 feet of their operators don’t have to broadcast that information but will still have to transmit it to the system via the internet. To note, operators can choose between their drone’s serial number or a randomly generated alphanumeric code to use as their machines’ ID, if they want to protect their privacy. All UAVs that require FAA registration — recreational drones under 0.55 pounds aren’t included — will have to comply with the new regulations within the next three years after they go into effect.
