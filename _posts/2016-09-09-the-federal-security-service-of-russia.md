Mobile applications with an electronic passport will not be able to completely replace a physical document. The FSB opposed the idea of placing the full document in smartphones.  
  
The FSB considers it extremely unreliable to place the passport data of Russians in applications based on foreign operating systems iOS and Android, as they will not be able to guarantee the security of data and absolute access control from unauthorized persons. It will be possible to fully use the application as an identity card only when the domestic operating systems will function normally in Russia.  
  
"There is a risk that Apple or Google developers will be able to access the data stored in the application", suggests Alexander Kruglov, senior analyst at Digital Security.  
  
"Theoretically, there is such a possibility, since iOS or Android developers can insert a traffic analyzer into the next update of the system and collect user data", added he.  
  
According to Kruglov, Apple, for example, refuses FBI requests to open access to iPhones of suspects.  
  
It is worth noting that there is a Russian operating system Aurora created on the basis of the Finnish Sailfish. The state was going to supply officials and civil servants with phones with Aurora OS, they were going to spend 160 billion rubles (2,4 million $) on this. But there are practically no devices with preinstalled Aurora OS and applications for this operating system.  
  
During a recent meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Maxim Akimov, it was decided that a smartphone app will appear and will be able to verify the identity of a citizen in most, but not all situations.  
  
Most likely, citizens will be able to use the app only for simple services: for example, to verify the age when buying alcohol or cigarettes. But it will be possible to buy an apartment only through a card with a chip.  
  
Earlier, E Hacking News [reported](https://www.ehackingnews.com/2019/07/all-data-is-in-plastic-usual-passports.html) that the Russian government has determined the basic parameters of the future e-passport. It will have two components - a plastic card with a chip and a mobile application. Documents of the new type will be issued to Russians from 2020 in Moscow. Paper passports will no longer be issued, but old documents will remain valid until their expiration date. The e-passport will become a universal carrier of information about a person, necessary for his identification.
