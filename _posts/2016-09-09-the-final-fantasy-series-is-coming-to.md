Among the 50-plus new games that Microsoft is bringing to its Xbox Game Pass subscription service over the next year are ten _Final Fantasy_ games. The list encompasses every single-player mainline game released in the series since 1997's _Final Fantasy VII_, including select spinoff games like _Final Fantasy X-2_, and _Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII_. Microsoft included the games in a list of titles that will start appearing "this holiday," and said that they'll be added over the course of 2020.

There have been a bunch of different remasters of these games over the years, and in most cases it seems like Xbox Games Pass subscribers are getting the most recent version of each title. There are the HD remasters of _X_ and _X-2_, and you're also getting the _Zodiac Age_ version of _Final Fantasy XII_. Here's the complete list of _Final Fantasy_ games coming to the service:

*   _Final Fantasy VII_
*   _Final Fantasy VIII: Remastered_
*   _Final Fantasy IX_
*   _Final Fantasy X: HD Remastered_
*   _Final Fantasy X-2: HD Remastered_
*   _Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age_
*   _Final Fantasy XIII_
*   _Final Fantasy XIII-2_
*   _Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII_
*   _Final Fantasy XV_

The big two games missing from this list are _Final Fantasy_'s two MMOs, _Final Fantasy XI_ and _XIV_. However, speaking to members of the press at X019 earlier today, Microsoft's gaming chief, Phil Spencer, said that the company plans to bring _Final Fantasy 14_ to the service at a later date. "I wanted you to know, rest assured that we will be bringing that game to Xbox," said Spencer. "We have a great relationship with Yoshida-san and we're working through what it means to bring \[to Xbox\] a cross-platform MMO that they've run for years."

Other new games coming to Xbox Game Pass over the next year include _Darksiders III_, _Tekken 7_, _The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt_, and multiple _Yakuza_ titles _including Yakuza 0, Kiwami,_ and _Kiwami 2._ If you want to try out the service for yourself, then Microsoft is offering a three month subscription for a promotional price of $1. For a limited time, the company is offering one month of EA Access, three months of Discord Nitro, and six months of Spotify Premium for new and existing Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.
