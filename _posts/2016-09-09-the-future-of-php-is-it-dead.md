PHP is Still Dominating the Web
===============================

If you take a simple look at the numbers PHP is definitely not dead. PHP is the most used server-side programming language by far. Approximately 75 percent of all webpages are powered by PHP. Take a look at the graph below and see how far PHP is ahead of its competition in terms of how often it’s used. It is fair to conclude that PHP isn’t dead based on this statistic since 75 percent is far too high number for a dead language!

One of the reasons that PHP is used by so many websites is because WordPress uses PHP. The market share of WordPress is approximately 34 percent of all websites. That’s 75 million websites using WordPress.

Furthermore, there are some other CMS’s like Drupal (3%) and Joomla(2%) which also have a significant share of the market. And there are some popular shop management systems, like Magento, which have around 1 percent of the total market share.

A lot of big content and shop management systems are using PHP, which makes PHP important and relevant.
