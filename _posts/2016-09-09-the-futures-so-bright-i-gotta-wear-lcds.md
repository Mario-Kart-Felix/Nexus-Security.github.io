Whether it was rays from the Sun that made a 150 million kilometer trip just to ruin your day or somebody’s unreasonably bright aftermarket headlights, at some point or another we’ve all experienced the discomfort of bright spots in our eyes. But short of wearing welder’s goggles all the time, what can we do? Luckily for us, [\[Nick Bild\] has come up with a solution](https://github.com/nickbild/light_brakes). Sort of.

Modifying the LCD so it can be seen through.

By adding LCDs to a pair of standard sunglasses, \[Nick\] has created something he’s calling “Light Brakes”. The idea is that the LCDs, having their backings removed, can essentially be used as programmable shutters to block out a specific part of the image that’s passing through them. With the addition of a Raspberry Pi and a camera, the Light Brakes can identify an unusually bright source of light and block it from the wearer’s vision by drawing a sufficiently large blob on the LCDs.

At least, that’s the idea. As you can see in the video after the break, the LCDs ability to block out a moving source of light is somewhat debatable. It’s also unclear what, if any, effect the “blocking” would have on UV, so you definitely shouldn’t try looking at the sun with a pair of these.

That said, a refined version of the concept could have some very interesting applications. For instance, imagine a pair of glasses that could actively block out advertisements or other unpleasant images from your field of vision. If this all sounds a bit like something out of an episode of _Black Mirror_, that’s because it is.

Attentive readers may have noticed that this isn’t the first time these fashionable frames have graced the pages of Hackaday. Over the summer they were used in a very interesting [field of view home automation project that \[Nick\] was working on](https://hackaday.com/2019/08/15/home-automation-at-a-glance-using-ai-glasses/). This also [isn’t the first time he’s stuck a pair of small LCDs](https://hackaday.com/2019/06/23/vr-on-the-6502/) in front of his eyes in the name of progress. We’re starting to identify something of a trend here, though we certainly aren’t complaining.
