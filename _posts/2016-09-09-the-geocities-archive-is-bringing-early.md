> Geocities was one of the first places your average person could make a website for free. [The Geocities Gallery](https://geocities.restorativland.org/) aims to archive these sites and return them to functionality, MIDIs and all.
> 
> Geocities was a web hosting service launched in 1994. Along with Angelfire and Tripod, Geocities offered your average human being the ability to build their own website. What made the service unique was its neighborhoods. During sign up, users would select which neighborhood would host their site according to what their site would be about. Websites about theater would be hosted on Broadway, and sites about sports would make their home in the Colosseum. According to [a Wired retrospective on the service during its closure in 2009](https://www.wired.com/2009/11/geocities/), Geocities hosted over 38 million websites before it closed.
