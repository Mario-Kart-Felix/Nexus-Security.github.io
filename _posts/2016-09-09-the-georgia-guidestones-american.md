The **Georgia Guidestones** are a [granite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granite "Granite") monument erected in 1980 in [Elbert County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbert_County,_Georgia "Elbert County, Georgia"), [Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state) "Georgia (U.S. state)"), in the United States. A set of 10 guidelines is inscribed on the structure in eight modern languages and a shorter message is inscribed at the top of the structure in four ancient language scripts.

The monument stands at an approximate elevation of 750 feet (230 m) above [sea level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level "Sea level"), about 90 miles (140 km) east of [Atlanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia "Atlanta, Georgia"), 45 miles (72 km) from [Athens, Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens,_Georgia "Athens, Georgia") and 9 miles (14 km) north of the center of the city of [Elberton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elberton,_Georgia "Elberton, Georgia").

One slab stands in the center, with four arranged around it. A [capstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(architecture) "Coping (architecture)") lies on top of the five slabs, which are astronomically aligned. An additional stone tablet, which is set in the ground a short distance to the west of the structure, provides some notes on the history and purpose of the guidestones. The structure is sometimes referred to as an "American [Stonehenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge "Stonehenge")".[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-1) The monument is 19 feet 3 inches (5.87 m) tall, made from six granite slabs weighing 237,746 pounds (107,840 kg) in all.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-Sullivan_2009-2) The anonymity of the guidestones' authors and their apparent advocacy of [population control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_population_planning "Human population planning"), [eugenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics "Eugenics") and [internationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalism_(politics) "Internationalism (politics)") have made them a target for controversy and [conspiracy theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory "Conspiracy theory").

History
-------

In June 1979, a man using the [pseudonym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym "Pseudonym") Robert C. Christian approached the Elberton Granite Finishing Company on behalf of "a small group of loyal Americans", and commissioned the structure. Christian explained that the stones would function as a compass, calendar and clock, and should be capable of withstanding catastrophic events. Joe Fendley of Elberton Granite assumed that Christian was "a nut" and attempted to discourage him by giving a quote several times higher than any project the company had taken, explaining that the guidestones would require additional tools and consultants. Christian accepted the quote.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-Sullivan_2009-2) When arranging payment, Christian explained that he represented a group which had been planning the guidestones for 20 years, and which intended to remain anonymous.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-Sullivan_2009-2)

Christian delivered a scale model of the guidestones and ten pages of specifications.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-Sullivan_2009-2) The five-acre[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-Sullivan_2009-2) (2 ha) land was apparently purchased by Christian on October 1, 1979,[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-3)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-4)\[_[non-primary source needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary,_secondary_and_tertiary_sources "Wikipedia:No original research")_\] from farm owner Wayne Mullinex.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-Sullivan_2009-2) Mullinex and his children were given lifetime cattle grazing rights on the guidestones site.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-Sullivan_2009-2) The monument was unveiled on March 22, 1980, before an audience variously described as 100[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-Moran-2004-5) or 400 people.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-Sullivan_2009-2) Christian later transferred ownership of the land and the guidestones to Elbert County.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-Sullivan_2009-2)

The stones defaced with polyurethane paint and graffiti

In 2008, the stones were defaced with [polyurethane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyurethane "Polyurethane") paint and graffiti with slogans such as "Death to the new world order".[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-6)_[Wired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine) "Wired (magazine)")_ magazine called the defacement "the first serious act of vandalism in the guidestones' history".[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-Sullivan_2009-2) In September 2014, an employee of the Elbert County maintenance department contacted the [Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation "Federal Bureau of Investigation") when the stones were vandalized with graffiti including the phrase "I Am [Isis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isis "Isis"), goddess of love".[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-7)

Description
-----------

### Inscriptions

A message consisting of a set of ten guidelines or principles is engraved on the Georgia Guidestones[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-Smithsonian-8) in eight different languages, one language on each face of the four large upright stones. Moving clockwise around the structure from due north, these languages are: [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language"), [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language "Spanish language"), [Swahili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_language "Swahili language"), [Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_language "Hindi language"), [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language"), [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"), [Traditional Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language "Chinese language"), and [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language").

1.  Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.
2.  Guide reproduction wisely — improving fitness and diversity.
3.  Unite humanity with a living new language.
4.  Rule passion — faith — tradition — and all things with tempered reason.
5.  Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.
6.  Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court.
7.  Avoid petty laws and useless officials.
8.  Balance personal rights with social duties.
9.  Prize truth — beauty — love — seeking harmony with the infinite.
10.  Be not a cancer on the earth — Leave room for nature — Leave room for nature.

Explanatory tablet
------------------

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Georgia_Guidestones_10.jpg/220px-Georgia_Guidestones_10.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Georgia_Guidestones_10.jpg)

An explanatory tablet is set alongside the stones

A few feet to the west of the monument, an additional granite ledger has been set level with the ground. This tablet identifies the structure and the languages used on it, lists various facts about the size, weight, and astronomical features of the stones, the date it was installed, and the sponsors of the project. It also speaks of a [time capsule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_capsule "Time capsule") buried under the tablet, but spaces on the stone reserved for filling in the dates on which the capsule was buried and is to be opened have not been inscribed, so it is uncertain if the time capsule was put in place.

The complete text of the explanatory tablet is detailed below. The tablet is somewhat inconsistent with respect to punctuation, misspells the word "pseudonym". The original spelling, punctuation, and line breaks in the text have been preserved in the transcription which follows (letter case is not). At the top center of the tablet is written:

> The Georgia Guidestones  
> 
> Center cluster erected March 22, 1980

Immediately below this is the outline of a square, inside which is written:

> Let these be guidestones to an Age of Reason

Around the edges of the square are written translations to four ancient languages, one per edge. Starting from the top and proceeding clockwise, they are: [Babylonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_language "Akkadian language") (in [cuneiform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform "Cuneiform") script), [Classical Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Greek "Classical Greek"), [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit") and [Ancient Egyptian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_language "Egyptian language") (in [hieroglyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_hieroglyphs "Egyptian hieroglyphs")).

Undated instructions for the site's time capsule

On the left side of the tablet is the following column of text:

> **Astronomic Features**  
> 
> 1\. Channel through stone  
> indicates celestial pole  
> 2\. Horizontal slot indicates  
> annual travel of sun  
> 3\. Sunbeam through capstone  
> marks noontime throughout  
> the year
> 
> **Author:** R.C. Christian  
> (a pseudonyn) \[_[sic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic "Sic")_\]
> 
> **Sponsors:** A small group  
> of Americans who seek  
> the Age of Reason
> 
> **Time Capsule**  
> Placed six feet below this spot  
> On  
> To be opened on

The words appear as shown under the time capsule heading; no dates are engraved.

### Guidestone languages

Below the two columns of text is written the caption "GUIDESTONE LANGUAGES", with a diagram of the granite slab layout beneath it. The names of eight [modern languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_languages "Modern languages") are inscribed along the long edges of the projecting rectangles, one per edge. Starting from due north and moving clockwise around so that the upper edge of the northeast rectangle is listed first, they are [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language "English language"), [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language "Spanish language"), [Swahili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swahili_language "Swahili language"), [Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi "Hindi"), [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language"), [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"), [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language "Chinese language"), and [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language"). At the bottom center of the tablet is the following text:

> Additional information available at Elberton Granite Museum & Exhibit  
> 
> College Avenue  
> Elberton, Georgia

### Astronomical features

The four outer stones are oriented to mark the limits of the 18.6 year [lunar declination cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_standstill "Lunar standstill").[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-GeorgiaMountains-9) The center column features a hole drilled at an angle from one side to the other, through which can be seen the [North Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Star "North Star"), a star whose position changes only very gradually over time. The same pillar has a slot carved through it which is aligned with the Sun's [solstices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstices "Solstices") and [equinoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinoxes "Equinoxes"). A ​7⁄8in (22 mm) aperture in the [capstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping_(architecture) "Coping (architecture)") allows a ray of sun to pass through at noon each day, shining a beam on the center stone indicating the day of the year.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-Sullivan_2009-2)

Interpretations
---------------

[Yoko Ono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoko_Ono "Yoko Ono") praised the inscribed messages as "a stirring call to rational thinking", while _[Wired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine) "Wired (magazine)")_ stated that unspecified opponents have labeled them as the "Ten Commandments of the [Antichrist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antichrist "Antichrist")".[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-Sullivan_2009-2)

The guidestones have become a subject of interest for [conspiracy theorists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theorists "Conspiracy theorists"). One of them, an activist named [Mark Dice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Dice "Mark Dice"), demanded that the guidestones "be smashed into a million pieces, and then the rubble used for a construction project",[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-Jones_Elberton-10) claiming that the guidestones are of "a deep [Satanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanism "Satanism") origin", and that R. C. Christian belongs to "a [Luciferian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferianism "Luciferianism") secret society" related to the "[New World Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_Order_(conspiracy_theory) "New World Order (conspiracy theory)")".[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-Sullivan_2009-2) At the unveiling of the monument, a local minister proclaimed that he believed the monument was "for sun worshipers, for cult worship and for devil worship".[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-Moran-2004-5) Others have suggested that the stones were commissioned by the [Rosicrucians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosicrucian "Rosicrucian"),[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-11) with conspiracy theorist [Jay Weidner](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jay_Weidner&action=edit&redlink=1 "Jay Weidner (page does not exist)") observing that the pseudonym of the man who commissioned the stones – "R. C. Christian" – resembles [Rose Cross Christian, or Christian Rosenkreuz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Rosenkreuz "Christian Rosenkreuz"), the founder of the [Rosicrucian Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosicrucian_Order "Rosicrucian Order").[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-Sullivan_2009-2)[Alex Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Jones_(radio_host) "Alex Jones (radio host)")'s film _Endgame: Blueprint for Global Enslavement_ proposes that the guidestones are a harbinger of self-appointed elites who intend on exterminating most of the world's population.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-12)

The most widely agreed-upon interpretation of the stones is that they describe the basic concepts required to rebuild a devastated civilization.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-Sullivan_2009-2) Author [Brad Meltzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Meltzer "Brad Meltzer") notes that the stones were built in 1979 at the height of the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War"), and thus argues that they may have been intended as a message to the possible survivors of a [nuclear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_war "Nuclear war") [World War III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_III "World War III"). The engraved suggestion to keep humanity's population below 500 million could have been made under the assumption that war had already reduced humanity below this number.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-13)

The guidestones were briefly shown and discussed in the 1986 documentary film _[Sherman's March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman%27s_March_(1986_film) "Sherman's March (1986 film)")_, and were featured extensively in a 2012 episode of _[Mysteries at the Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysteries_at_the_Museum "Mysteries at the Museum")_, a "Monumental Mysteries Special" featuring [Don Wildman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Wildman "Don Wildman").[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones#cite_note-14)
