GPTrue-or-Fale calculating the probability that this sample text was written by a human. (Text from Robin Sloan’s MageFrame project).

OpenAI released the GPT-2 algorithm in February of 2019. At the time, only a small parameter model was released [due to concerns about the abuse of the model](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/).

> Due to our concerns about malicious applications of the technology, we are not releasing the trained model…we are instead releasing a much [smaller model](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2) for researchers to experiment with, as well as a [technical paper](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf).

Over the year, OpenAI has worked with academia and industry to investigate the potential for abuse of the model. Ultimately, they decided to [release](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-2-6-month-follow-up/) larger and larger versions of GPT-2. The main takehomes of their research indicate that:

> 1\. Coordination is difficult, but possible.  
> 2\. Humans can be convinced by synthetic text.  
> 3\. Detection isn’t simple.

That last piece, “detection” precipitated the creation of a browser extension to do just that! @karpathy [requested](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1192169928079503360) the extension at the beginning of November, @madavidj [offered a job](https://twitter.com/madavidj/status/1192189367579639810?s=20) to anyone that managed it and [several](https://twitter.com/ChiMaBa1/status/1196567494426873857) [people](https://twitter.com/thesofakillers/status/1196410719006285826) delivered. The extension ‘[GPTrue-or-False](https://github.com/thesofakillers/GPTrue-or-False)‘ was created by Giulio Starace (@thesofakillers) for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gptrue-or-false/bikcfchmnacmfhneafnpfekgfhckplfj) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gptrue-or-false/). The extension “displays the likelihood that selected portions of text were generated by GPT-2”. Take a look at the example above run on a sample of AI-generated text from [Robin Sloan’s MageFrame project](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/10/31/writing-with-the-mageframe-gpt2-machinelearning-artificialintelligence-fantasy-fiction-robinsloan/).
