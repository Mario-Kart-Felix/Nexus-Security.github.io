You can now play the Half-Life games for free on Steam. However, the offer stands for a limited time only. Essentially, Valve is offering the previous games in the series for free before the release of the next game in the series, titled Half-Life: Alyx.

Preparing for the Release of Half-Life: Alyx
--------------------------------------------

Half-Life: Alyx, a virtual reality first-person shooter, is due to be released in March 2020. The game is set between the original Half-Life and Half-Life 2, as players take control of Alyx Vance as she fights Combine using gravity gloves similar to the gravity gun.

So, to prepare gamers for the subsequent release of Half-Life: Alyx, Valve is giving away the previous games in the series. Which means Half-Life, Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode 1 and 2, and Opposing Force and Blue Shift are all available to play for free.

In [a surprise announcement on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/news/57848/), Valve says that “the Half-Life: Alyx team believes that the best way to enjoy the new game is to play through the old ones, especially Half-Life 2 and the episodes, so we want to make that as easy as possible.”

You can play the free Half-Life games for free by following the links on [Valve’s list of Half-Life games](https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/valve/list/7). The eligible games have a “Play for free! Ends in 2 months” banner under them, along with “Play now” links. You will, however, need to have Steam installed.

The Perfect Time to Play the Half-Life Games
--------------------------------------------

There’s a good chance you already own the Half-Life games. Because not only have they been around for a long time, Valve has also discounted them massively in the past. Still, if you have never played the Half-Life games, this is the perfect opportunity to do so.
