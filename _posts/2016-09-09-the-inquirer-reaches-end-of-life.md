The INQUIRER reaches end-of-life

**IT IS WITH A HEAVY HEART** we must announce that _The INQUIRER_ has reached end-of-life. 

Our publisher, Incisive Media, has made the decision to shut down the website, which has come as a huge shock to everyone here at _The INQUIRER_. We were informed by our publisher last week - _Merry Christmas! Happy Tory landslide!_ - which has made the decision that due to a recent decline in digital advertising, along with a change of focus for the business, it was time for _The INQUIRER_ to go dark. 

The site will remain live until the end of March, but Thursday will be the final day that we will be publishing new content.

Myself and the entire _INQ_ team have done everything in our power to try and prevent a closure, but unfortunately - despite our best efforts - we haven't been successful, so far at least. But one thing we can make sure of is that we don't bow out quietly. 

I've been at _The INQUIRER_ for almost eight years, moving up to editor for the past three, and it has been an absolute privilege. Before joining, I was a long-time admirer of the site, which since its debut in 2001 has energised tech journalism with its fearless attitude, snarky reporting, [world-reaching exclusives](https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2450852/updategate-microsoft-is-reportedly-upgrading-pcs-to-windows-10-automatically " Updategate: Microsoft clarifies its 'automatic' updates to Windows 10 Pro") and [its ability to have an, er,  bit fun now and again](https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3083272/samsung-app-apparition-makes-spooktacle-of-some-knobs-dinkle "Samsung app-apparition makes spooktacle of some knob's dinkle").

This is all, of course, because of the fantastic team of journalists behind it. I've had the pleasure of working with many; there's Madeline Bennett, who taught me everything I know about this relentless industry, and Dave Neal, our much-loved 'crisps and dinkles' correspondent [who sadly lost his battle with cancer in 2018](https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3023923/dave-neal-obituary "Dave Neal"). 

And then there's_ INQ'_s current dream team; Chris Merriman, Roland Moore-Colyer and Alan Martin - three of the most hardworking, talented, and hilarious people I've ever met, who together made _The INQUIRER_ a very special place to work. So special, in fact, that we hope this isn't the last you'll be seeing of us. Watch this space, dear reader.

And that brings me to the most important point of all. Thank-you - _yes, you!_ - dear reader. Over the past two decades, you have been the lifeblood of this website. Without you, _The INQUIRER_ would have been a short-lived experiment, but your inquisitiveness, support and, er, often _honest_ feedback made _The INQUIRER_ the success that it was.

We'll see you down the pub, ours is a large one. µ
