**The IPKat team** \[including Merpel, of course\] send their hearty congratulations to two newly-minted QCs with appropriately silky IP skills:  
  

*   **[Andrew Norris](https://www.hogarthchambers.com/barristers/andrew-norris)** (Hogarth Chambers), a trade marks specialist who was involved in (among others) the **_[Jack Wills v House of Fraser](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2014/02/subtle-but-insidious-transfer-from.html)_** and **[_Fenty v Topshop_](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2015/01/court-of-appeal-confirms-that-sale-of-t.html)** cases; and
*   **[James Segan](https://www.blackstonechambers.com/barristers/james-segan/)** (Blackstone Chambers), whose admirably broad practice takes in (among other things) IP and media matters, including the recent _Conversant v Huawei and ZTE_ Supreme Court appeal. 

  

The recent appointees will no doubt be able to confirm or refute the accuracy of this [artist's impression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euX8i2HmSas) of the notoriously challenging QC appointment process.
