As is tradition for us, we end the day with a dedication to all the incredible women who make Adafruit what it is. A huge Thank You to all the women of Adafruit who work, lead, and inspire! Keep being excellent!

We hope everyone continues to celebrate female role models near and far. Happy Ada Lovelace Day!!
