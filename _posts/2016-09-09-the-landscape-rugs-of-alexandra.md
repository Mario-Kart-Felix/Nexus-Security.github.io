> Love these rugs by artist [Alexandra Kehayoglou](https://www.instagram.com/alexandrakehayoglou/) from Buenos Aires. A combination of sculpture and installation, art and craft, Kehayoglou’s pieces are both functional and environmentally conscious. Each one is based on a place she has visited and wishes to preserve or draw our attention to. This includes areas that have been depleted through mining and industrial use or are disappearing completely, as in the case of the glacial rivers in South America. In this way, Kehayoglou’s work is uniquely tied to a call for greater environmental awareness and critique of a society which does not seem sufficiently alarmed by issues of climate change and our devastating impact on the planet.
