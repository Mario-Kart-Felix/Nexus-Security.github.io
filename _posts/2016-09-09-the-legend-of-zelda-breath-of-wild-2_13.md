So they aren’t porting the sequel to the Breath of the Wild to the N64. A twitter user shared this video showing what that trailer _might_ look like. If you are a Zelda fan, particularly OoT era, this trailer will make you smile.

> Modeler and animator [The Regressor](https://twitter.com/the_regressor) took Nintendo’s Breath of the Wild sequel trailer it showcased during E3 in June and “demade” it – that is, recreated it using N64-style graphics, with era-perfect audio from [Vince94](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBNpl77rw30jHmBsOFsl7iA).

> The Regressor, who created all the 3D assets from scratch using Maya 2009 and Photoshop, explained: “The quality is supposed to be ‘bad’: if it looks like a flaw or error, it was likely 100 per cent intentional and either left in or put in on purpose. My goal was not to replicate Ocarina or Majora’s Mask visuals exactly or be 100 per cent technically accurate to N64/DD capabilities or specifications; only ‘similar’ with artistic liberties.”
