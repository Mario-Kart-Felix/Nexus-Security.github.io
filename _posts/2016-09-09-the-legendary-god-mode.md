[](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/null)My first experience with invulnerability came in 1993 when I started playing _Doom_. _Doom_[](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/null) was a first‐person shooter game that was divided up into nine level episodes. You played a character nicknamed DoomGuy who was a space marine who finds himself in Hell. There was a particular IDBEHOLDV cheat that made you invulnerable. This was considered God mode.

[](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/null)In 2007, with the debut of Windows 7 came a tool that was nicknamed _God mode_[](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/null). Its real name is Windows Master Control Panel, although I personally think God mode sounds more epic.

[](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/null)Windows Master Control Panel gives you access to all the operating systems control panels within one folder. You can enable God mode in Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 as well. The feature is useful for those in IT, those who manage a computer, and advanced Windows experts. Enabling God mode creates a folder that gives you access to every single Windows OS setting. The icon you see in [Figure 2.8](https://proquest-safaribooksonline-com.eztncc.vccs.edu:2443/9781119552932/head_2_26_html#c02-fig-0008)[](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/null) is for the folder that gets created.

1.  Make sure you are using an account with administrative privileges.
2.  Right‐click your Windows 7, 8.1, or 10 desktop and choose New ➪ Folder.
3.  Name the folder **GodMode.{ED7BA470‐8E54‐465E‐825C‐99712043E01C}**.
4.  Press Enter and double‐click the Windows Master Control Panel icon to open the file.

[](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/null)It's not quite as exciting as being completely invulnerable in _Doom_[](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/null), but as far as being in IT, having all these tools in one spot is pretty awesome. Before you start experimenting with the wide assortment of tools, you may want to consider taking a backup of your machine. As shown in [Figure 2.9](https://proquest-safaribooksonline-com.eztncc.vccs.edu:2443/9781119552932/head_2_26_html#c02-fig-0009)[](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/null), when you open the `GodMode`[](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/null) folder, creating a backup and restore file will be one of the first options you see.
