Send messages of love with the love box from [Marcel Sör](https://frightanic.com/iot/the-lovebox-a-gift-from-a-maker/):

> The Lovebox is a project I learned about through a [Make: magazine](https://www.heise.de/select/make) article from 2019. A reader notified [ThingPulse](https://thingpulse.com) – of which I’m a co-founder – because the project’s Arduino sketch relies on an [open-source display driver](https://github.com/ThingPulse/esp8266-oled-ssd1306) provided by ThingPulse.

> When the Lovebox receives your message for a loved one, the heart wiggles until she/he lifts the lid and reads the message on the display hidden inside the box.
> 
> The initial app implementation polls a GitHub Gist for new content. If it sees a new message (text or image) it displays it and sets a servo in motion to which the heart is attached. When the lid is opened a photoresistor (acronymed LDR for Light Decreasing Resistance, or light-dependent resistor) registers the extra light in which case the app stops the servo.
