The Star Wars movies and TV series have spent decades building a world and developing concepts like the Force and alien species and [whatever Yoda i](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-mandalorian-reintroduced-a-major-alien-species/1100-6471372/)s, but there's one thing that's never been covered, until now: Where do people poop? And is there one receptacle that can accommodate all the different anatomies? The original [Disney+](https://www.cnet.com/news/disney-plus-streaming-service-launch-dares-prices-shows-movies-marvel-star-wars-pixar/) series [The Mandalorian](https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-mandalorian-34-photos-from-the-star-wars-disne/2900-2999/) finally has an answer to these burning questions.

In the first episode of the new series, the Mandalorian captures his bounty in the bar, the two are aboard his ship. His bounty is a Fledgling Mythrol--played by comedian Horatio Sanz--has to "evacuate" his thorax, so he heads down to the space toilet on the ship, called the Vacc Tube.

You can check it out below, and there is a whole lot going on in this fancy space toilet. However, this Vacc Tube is for a ship. How do toilets on planets differ?

And in the photo above is the space toilet in all its glory. There's actually a lot going on with this device. There looks to be a shower head that hangs down, a toilet-like device, and two tubes facing it. There are even two bars to hold on to while you "exorcise your demons."

As for where bodily fluids go after that, some ship captains just like to dump them on planets. After The Mandalorian captures the Fledgling Mythrol, their landspeeder driver--played by comedian Brian Posehn--says, "Be careful around the port. Everyone dumps their Gray Holds out. They think the whole entire planet is their own personal stink pit." Vacc Tubes and Gray Holds. We sure did learn a lot about pooping in space.

Well, there it is. The most important Star Wars news of the week. We can all go home now.

Hayner said, "With its first episode, The Mandalorian has made a statement about what a live-action Star Wars TV show looks like. Now, with the remaining seven episodes in Season 1, it needs to make a statement about how a Star Wars plot should unfold over a longer form of storytelling."
