There are many interesting forks of MicroPython and I’m going to get them in one place with as much information as possible. [This is the start of the list on GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-micropythons), please add any comments here with ones we’ve missed, or open an issue/PR to update the list. I’ll add some more formatting later, this is for info-gathering at the moment!

**List so far …**

*   MicroPython
*   MicroPython – micro:bit
*   MicroPython – openmv
*   MicroPython – PyCom
*   MicroPython – LEGO
*   MicroPython – Xbee
*   MicroPython – Casio
*   MicroPython – Numworks
*   Pycopy
*   MicroPython – Microsemi, RISC-V (RV32 and RV64) architecture
*   ArduPy – Seeed
*   ESP32 ones… loboris
*   CircuitPython
*   CircuitPython – TI (called TI-Python)
*   CircuitPython – Gamebuino

**Looking to add:**

*   Name, is it also called MicroPython?
*   Where it is located, is the source code available?
*   What chip(s)/platform(s) are supported?
*   Who are the authors/maintainers?
*   2-3 sentences of why the fork was made or link/overview.
