In Archerpoint we would like everyone using **NAV / Business Central** in the community to be **Stay Current**, which means stay on the latest and greatest version of the product.  
  
We are upgrading one of the customers to the latest and greatest version to Business Central 2019 Wave 2 from NAV 2009 with multiple companies.  
  
This article applies if you are Upgrading to #NAV2013, #NAV2013R2 & #NAV2015.  
  
Everything was working fine till we started data upgrade to NAV 2015 from NAV 2009. During Data Upgrade to NAV 2015 system generated error message.
