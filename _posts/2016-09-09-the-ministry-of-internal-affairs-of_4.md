The Ministry of Internal Affairs will have units to combat crimes committed using IT-technologies. Units will be formed without increasing the staff.  
  
This decision was made by Vladimir Kolokoltsev, the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, at a meeting of the Collegium of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, which was held as a video conference with all regions of the country. The meeting was attended by representatives of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Finance, Roskomnadzor, Rosfinmonitoring and a number of leading financial institutions.  
  
The purpose of the creation of such units is to increase the efficiency of the prevention and suppression of crimes in the IT-sphere, as well as improving the skills and training of the most trained employees in identifying, revealing and investigating crimes committed using information and telecommunication technologies.  
  
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, every seventh crime in Russia is committed in the field of IT-technologies. Law enforcement agencies in recent years have noted an increase in the number of crimes committed using the Internet, including fraud, drug distribution, theft of funds and other crimes.  
  
At the moment, Vladimir Kolokoltsev instructed the heads of operational headquarters to prepare documents that will determine the structure, powers and functions of the new units to combat cybercrime.  
  
Currently, the Office “K” of the Ministry of Internal Affairs is engaged in crimes in the field of information technology. In particular, the employees of this Department are engaged in the fight against illegal trafficking in electronic equipment and special technical equipment.
