For many people, a retrocomputer is a classic machine from the past lovingly brought back to working order. But for some, the idea of a retrocomputer is wider than that, encompassing modern hardware that delivers to feel like a device from the past.

[The Monotron](https://github.com/thejpster/monotron) from \[Jonathan Pallant\] is one such computer. It’s definitely a retrocomputer such as you might have found in the 1980s, but it’s running on a much more modern Tiva-C TI Launchpad dev board sporting an ARM Cortex M4.

The platform has been created entirely in Rust, and emulates what would have been a rather desirable machine in the early 1980s. With an 800×600 pixel 8-colour VGA display interface, 32k of RAM, and mono 8-bit audio, it already has a few simple demos and games running upon it. \[Jonathan Pallant\] has given more than one talk on its design and capabilities, we’ve placed one of them as a video below the break. There is even a PCB available which adds all the ports as well as a micro SD card slot for program storage.

We like the Monotron, and we look forward to seeing it develop. It’s an exciting time for retrocomputig with projects such as the [RC2014](https://hackaday.com/2016/09/08/review-the-rc2014-z80-computer/) Z80 machine and the [Gigatron](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/25/how-the-gigatron-ttl-microcomputer-works/) TTL RISC processor, but is there space for an emulated one such as this? We hope so.
