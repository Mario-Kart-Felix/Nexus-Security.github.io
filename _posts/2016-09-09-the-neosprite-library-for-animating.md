From the Adafruit Forums [we hear from cuppaCoffee](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=161070) promoting Aaron Averill’s NeoSprite library:

> Hi, I am writing to the forum to promote Aaron Averill’s NeoSprite library. It was very useful for me, a novice, to quickly produce animation for a homemade NeoPixel strip matrix. Please see: [https://youtu.be/KBtatQ6hKQU](https://youtu.be/KBtatQ6hKQU)

> NeoSprite code found at: [https://github.com/aaronaverill/CircuitPython\_NeoSprite](https://github.com/aaronaverill/CircuitPython_NeoSprite)
> 
> It is written for [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/). The examples come with button press code to switch between animations, as demoed in my movie. You can also switch button state to true to play a folder of animations end to end as if it were one long movie. For my 21 x 8 pixel matrix, powered by the [Adafruit Feather M4 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3857) ATSAMD51, I was able to make animations 180 frames long or more, 8 bit, but also could play a folder of animation as if it were a longer movie.
