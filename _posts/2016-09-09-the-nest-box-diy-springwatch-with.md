Raspberry Pi used to create the Nest Box for viewing adorable baby birds.

Via [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/the-nest-box-diy-springwatch/):

> Jay runs a small network of livestreaming nest box cameras, with three currently sited and another three in the pipeline; excitingly, the new ones will include a kestrel box and a barn owl box! During the spring, all the cameras stream live to The Nest Box’s Facebook page, which has steadily built a solid following of several thousand wildlife fans.
