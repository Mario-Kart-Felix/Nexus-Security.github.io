Yes, there are [apps and websites to help you find interesting content on Netflix](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/sites-apps-find-movies-tv-shows-netflix/). But what if you have niche interests or want to watch content from an ultra-specific genre?

Change the Netflix Playback Speed
---------------------------------

Netflix is one of the best ways to ditch cable television. For a lot less money than cable and zero ads, you receive access to an amazing amount of entertainment, including movies, TV shows, and documentaries.

Even if you have to pair Netflix with another streaming service or two to cut the cord entirely, the long-term benefits of the whole setup are plenty. (Of course, you need a reliable internet connection for this to work.)

Speaking of benefits, here’s an upcoming one you can look forward to: [changing the Netflix playback speed](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-change-netflix-playback-speed/)!
