[n°Garage](https://www.tindie.com/stores/ndgarage/) announces [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ndgarage/status/1214721396607049728) their [Hippo Board](https://www.tindie.com/products/ndgarage/hippo/). It has a hippo design lit by 12 LED RGB NeoPixels. The board is a FeatherWing – it accepts any [Adafruit Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/category/943) microcontroller to program the lights. This would make a great badge!

Now available on [Tindie here](https://www.tindie.com/products/ndgarage/hippo/).

Below is a picture with an [Adafruit Feather M4 microcontroller](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3857) plugged into the back – it may be programmed in [CircuitPython](https://www.circuitpython.org/) or Arduino.

With a WiFi or Bluetooth Feather, this could be radio controlled. Many possibilities!
