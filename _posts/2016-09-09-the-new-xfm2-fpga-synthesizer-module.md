The [XFM2 Synthesizer Module](https://www.futur3soundz.com/xfm2) is a 64-voice, 2-part, 6-operator FM Synthesizer with built-in effects processor, built on an FPGA chip. The build is based on two pre-assembled development boards: the Digilent CMOD A7-35T (FPGA, USB, SRAM) and the [Adafruit UDA1334A (I2S stereo DAC)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3678). This combination allows to get the module running in less than 10 components (about $99 total cost). [Via Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2020/02/22/introducing-the-xfm2-a-new-fm-synthesizer-board/):

> A user manual, installation guide, and the binaries that have to be loaded into the FPGA – using the provided instructions – are all made available. Unfortunately no HDL source is provided, but that shouldn’t take away from the fun of assembling an FM synthesizer board like this.

René  said that based on the feedback to the XFM project, he is now working on a visual user interface for the board. Once this is all working and depending on the feedback from XFM2 users, he may decide to start a crowdfunding campaign.
