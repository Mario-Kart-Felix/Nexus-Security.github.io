The [OSH Park blog](https://blog.oshpark.com/2019/12/06/the-open-book-feather-e-reader/) discusses [Joey Castillo](https://hackaday.io/joeycastillo)‘s awesome open hardware reading device.

> The Open Book is an open-hardware device for reading books in all the languages of the world. It includes a large screen and buttons for navigation, as well as audio options for accessibility and ports to extend its functionality. Its detailed silkscreen, with the all the manic energy and quixotic ambition of a Dr. Bronner’s bottle, aims to demystify the Open Book’s own design, breaking down for the curious reader both how the book works, and how they can build one for themselves.

You can read about the project here including the use of [OSH Park purple PCBs](https://oshpark.com/). You can see a demo of the project on the [Adafruit Show and Tell show below](https://youtu.be/phtM7B0MXtc?t=959) (it’s at 15 minutes, 59 seconds).
