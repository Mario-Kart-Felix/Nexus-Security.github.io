The timing could not have been better, [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/) now has over [100 boards](https://circuitpython.org/downloads) (more than half are **not** from Adafruit) and the 100th board was… [The Open Hardware Summit 2020 badge!](https://circuitpython.org/board/ohs2020_badge/)

What a great milestone for the open-source hardware, and CircuitPython communities, when something is open, it’s shared, improved, built upon, and most of all – people use it together.

[What is the Open Hardware Summit?](https://2020.oshwa.org/)

> The Open Hardware Summit is the annual conference organized by the [Open Source Hardware Association](https://www.oshwa.org/) a 501(c)(3) not for profit charity. It is the world’s first comprehensive conference on open hardware; a venue and community in which we discuss and draw attention to the rapidly growing Open Source Hardware movement.
