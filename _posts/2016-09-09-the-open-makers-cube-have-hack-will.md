Don’t bother denying it, we know your workbench is a mess. A tangled pile of wires, tools, and half-completed projects is standard decor for any hardware hacker. In fact, if you’ve got a spotless work area, we might even be a bit skeptical about your credentials in this field. But that’s not to say we wouldn’t be interested in some way of keeping the electronic detritus in check, perhaps something like the [Open Makers Cube created by \[technoez\]](https://github.com/technoez/open-makers-cube).

[![](https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/makerscube_detail2.jpg?w=290)](https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/makerscube_detail2.jpg)This all-in-one hardware hacking station uses DIN rails and 3D-printed mounting hardware to allow the user to attach a wide array of tools, gadgets, and boards to the outside surface where they’re easily accessible. The OpenSCAD design includes mounts for the usual suspects like the Raspberry Pi, Arduino Uno, and general purpose breadboards. Of course, your own custom mounts are just a few lines of code away.

The Cube also includes a lighted magnifying glass on a flexible arm so you can zoom in on what you’re working on, a simple “helping hands” attachment, and provisions for internal USB power. It even features angled feet so the front side of the cube is held at a more comfortable viewing angle. All of which is held together by a lightweight and portable frame built from square aluminum tubing.

We can understand if you’ve got some doubts about the idea of mounting all of your tools and projects to the side of a jaunty little cube. But even if the jury is still out on [the mobile workspace concept](https://hackaday.com/2016/09/17/portable-workbench-crams-an-entire-workspace-into-one-box/), one thing is for sure: the Open Makers Cube is easily one of the best documented projects we’ve seen in recent memory. Thanks to NopSCADlib, \[technoez\] was able to generate an exploded view and Bill of Materials for each sub-assembly of the project. If you’ve ever needed [proof that NopSCADlib was worth checking out](https://hackaday.com/2019/06/15/try-nopscadlib-for-your-next-openscad-project/), this is it.
