JetBrains has released a new font with characteristics optimal for modern screen uses: JetBrains Mono.

Features:

*   Increased height for a better reading experience
*   Adapted to reading code
*   138 code specific characters
*   145 languages
*   4 weights with 4 matching italics
*   The font is free and open source

JetBrains Mono’s typeface forms are simple and free from unnecessary details. Rendered in small sizes, the text looks crisper. Even at small point sizes.

Style:

*   “1”, “l”, and “I” are all easily distinguishable from each other.
*   The zero has a dot inside. The letter “O” does not.
*   The comma’s shape differs from that of the period, making them easier to tell apart at small sizes. The same holds true for derived symbols, as well.

The easier the forms, the faster the eye perceives them and the less effort the brain needs to process them.

See [the JetBrains web page on the font](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) for all the details.
