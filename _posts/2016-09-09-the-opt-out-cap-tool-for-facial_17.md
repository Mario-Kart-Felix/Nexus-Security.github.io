Awesome project + write-up from [Mac Pierce](https://www.macpierce.com/blog/2019/11/4/the-opt-out-cap-assembly):

> The Opt-Out Cap is a tool for facial recognition obfuscation, taking the form of a baseball cap with concealed panels that can be deployed to block the wearer from being identified via massed facial recognition systems.
> 
> When used, the printed panels block the face of the wearer while displaying an alternative face, allowing for the user to disengage with the collection system without being automatically flagged as blocking their face.
