> One of the aspects that I most admire about paleoart is its educational potential. It can be used to make people interested in the natural sciences as well as science in general, and it can teach an audience about several concepts, such as evolution and environmental balance. So some of the work I’m most proud of is for books aimed at children and teens that have been published here in Brazil. These books feature our own paleontological history and inspire new generations to become scientists themselves.
