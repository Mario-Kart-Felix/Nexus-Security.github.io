> James Dean, who died in a 1955 car crash at the age of 24, is making an unexpected return to the big screen…. While _Finding Jack_ will be live action, _The Hollywood Reporter_ understands that Dean’s performance will be constructed via “full body” CGI using actual footage and photos. Another actor will voice him.

> “This opens up a whole new opportunity for many of our clients who are no longer with us,” said Mark Roesler, CEO of CMG Worldwide, which represents Dean’s family alongside more than 1,700 entertainment, sports, music and historical personalities, including the likes of Burt Reynolds, Christopher Reeve, Ingrid Bergman, Neil Armstrong, Bette Davis and Jack Lemmon.
