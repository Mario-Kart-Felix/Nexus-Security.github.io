Our good friend and highly experienced sonarman, Jive Turkey, continues to run one of the [most interesting YouTube channels](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9bMgCQyFNaMPsK9GtzM5dQ) for anyone who is fascinated with the art of undersea warfare. A year ago, we [featured an interview with Jive](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/24638/retired-submariner-turned-gamer-gives-amazing-video-explainers-on-sub-tactics-and-tech) and posted some of the incredible "whiteboard" explainer videos he produces on everything submarines. Just last summer, he filled us in on the [unique danger fire poses](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/28852/retired-u-s-navy-submariners-detail-why-fire-is-so-deadly-aboard-a-submarine) to submariners and has lent his expertise to us even on some of the more ["exotic" underwater issues](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/25784/what-u-s-submariners-actually-say-about-detection-of-so-called-unidentified-submerged-objects). Now he has posted a fascinating explainer of the differences between propellers and pump-jet propulsors used for propulsion on submarines and how detecting them on sonar differs, as well. 

Propellers and pump-jets are among the most important and sometimes sensitive components of a submarine class. The highly intricate design art that gives birth to these systems balances efficiency and speed, and even weight, against acoustic signature. It's a fascinating mix of material science, mechanical engineering, and hydrodynamics. 

Elaborate propeller configurations, some of which include unique vortex diffusers that you can [read all about here](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/26281/german-type-212-sub-has-this-propeller-boss-vortex-diffuser-to-reduce-its-acoustic-signature), are still commonplace on many submarines, but the pump-jet, with its unique advantages, has become increasingly in demand on larger submarines. Most importantly, they allow for higher speeds without [noisy cavitation](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/26281/german-type-212-sub-has-this-propeller-boss-vortex-diffuser-to-reduce-its-acoustic-signature)—which is a huge advantage when it comes to keeping from being detected while traversing vast swathes of ocean. 

Pump-jet propulsors also feature better efficiency across most all but the low-end of a submarine's performance envelope. They protect the blade elements contained within them. They can also be handy in shallow water, especially if they have a nozzle or deflecting surfaces for thrust vectoring. There are drawbacks, as well. They are heavy, making them ill-suited for many smaller submarine designs, and they are costlier and more complex than a propeller.  

Regardless, the pump-jet has come into its own after decades of far less widespread, but often experimental use. The two-thirds of the Royal Navy's [_Trafalgar_ class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafalgar-class_submarine) and later the U.S. Navy's [_Seawolf_ class](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/14309/why-the-navys-top-spy-submarine-flew-a-pirate-flag-while-pulling-into-port) were among the first standard production submarine designs to rely on the pump-jet propulsor configuration. Today, many other classes have followed suit. 

The U.S. Navy's [_Virginia_ class](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/24363/navy-wants-a-new-seawolf-like-attack-submarines-to-challenge-russian-chinese-threats) uses a similar arrangement as will the upcoming [_Columbia_ class](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/24804/navy-plans-for-large-payload-subs-based-on-new-columbia-class-to-take-on-ssgn-role-and-more) nuclear ballistic missile submarine that is currently in development. Overseas, the feature is becoming far more commonplace among allied and non-allied designs, with pump-jets being found of boats like the [Russian _Borei_](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/21073/watch-one-of-russias-newest-ballistic-missile-subs-launch-a-rare-four-missile-salvo) class and French [_Barracuda_ class](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/28949/france-launches-the-first-of-its-new-class-of-super-quiet-barracuda-attack-submarines). 

With that being said, I'll let Jive better explain the differences between the propulsion types, especially in regards to their tell-tail sound signature, in this awesome explainer video:
