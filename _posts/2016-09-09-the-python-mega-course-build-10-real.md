**Description**  
The Python Mega Course is the most practical course you will find on the web nowadays. Over 130 thousand students so far have used the course to learn Python programming and to build real-world applications in Python 3. You will learn how to build Python apps in this course even if you know nothing about programming. You will start from scratch and progressively build up your skills by creating some awesome Python programs ranging from webcam object detection apps to data collector web apps that query data from SQL databases to data visualization dashboards on the browser. The course has it all to make you an all-around Python programmer that not only knows Python but also the technologies you need to know to create professional applications.  
  
The course follows a modern-teaching approach where students learn by doing. You will start Python from scratch by creating simple programs first. Once you learn the basics, you will then start with the fun part which is building not less but 10 real-world applications. You will code the apps guided step-by-step by easy video explanations and continuous support by the course instructor. The applications you will build in the course consist of database apps, web apps, desktop apps, web scraping scripts, webcam object detectors, web maps, data visualization dashboards, and more. These programs are not only great examples to master Python, but you can also use them for your portfolio.  
  
By buying the course you will gain lifetime access to all its videos, coding exercises, quizzes, code notebooks, cheatsheets, and the Q&A inside the course where you can ask your questions and get an answer the same day. On top of that, you are covered by the Udemy 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can easily return the course if you don’t like it.  
  
If you don’t know anything about Python, do not worry! In the first 12 sections, you will learn Python basics such as functions, loops, and conditionals and learn how to apply the basics by doing some examples. If you already know the basics, then the first 12 sections can serve as a refresher. The other 20 sections focus entirely on building real-world applications. The applications you will build cover a wide range of interesting topics:  

*   Web applications
*   Desktop applications
*   Database applications
*   Web scraping
*   Web mapping
*   Data analysis
*   Data visualization
*   Computer vision
*   Object-Oriented Programming
*   A program that returns English-word definitions
*   A program that blocks access to distracting websites
*   A web map visualizing volcanoes and population data
*   A portfolio website
*   A desktop-graphical program with a database backend
*   A webcam motion detector
*   A web scraper of real estate data
*   An interactive web graph
*   A database web application
*   A web service that converts addresses to geographic coordinates
*   To consider yourself a professional programmer you need to know how to make professional programs and there’s no other course that teaches you that, so join thousands of other students who have successfully applied their Python skills in the real world.

How much time will I need to complete the course?  
  
**That depends on two factors:**  
(1) Your background: Someone coming from a math or computer science background may be able to take the course in a shorter time compared to someone coming from a social science background for example.  
  
(2) The effort you put: If you just watch the videos, you may take the course in two days. However, simply watching the videos is not enough. You need to experiment with the code you see in the videos. The more you experiment with it the better you become.  
  
Depending on the two factors I mentioned above, students spend from one week to three months to complete the course, most spending one month.  
  
I don’t know anything about programming. Will I still be able to learn Python?  
  
This course assumes you have no previous knowledge of programming. Whenever a programming term is mentioned (e.g. variable) the meaning of the term is explained thoroughly so you not only understand how to use that particular term in Python, you also understand what that term is in programming.  
  
Will I get support if I get stuck?  
  
Yes. Feel free to drop a question in the Q&A and me, or my teaching assistant will answer your questions within the same day.  
  
Does this course cover Python 2 or Python 3?  
  
Python 3  
  
What IDE/editor is used in the course?  
  
Visual Studio Code is used in the course. It is very new and probably the best IDE that exists today. However, you can use your favorite IDE. The code will work the same, no matter the IDE.  
  
**Does the course expire?**  
No. Once you buy the course it’s yours. I update the content regularly and all the updates are also included for free in the one-time purchase you make.  
  
**Who this course is for:**  

*   Those with no prior knowledge of Python.
*   Those who know Python basics and want to master Python.
