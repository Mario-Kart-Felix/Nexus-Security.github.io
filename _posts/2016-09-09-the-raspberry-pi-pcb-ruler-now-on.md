Ian Dunn has a Kickstarter going for a PCB ruler which includes the Raspberry Pi pinout. He writes:

> The moment I learned about PCB rulers I had to have one. But no PCB ruler that I could find on the internet was quite what I wanted, so I made my own! I put quite a bit of time and effort into perfecting this ruler, and I think the end product is really nifty. So, it seemed like a shame not to share it.
> 
> These rulers are rather expensive to manufacture in small batches, so I need your help! At minimum, I can sell the prototype batch that I already have manufactured, but I would really like to manufacture 1000 or more rulers.
> 
> I crammed every piece of information about the Raspberry PI and electronics that I could onto the ruler. My goal was to put every pin out, and formula that I use from time to time but I don’t quite remember in one easy place.
> 
> It’s exactly the right size to fit into a shirt pocket, and it’s very attractive. The finish is lead free ENIG (Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold.) The circuit board material is FR-4 with green solder mask.
