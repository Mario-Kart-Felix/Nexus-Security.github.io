It’s cold outside, there’s no kind of atmosphere, you’re all alone, more or less. More or less meaning that you share the gigantic mining ship that is your home on the other side of the galaxy with an ineffectual android, a humanoid descended from your cat, a holographic representation of your dead colleague who’s a complete _smeghead_, and a _really_ annoying sentient toaster that’s obsessed with bread products. If all this rings a bell, then maybe you’re familiar with the cult BBC TV series, _Red Dwarf_.  It’s a show that evidently \[Bill Dudley\] has spent too much time watching, because [he’s created a really convincing replica of that talking toaster](https://www.dudley.nu/projects/talkie-toaster/).

The base toaster is a toy appliance with a little clockwork ejector for toy toast, that comes with plenty of space inside and is easy to accessories for the classic Talkie Toaster look. Inside is an off-the-shelf MP3 player board and a home-made PCB which drives a set of LEDs behind the speaker grille in time with the audio. The result won’t make any toast, waffles, or even crumpets, but it will delight any _Red Dwarf_ fans who might be passing, whether someone has smoked them a kipper or not.

Surprisingly [this is not the first Talkie Toaster build we’ve seen](https://hackaday.com/2016/11/21/red-dwarfs-talkie-toaster-tests-tolerance/). If they met, would they have a harmonious conversation about bagels?
