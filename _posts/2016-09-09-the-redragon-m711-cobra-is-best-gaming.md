Purchasing budget items can always be a toss-up—you never know just how many corners they cut to offer such a low price. Redragon, however, aims to deliver a mouse that has all the features you want without breaking the bank.

I bought the [Redragon M711 Cobra](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0751D11BL/?tag=reviewgeek-20) earlier this year when I was looking for a cheap replacement for my previous mouse. I simply wanted a mouse that works; I didn’t care about getting a top of the line product. So, when the M711 arrived at my door, I was impressed with the number of options it has.

The M711 uses the popular “shooter” style mouse design. It’s reasonably slim (5 x 2.6 inches) and quite short (1.6 inches), so anyone who prefers larger mice might find it uncomfortable to use. The mouse has a curved, soft-feeling top that’s nice to the touch. The bottom part of the mouse is mostly made of smooth, hard plastic with slightly textured sides, which adds some grip to the mouse and a premium feel you wouldn’t expect at this price point.

Weighing in at 7.2 ounces, the M711 is easy to move around and ideal for games that require quick movements. The included USB cord is braided and feels durable. Because cords aren’t typically replaceable, an included high-quality one always gives some peace of mind.

Two thumb buttons are on the left side of the mouse. The front thumb button is made of the same material as the top of the mouse while the back thumb button is made of textured plastic. This helps with identifying which button you’re pressing without the need to look down.

Three plastic buttons on the top of the mouse are used for switching between lighting and DPI profiles. The scroll wheel has a rubber finish on it and scrolls in increments, making it hard to accidentally scroll further than intended—great for games with hotbars.

**Fully Featured**
------------------

As previously mentioned, the M711 has many additional features you can fine-tune in [Redragon’s website](https://www.redragonzone.com/products/redragon-m711-gaming-mouse). Really, any form of programming software is a luxury at this price point, so one as in-depth as this is especially appreciated.

The program allows for full reprogramming of each button on the mouse to do a wide range of actions. Whether you want the scroll wheel to act as a pause/play shortcut or the thumb button to execute a fine-tuned macro, you’re able to make those changes here. You can also fully control the DPI with a range of up to 10,000, which, frankly, is too high for most people, but having the option is nice regardless.

The M711 has full RGB lighting you can customize as well, but it’s limited. Only three of seven available lighting effects give you full control of the colors. Any effects that have multiple colors cannot be changed at all, which can be frustrating if you want to use them but aren’t a fan of the standard rainbow pattern.
