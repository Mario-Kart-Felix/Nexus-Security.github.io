[HiboTronix posts on Twitter](https://twitter.com/HiboTronix/status/1216458467675910146) about the recent availability of the design files for their DiscoBall RGB LED orb.

> Here are the DIY files so you can build your own DiscoBall. There are 3 main parts to DiscoBall, the centre, the alignment caps and the ribs. These files don’t include a portable power solution. I used a dc-dc converter, a lipo battery and charger that I could fit inside.
> 
> An [Adafruit PowerBoost1000 with a TP4056 lipo charger (with protection)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2465) should be ample if you use the standard brightness of 10.
> 
> Reference images are in the images folder. Arduino IDE setup instructions are in the Software folder. All the parts you require including the Gerbers required to have the PCBs manufactured are above, start by reading the assembly pdf. I wish you luck and I’d love to see it if you make one, catch me on Twitter (@HiboTronix) and/or tag it with #Discoball : )
