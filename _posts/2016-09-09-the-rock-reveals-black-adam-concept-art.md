It's been a while since we've heard anything about the Shazam spin-off movie Black Adam. Today, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson posted a release date on Instagram for the upcoming movie, which is more than a year away.

Coming to theaters on December 22, 2021, Johnson showed off some concept art as well. The art--which depicts Johnson as the villainous Black Adam--was created by legendary artist Jim Lee and [Boss Logic](https://twitter.com/Bosslogic). You can check it out below.

> [The Man in Black ⚡️ Like most kids growing up, I dreamed about being a superhero. Having cool superpowers, fighting for what’s right and always protecting the people. It all changed for me, when I was 10yrs old and was first introduced to the greatest superhero of all time - SUPERMAN. As a kid, Superman was the hero I always wanted to be. But, a few years into my fantasy, I realized that Superman was the hero, I could never be. I was too rebellious. Too rambunctious. Too resistant to convention and authority. Despite my troubles, I was still a good kid with a good heart - I just liked to do things my way. Now, years later as a man, with the same DNA I had as a kid - my superhero dreams have come true. I’m honored to join the iconic #DCUniverse and it’s a true pleasure to become, BLACK ADAM. BLACK ADAM is blessed by magic with the powers equal to SUPERMAN, but the difference is he doesn’t toe the mark or walk the line. He’s a rebellious, one of a kind superhero, who’ll always do what’s right for the people - but he does it his way. Truth and justice - the BLACK ADAM way. This role is unlike any other I’ve ever played in my career and I’m grateful to the bone we’ll all go on this journey together. BLACK ADAM 12.22.21 ⚡️ Huge thank you to my friends, @jimlee and @bosslogic for this first time ever bad ass collaboration.](https://www.instagram.com/p/B42odCrFF42/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)

The photo is accompanied by a long note from Johnson, proclaiming how excited he is to play the role. Originally, it was announced in 2014 that Black Adam was going to be the villain in the Shazam movie starring Zachary Levi--which came out earlier this year. For whatever reason, that never came to fruition, and in August of 2018, it was announced [Johnson would be starring in a solo Black Adam movie](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dcs-black-adam-to-be-standalone-movie-starring-the/1100-6447105/).

The comic book villain made his first appearance back in 1945 in the Fawcett Comics' series The Marvel Family. Years later, Black Adam, and the rest of the Marvel Family, arrived at DC Comics as the main antagonist of Shazam. In recent years, Black Adam has become more of a complex anti-hero rather than straight-up villain.

In DC continuity, the wizard Shazam gave Teth-Adam his powers thousands of years before Billy Batson got his. Teth-Adam began as a hero but slowly, he used his super-abilities for evil, letting his power corrupt him. Becoming Black Adam, the character was feared in his homeland. In recent years, he actions aren't always evil. He does things for the greater good, trying to lead humanity to a new era. However, some of his actions come with dire consequences.

Black Adam comes to theaters on December 22, 2021.
