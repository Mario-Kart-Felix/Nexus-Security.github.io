[Jay at back7 shows](https://back7.co/home/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit) that, while the Raspberry Pi is a great computer, it’s not set to go into the field as rugged equipment.

> Building Internet-connected things seems obvious today, but what about when there’s no Internet?
> 
> The concept often feels like something out of a science fiction movie or a doomsday prepper’s handbook- and while this device can work in both scenarios, it’s also about understanding resiliency for your projects and being a good steward of the systems in place today.

The resulting project is perfection – a ruggedized, waterproof case holds the Pi securely. Structured wiring brings out the connections. A display is integrated and a custom keyboard allows for input.
