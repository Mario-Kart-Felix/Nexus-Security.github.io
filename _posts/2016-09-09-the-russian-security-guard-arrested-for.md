The court began consideration of the case of a hacker from Novosibirsk, who was engaged in the theft of credentials gaming accounts right at the workplace in the Novosibirsk State Agrarian University, where he worked as a security guard. Data was subsequently sold over the Internet. The security guard was engaged in this activity not less than half a year.  
  
31-year-old former employee of a private security company for six months combined his hacker activity with work as a university security guard, this continued until January 2019. According to the materials of the case, the man downloaded hacker programs for stealing logins and passwords for popular gaming platforms, including Steam and the Rockstar Games and Electronic Arts services.  
  
The hacker sold the received data through the FunPay electronic exchange. The investigation was unable to establish the exact number of hacked accounts, but tracked the payment received by the hacker on the site. However, the business did not have high profitability, since in six months the hacker was able to earn only about 1.7 thousand rubles ($26).  
  
The security guard was caught by the FSB officers, calculating the origin of computer attacks by IP-address. The accused has fully admitted his guilt. Prosecutor's office demands for him two years suspended sentence, without payment of a fine.  
  
It is worth noting that this is not the first time in recent years, when a hacker appears in court in the case of hacking accounts with special software. For example, in June 2019, a hacker from Chelyabinsk was sentenced to 10 months in prison for hacking personal accounts of users in payment systems and accounts in social networks with the help of malware. But the hacker did not manage to steal money from the victims.
