A new video series about [Google Search Console](https://goo.gle/searchconsole) is rolling out on Youtube now! The series focuses on how to use Search Console to optimize your website for Google Search. In the videos we explain each of the reports available to you, giving examples on where to find data, how to analyze it, and how to fix issues that might affect your search appearance. We’ll have over a dozen episodes focusing on most of the features available on Search Console.  
  
As we [finished migrating](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/09/goodbye-old-search-console.html) to the new Search Console in 2019, we knew a detailed training video series would help users learn about the product and its many use cases. Below are the videos we have already released and there are many more to come! Check the [Search Console Training playlist](https://goo.gle/sct) for a new video every two weeks and subscribe to the [Webmasters YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/googlewebmasters?sub_confirmation=1) to get notified about new video uploads.  
  
  
I hope that by the end of the series you’ll agree with us that Search Console data is insightful, fun and exciting! Let us know what you think via commenting on videos or tagging us [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/googlewmc).
