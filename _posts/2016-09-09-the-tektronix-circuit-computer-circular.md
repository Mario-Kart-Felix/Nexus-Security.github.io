Ed Nisley at [The Smell of Molten Projects in the Morning blog](https://softsolder.com/2019/11/22/tektronix-circuit-computer-layout-analysis/) writes about the Tektronix Circuit Computer.

> Some searching reveals [the original version had three aluminum disks](https://vintagetek.org/tektronix-circuit-computer/), shaped and milled and photo-printed, with a honkin’ hex nut holding the cursor in place.

> TEK PN 003-023 (the paper edition) runs about thirty bucks (modulo the occasional outlier) on eBay, so we’re not dealing in priceless antiquity here. The manual is readily [available as a PDF](https://vintagetek.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Tektronix-Circuit-Computer.pdf), with photos in the back.
