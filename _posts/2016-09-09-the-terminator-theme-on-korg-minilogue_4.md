This is my attempt at the classic Terminator Theme on KORG Minilogue.

recorded everything “live” so no sequencing and that’s why it sounds sloppy (^???^) The track is made up of a pad section, two leads and a percussive sound. You can download the three Minilogue patches on My Patreon.

I used a lot of effects to make the leads sound like I wanted them too. Soundtoys Decapitator & Crystallizer. I also used Valhalla Shimmer & Valhalla Room. Also applied Multiband compression eq.
