Yesterday, Adam Savage of [Tested](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDJtJKMICpb9B1qf7qjEOA) welcomed Ben Eadie into the shop so that Ben could show him the chain mail he’s been making out of laser-cut EVA foam. The technique allows him to easily “weave” rows of the material together, turning a usually time-consuming and odious process into quick work.

The whole thing blew Adam’s neck bolts, especially the possibility of cutting mail out of leather to make breathable motorcycle jackets that could still offer protection. What could be more _Mad Max_\-ian than seeing bikers tooling around in leather chain mail?

Here’s Ben showing how it’s done in more detail.
