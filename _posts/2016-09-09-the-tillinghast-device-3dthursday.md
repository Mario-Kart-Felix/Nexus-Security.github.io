From [Propnomicon](http://propnomicon.blogspot.com/2020/01/the-tillinghast-device.html):

> This [recreation of the infamous Tillinghast device](https://syntheticrelics.com/collections/lamps/products/hp-lovecrafts-tillinghast-device) from Lovecraft’s “From Beyond” comes to us from Adam Houghton of Synthetic Relics. The field effect is a plexi panel illuminated with a fully interactive RGB LED array.
> 
> For your consideration, a modern re-imagining of the Tillinghast Device first referenced in the classic HP Lovecraft Tale: ‘From Beyond’.
> 
> _Physical descriptions of the device itself are minimal save for the presence of batteries, an arresting ghastly light, and scale such that it may rest upon Tillinghast’s desk. Certainly this allows a reader’s imagination to wander freely in conjuring it’s physical form in the mind’s eye. However its wondrous and psyche-shattering effects on all those who experience it’s terrible electrical power are described by Lovecraft in sickening detail. The waves generated by that small machine would act upon undiscovered sense organs in the human brain revealing vistas unknown to man and ‘overleap time, space, and dimensions’ to ‘peer to the bottom of creation’. Unfortunately for poor Tillinghast, something terrible peered back!_

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
