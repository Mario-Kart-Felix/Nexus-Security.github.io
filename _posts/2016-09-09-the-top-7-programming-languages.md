Via [dice.com](https://insights.dice.com/2019/10/14/7-programming-languages-employers-want/), which programming languages are most in-demand by employers? Important for those who want to leverage their skills to land a particularly high-paying job. Fortunately, a new list gives us a pretty accurate rundown, and it’s filled with the usual suspects: SQL, Java, JavaScript, Python, and so on.

Python
------

**It’s particularly worth paying attention to Python:** in addition to serving as an immensely popular general-purpose language, it’s really come into its own as a language for very specialized functions, including [machine learning](https://blog.adafruit.com/?s=machinelearning), [microcontrollers](https://www.CircuitPython.Org/) and finance IT. That’s a core reason why [a JetBrains survey from earlier this year](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/06/python-developers-survey-2018-results-python-usage-up-5-python-circuitpython-programming-thepsf/) named it the most-studied language among developers.

[A recent study by IEEE Spectrum](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/09/08/the-top-programming-languages-2019-python-tops-the-charts-with-a-circuitpython-nod-circuitpython-micropython-ieeespectrum-python/) also noted that employers want developers skilled in Python, Java, C, C++, and JavaScript, so these languages’ presence on the Burning Glass list should come as no surprise, either. All of these programming languages enjoy massive install bases across a variety of platforms, including mobile and the web; they’re also taught widely in schools and bootcamps, ensuring that there’s a steady pipeline of newly minted technologists who know them.
