Trello makes a fantastic Kanban-style digital organizer. You can use its intuitive features to maintain a shopping list, plan an event, monitor your job hunt, and to manage various other kinds of projects.

Once you start using Trello to track all the bits and pieces of your life, it’s a great idea to become familiar with Trello shortcuts to save yourself time. But given that there are so many shortcuts, it’s easy to miss quite a few of them, even crucial ones, or forget about them altogether.

That’s why we’ve come up with this cheat sheet. It lists various keyboard shortcuts, search operators, bookmarks, and Markdown elements that work in Trello. Dip into the cheat sheet anytime to discover or relearn a Trello trick or two!
