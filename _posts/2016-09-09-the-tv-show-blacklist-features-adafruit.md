Sharp-eyed watchers of the TV show The Blacklist caught that a character was disarming a device made with a bunch of Open Source parts.

We can see an [Adafruit large LED display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1264), [Perma Proto boards](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1609), a [Feather M0 LoRa](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3179), a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4296), and an Arduino Uno (with the name whited out by the builder) among various parts.

[Reddit user AngelofD](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/dkfany/screencap_from_the_latest_the_blacklist_i_see_a/) saw it also.
