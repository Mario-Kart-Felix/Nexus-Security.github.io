As it can be read on [**parliament.uk**](https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2020-01-16/4371), the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, [**Chris Skidmore**](http://chrisskidmore.com/), has stated:

> The deadline for implementing the EU Copyright Directive is 7 June 2021. The United Kingdom will leave the European Union on 31 January 2020 and the Implementation Period will end on 31 December 2020. The Government has committed not to extend the Implementation Period. Therefore, the United Kingdom will not be required to implement the Directive, and the Government has no plans to do so. Any future changes to the UK copyright framework will be considered as part of the usual domestic policy process.

Hence, the transposition of provisions like Articles 15 and 17 of that directive will not be part of the UK copyright debate ... at least for the time being.
