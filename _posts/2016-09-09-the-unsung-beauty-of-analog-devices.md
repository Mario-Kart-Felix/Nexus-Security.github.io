Via [Neil Panchal’s blog](https://neil.computer/notes/analog-devices-datasheets/) – If you are a circuit designer, you’ve probably seen manufacturer’s datasheets. The good, the bad, and the truly UGLY. Neil talks about good documentation, specifically that of Analog Devices.

> Each AD device is carefully analyzed, its performance characterized using sophisticated metrology setup and calibration. They share all this data for engineers to make better decisions, make fewer errors and know the limits of operation. There is much to learn from this. Not only do they provide specifications, but a physical evaluation board (at a cost) and free to use [reference designs](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/reference-designs/circuits-from-the-lab/CN0226.html).
> 
> They’re well-engineered with best practices and provide key insights into the operation of specific AD components. Furthermore, just looking at the reference design is enough to convince the engineer – barring costs (AD components are usually expensive), they make specific circuits extremely easy to implement and have reliable, predictable performance.

Neil states: “We need to do a better job of documentation anywhere and everywhere we work – no matter what type of job we have.”
