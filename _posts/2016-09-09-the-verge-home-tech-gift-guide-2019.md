**It can be difficult to find a way to express how grateful or thankful you are to your friends or family with a gift** — which is why they say it’s the thought that counts — but you still want to make sure you give them something good and not, like, rock hard fruit cake.

  

That’s why we brought together the greatest minds at _The Verge_ to compile our list of home and tech gift suggestions. So whether you need a gift for a co-worker, family member, good friend, or a secret Santa / white elephant party of strangers, we’ve got a variety of [great gift ideas](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20929348/holiday-gift-ideas-tech-phones-books-gadgets-christmas-hannukah-2019) for any budget from a $7 CB2 mug to the $399 Sonos Move.
