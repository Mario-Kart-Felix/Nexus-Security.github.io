At CES, Wacom unveiled its fantastic new tablet at a very affordable price. The Wacom One Drawing Tablet is the cheapest tablet in Wacom’s line. This makes it perfect for entry-level artists and designers, as well as social media gurus. It also makes a great purchase for someone who’s simply interested in drawing.

For $400, Wacom gives you a beautiful tablet with a 13-inch display. The Wacom One also offers an HD resolution of 1920 x 1080, as well as 72 percent NTSC color. That said, you’ll instantly notice how crisp and clean the tablet’s display looks.

Fortunately, the Wacom One’s performance is just as amazing as it looks. The device comes with a cordless pen that requires no charging. With a whopping 4,096 different pen pressure levels, you can execute precise photo edits and drawings that can take the form of sketches or even paintings. As soon as the stylus touches the tablet, you’ll notice how responsive it is—you’ll feel as if you’re drawing on a physical piece of paper.

You don’t even have to use Wacom’s included pen. It’s actually compatible with some of the most popular pen brands. The compatible pens include the Staedtler Noris Digital, Lamy Al-Star Black EMR, Mistubishi 9800 Pencil, Raytrektab DG-D08IWP, and even the Samsung Galaxy Note and Tab S Pen.

Speaking of compatibility, the Wacom One tablet isn’t just compatible with Windows and Mac either—it also works with Android. So far, you can link up your Wacom One with your newer Samsung phone (anything from the Samsung 8 to Note 10+), along with some Huawei phone models.

Want even more features alongside your Wacom One tablet? The Wacom One comes with a bonus pack that includes exceptional creative tools. When you buy the Wacom One, you’ll get a bonus pack with Clip Studio Paint, Bamboo Paper, and Adobe Premiere Rush CC. In the future, this pack will also include the Adobe Fresco drawing software.

Whether you’re a budding designer or interested in the artistic field, the [Wacom One Drawing Tablet](https://www.amazon.com/Wacom-Drawing-Display-Beginners-DTC133W0A/dp/B082LZXQ6B) is definitely worth it for the price! This versatile tablet is on sale now, so make sure to get your hands on it.
