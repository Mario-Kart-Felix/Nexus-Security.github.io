The Internet Archive has released a great new feature! Pages can now be saved in snapshot form which is great for referencing things or creating citations.

> Save Page Now (SPN) just got a major upgrade as a result of a total code rewrite, adding a slew of new and awesome features, with more on the way.
> 
> When users are logged in with their free Archive.org account, SPN-generated archives can be saved to that user’s “My web archive” public gallery of archived pages.
> 
> In addition to capturing more high-quality archives of web page elements (HTML, JavaScript, Image files, etc.), SPN can now also produce a screenshot. If screenshots of archived pages are available, we will display an icon on corresponding playback pages and if selected the screenshot will be shown.

Have you ever wanted to archive all the web pages linked from an email message?  Well, you are in luck because now you can forward that email to “savepagenow@archive.org” and after a few minutes you will get an email back filled with Wayback Machine playback URLs.

URLs embedded in a web-based PDF file, RSS feed, or JSON file can be archived. The new SPN will parse those files and archive all the URLs they contain.  To use this feature, simply submit PDF/RSS or JSON URLs to SPN, and don’t forget to select the “capture outlinks” checkbox.
