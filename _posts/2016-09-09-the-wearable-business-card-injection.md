Check out this [automated business card dealing device](https://twitter.com/seevua/status/1192985155209699328?s=11) posted on Twitter by [@seevua](https://twitter.com/seevua)!

We can see it uses an Adafruit Pro Trinket as the microcontroller and has a motor which feeds cards out when activated. Very clever.
