For two weeks, the website of the Echo of Moscow radio station and the computers of its employees have been hacked.  
  
According to Sergey Buntman, First Deputy Editor-in-Chief of Echo, the radio station technically and actually proved that there are attacks not only on the Echo of Moscow website but also on the Echo office, and on computers, computer and Internet communications. Because of this, part of the telephone service is also affected.  
  
"We asked for help wherever we could, both technical, political, and law enforcement agencies. We linked these attacks with certain information, programs. Law enforcement agencies, as I understand it, are now searching for the source of the attacks," said Alexey Venediktov, Editor-in-Chief of Echo.  
  
He said that two weeks ago, powerful hacker attacks began. Their peculiarity was that they attacked not only the site but also the communication channels of Echo of Moscow when programs were broadcast with presenters who are located remotely," explained Venediktov.  
  
In addition, office computers were unexpectedly attacked, due to which Echo Moscow could not receive news from news agencies. "It is very important that they attack Internet communication channels, including from the satellite from which our regional partners receive the signal. These are very experienced, very powerful DDoS attacks. As experts tell us, very large structures have such capabilities," he said, adding that the radio station's specialists have already learned to repel all these attacks.  
  
However, according to Venediktov, the radio station is losing subscribers and advertisers. The Editorial Board drew the attention of the shareholders to this fact, and "the shareholders are worried".
