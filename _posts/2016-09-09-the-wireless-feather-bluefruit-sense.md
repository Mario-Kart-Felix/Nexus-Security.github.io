Our new Feather Bluefruit Sense is available in the adafruit shop – its jam-packed with temperature, humidity, pressure, sound, light/color/proximity, and motion/orientation sensors ([video](https://youtu.be/yJs2y2HMmiw)). Even has a lil button! How to test it out? Melissa coded up a dashboard in javascript, using a Chrome browser you can visit the webpage, pair with the Feather and display all this data wirelessly! The dashboard is comin’ soon, and you can grab a feather now at [https://www.adafruit.com/bluefruitsense](https://www.adafruit.com/bluefruitsense)
