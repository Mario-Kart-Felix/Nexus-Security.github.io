If an advertisement that recently appeared on Twitch is any indication, it looks like [The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt](https://www.gamespot.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/) is on its way to Xbox Game Pass. If that's the case, you'll soon be able to play [GameSpot's 2015 Game of the Year](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-3-wins-overall-game-of-the-year-at-2015-ga/1100-6432780/) for as little as [$1](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-one-deal-get-3-months-of-game-pass-ultimate-f/1100-6471412/).

Reddit user [tombonez](https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/dw9f1j/the_witcher_3_revealed_as_coming_to_xbox_game/) initially spotted the ad for Xbox Game Pass on Twitch. The sizzle reel showcases The Witcher 3's inclusion along with titles currently available on the service such as [Gears 5](https://www.gamespot.com/gears-5/) and [The Outer Worlds](https://www.gamespot.com/the-outer-worlds/). With Microsoft set to announce Game Pass news during [X019](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/x019-inside-xbox-livestream-start-time-and-how-to-/1100-6471272/) later today, it stands to reason that The Witcher 3 will be part of the festivities.

Aside from winning Game of the Year in 2015, The Witcher 3 also received one of GameSpot's [elusive 10/10](https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamespot-1010-review-score/2900-153/) review scores. A [Netflix Witcher series](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-the-witcher-series-gets-new-trailer-and-r/1100-6471025/) is also on the way and has already been [renewed](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-has-been-renewed-for-season-2-by-netfl/1100-6471407/) for a second season.
