The much-anticipated fantasy show The Witcher finally hits Netflix next month, with Henry Cavill starring as Geralt of Rivia. Although a couple of trailers have been released so far, don't expect to see any reviews of the show until just before it's available. Nevertheless, Netflix is clearly confident about the show's potential, and has greenlit Season 2.

The announcement was tweeted by Netflix, with the caption "Geralt's adventure is only beginning." That's all we know so far--unsurprisingly, there's no release date, but with Season 1 not here for another month, don't expect see Season 2 for at least a year. Check the tweet out below:

The [latest trailer](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-the-witcher-series-gets-new-trailer-and-r/1100-6471025/) for The Witcher Season 1 was released last month, while the [first promo](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-netflixs-trailer-is-full-of-monsters-a/1100-6468551/) was revealed back in July. The show also stars Anya Chalotra as Yennefer, and Freya Allan as Ciri, and it hits Netflix on December 20.

Ahead of the series landing on Netflix, why not play Witcher 3 again landing on Netflix so why not play [Witcher 3](https://www.gamespot.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/) again, on [Switch](https://www.gamespot.com/nintendo-switch/)? In his review of the Nintendo port, Jacob Dekker gave The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt an 9/10 (while the PC, Xbox One, and PS4 versions received a 10/10), and in the [review](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-nintendo-switch-review-the-last-wish/1900-6417341/), Dekker said, "Although the Nintendo Switch might not be the best platform to play The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, it's still a fantastic experience that shouldn't be missed. If you are looking to replay The Witcher 3 and bask in its detail and beauty, the Switch port may not quite scratch that itch. However, what makes this game excellent isn't its graphics, but the powerful stories it tells, and those are as vivid as ever on Switch."
