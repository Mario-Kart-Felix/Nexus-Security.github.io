A follow up to [our previous post!](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/11/26/adafruit-joins-the-zephyr-project-and-linux-foundation-zephyriot-zephyriot-linuxfoundation-linux-adafruit/) [The Zephyr Project Welcomes Adafruit Industries to its Open Source Ecosystem](https://www.zephyrproject.org/the-zephyr-project-welcomes-adafruit-industries-to-its-open-source-ecosystem/) –

> [The Zephyr™ Project](https://www.zephyrproject.org/), an open source project at the [Linux Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/) that builds a safe, secure and flexible real-time operating system (RTOS) for the Internet of Things (IoT) in space-constrained devices, kicks off 2020 by welcoming new member Adafruit Industries and displaying new solutions at Embedded World on February 25-27 in Nuremberg, Germany.
> 
> Adafruit makes open source hardware, tutorials and code for makers to create DIY electronic products. Adafruit joins member companies including Antmicro, Eclipse Foundation, Foundries.io, Intel, Linaro, Nordic Semiconductor, NXP®, Oticon, SiFive, Synopsys, Texas Instruments and more to create an open hardware and software ecosystem using the Zephyr OS.
> 
> “We see amazing increases in computing power on edge microcontrollers, and the new wireless technologies coming out allow connectivity for short and long range networks,” said Limor “Ladyada” Fried, Founder & Engineer at [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/). “Managing the complexities and security requirements of IoT requires a powerful RTOS that makes development and deployment easy. Zephyr is the leading RTOS we see for cross-platform development and well-thought-out security needs.”
> 
> “Adafruit has been making open source hardware for more than a decade and has been a key driver and influencer in the open source community,” said Kate Stewart, Senior Director of Strategic Projects for The Linux Foundation. “Their expertise will be essential to the expansion of the Zephyr ecosystem and deployment of the functional safety and security for the RTOS. We are excited to welcome them into our community and look forward to collaborating  with them.”
