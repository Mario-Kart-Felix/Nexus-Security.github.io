------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Inspired by https://ift.tt/36heLFF, but needing a slightly different design, I designed this working\[\*\] light saber for my son, Theo, for his 2019 Halloween costume. Designed after Luke’s lightsaber from Return of the Jedi, the Theosaber is an elegant prop for a more civilized age.
> 
> The handle is designed to mate with the end cap, which is held in place with two set screws. The cap has room to hold a 500 mAh LiPo rechargeable battery, or a 9V battery. The handle has room for a power button, rotary switch (e.g., to control color or brightness), and an LED module. Instructions on building it out below.
> 
> \[\*\] Well, it lights up.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!

The [Adafruit Learning System](http://learn.adafruit.com) has dozens of great tools to get you well on your way to creating incredible works of engineering, interactive art, and design with your 3D printer! If you’ve made a cool project that combines 3D printing and electronics, be sure to let us know, and we’ll [feature](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) it here!
