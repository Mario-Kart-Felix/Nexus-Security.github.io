iPhone
------

  

Starting on Thanksgiving and continuing through Black Friday, Best Buy will host a few carrier deals for the iPhone 11 and the iPhone 11 Pro. If you’re looking for a discount on an iPhone 11 Pro, [you may be able to buy one for as little as $499 (roughly half off)](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fiphone%2Fshop-iphone-11-iphone-11-pro-and-iphone-11-pro-max%2Fpcmcat1568147641595.c), but only if you activate a new line with an installment plan on Verizon, AT&T, or Sprint, and also trade in your old phone. How much you pay overall will depend on how much trade-in value your phone has.

Google Pixel
------------

  

Available now through December 1st, Target will offer a $300 gift card [when you activate a Google Pixel 4 or Google Pixel 4 XL](https://fave.co/33GeIBX) with an installment plan on Verizon or AT&T.

  

If you’re on the hunt for an unlocked Pixel 4 or Pixel 4 XL, you can get $200 off of all configurations from various retailers from now through December 2nd.

  

*   Pixel 4 is $599 at [Amazon](https://amzn.to/36NspRF), [Best Buy](https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flearn-about-google-pixel-4%2Fgoogle-pixel-4-shop-by-carrier%2Fpcmcat1570497903420.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1570497903420), [Google Store](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_4) and [B&H Photo](https://fave.co/2X3qmo4)
