\[Foaly\] has been hard at work making an open-source long range camera remote, and recently [shared a deeply thoughtful post about how it is never too early to consider all aspects of design, lest it cost you in the end](https://silica.io/silver-project-update-making-the-case-then-throwing-everything-out-and-starting-again-from-scratch/). It all started with designing an enclosure for a working prototype, and it led to redesigning the PCB from scratch. That took a lot of guts, and we recommend you make some time to click that link and read up on what he shared. You’ll either learn some valuable tips, or just enjoy nodding sagely as he confirms things you already know. It’s win-win.

Note the awkward buttons right next to the antenna connector, for example.

The project in question is [Silver](https://hackaday.io/project/167218-silver), and calling it a camera remote is selling it a bit short. In any case, \[Foaly\] had a perfectly serviceable set of prototypes and needed a small batch of enclosures. So far so normal, but in the process of designing possible solutions, \[Foaly\] ran into a sure-fire sign that a project is in trouble: problems cropping up everywhere, and in general everything just seeming harder than it should be. Holding the mounting-hole-free PCB securely never seemed quite right. Buttons were awkward to reach, ill-proportioned, and didn’t feel good to use. The OLED screen’s _component_ was physically centered, but the _display_ was off-center which looked wrong no matter how the lines of the bezel were sculpted. The PCB was a tidy rectangle, but the display ended up a bit small and enclosures always looked bulky by the time everything was accounted for. The best effort is shown here, and it just didn’t satisfy.

This isn’t necessarily a problem for a one-off, but from a product design perspective it led to so many problems that it was better to start over, this time being mindful of how everything integrates right from the start: the layout, the components, the mechanical bits, the assembly, and the ultimate user experience. The end result is wonderful, and we’re delighted \[Foaly\] took the time to document his findings.

Enclosure design is a big deal and there are many different ways to go about it.
