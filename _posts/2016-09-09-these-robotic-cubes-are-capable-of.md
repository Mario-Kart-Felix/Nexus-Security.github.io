Researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have developed **self-assembling robotic cubes dubbed M-Block** capable of climbing and rolling across the ground. These cubes are the [second version of the project](https://news.mit.edu/2013/simple-scheme-for-self-assembling-robots-1004) MIT unveiled back in 2013.  

With the new iteration, these M-Block cubes have gained the capability to communicate with one another using a “barcode-like system” present on each face of the cube. This system is used for performing various tasks like forming a line or following a path.  

Each M-Block has **a flywheel that does 20,000 revolutions per minute**. Permanent magnets are equipped on each face so that cubes could attach to each other.  

The researchers aim to improve M-Blocks to be used in disaster management situations. For instance, the researchers suggest these robotic cubes could be used for rescue operations by building a staircase in a building on fire.  

_“The unique thing about our approach is that it’s inexpensive, robust, and potentially easier to scale to a million modules. M-Blocks can move in a general way. Other robotic systems have much more complicated movement mechanisms that require many steps, but our system is more scalable.”,_ says John Romanishin, lead author of the paper.  

During testing, the researchers scattered the blocks and made them align to a line. At the end of the experiment, they noted that 90 percent of the blocks managed to form a line. Incredible, indeed.  

I hope these robotic cubes technology mature enough to be a practical application rather than ending up in the laboratory considering the proposed use-case. So, what are your thoughts on these self-assembling modular robots? Tell us in the comments.
