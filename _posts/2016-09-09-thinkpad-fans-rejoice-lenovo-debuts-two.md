The ThinkCentre M90a All-in-One wasn’t the only new computer that Lenovo debuted at CES 2020; we also saw the introduction of two updated ThinkPad X1 laptops.

The most significant upgrades can be found in the displays. The 8th generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon (8th-gen) now comes with 500 nits of brightness and a 4K touchscreen (a non-touch version is also available). You also get 10th-gen Intel processors, Dolby Atmos speakers, and 18.5 hours of battery. The ThinkPad X1 Carbon will be available in the spring for $1,499.

A refreshed ThinkPad X1 Yoga (5th-gen) will also hit the shelves in 2020, though probably a couple of months later than the X1 Carbon. Like the Carbon, the Yoga has a 500-nit 4K display and 10th-gen processors. It weighs 2.9 pounds and offers 15 hours of battery.

Both the machines now have Wi-Fi 6 support, 16GB of RAM, and a 2TB SSD drive.

Further improvements are found in the keyboards. The scissor mechanism is still used, but there are now dedicated buttons for instant Voice-over-IP access. For anyone who regularly uses Skype or other similar services, they will be a big time-saver.

Lenovo’s PrivacyGuard is available on both machines. It gives the display a narrow viewing angle to prevent other people from surreptitiously spying at whatever is on your screen.

The Yoga is both the heavier (2.86 pounds) and the thicker (15.25mm) of the two new products. The Carbon comes in at 2.4 pounds and 14.9mm.

Elsewhere in the company’s 2020 product lineup, Lenovo continued its push into the smart office sector with an all-new business communications device, the ThinkSmart View. The portable video chat device joins the company’s growing list of ThinkSmart office products.

The ThinkSmart View has an 8-inch touchscreen and is powered Qualcomm’s APQ8053 processor, making the device a powerful tool for anyone who relies on Microsoft Teams or Zoom.
