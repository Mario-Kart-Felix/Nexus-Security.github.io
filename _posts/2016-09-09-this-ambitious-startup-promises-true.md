The ability to offer true wireless charging (i.e not having to place it on a charging pad) is something even renowned technology giants have not figured out yet. But, a California-based startup company called Guru claims to have developed infrastructure to make true wireless power transmission possible. It will showcase its technology at CES 2020.  

Guru has a wireless charging system that **uses high-frequency radio waves** ([millimeter wave](https://beebom.com/what-is-massive-mimo/)) as a medium to transmit electricity. You can expect three prototypes of the Guru’s technology at CES later this week.  

In an exclusive first look to [_The Verge_](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21044650/guru-wireless-charging-mmwave-cordless-over-the-air-radio-waves-ces-2020), the company explained how the technology works behind the scenes. The aforesaid three prototypes include a desk charging system capable of charging any gadget within its radius, a more powerful prototype that could potentially power any gadget in a room, and a robot that moves around to charge smart home products.  

_“The idea of sending power of distance is not new. Nikola Tesla had that same idea that power should be sent wirelessly,”_ CEO & co-founder Florian Bohn said in the interview. _“What makes us different is we’re using very advanced technology as well as our system design and mmWave technology that allows us to send power in a controlled and safe and effective manner.”_  

While numerous startups have tried and failed to implement a robust true wireless power transmission system in the past, Guru counts on two major parameters – **mmWave** and the company’s proprietary **Smart RF Lensing**.  

Smart RF Lensing technology enables Guru to beam energy to tiny receivers, which makes the technology more scalable. _“One of our strengths as a company is our tech has this versatility of usage — lower-power short distances up to very large power over long distances. The differences being the size and the cost point of the end product,”_ Bohn added.  

I know, all of this sounds amazing but there is a catch. Since the devices in the consumer market don’t natively support the company’s cutting-edge charging methodology, installing a **physical receiver is mandatory to make the device compatible** with Guru’s charging system. The charging speed is also relatively low when compared with wall chargers and comes closer to Qi wireless chargers.
