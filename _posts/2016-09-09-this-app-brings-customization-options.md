Not a fan of the limited functionality of  Android 10’s gesture navigation system? Don’t worry, this new app named gesturePlus from Jawomo has got you covered. Notably, Jawomo is the same app developer behind [bxActions](https://beebom.com/how-remap-bixby-button-without-root/) – the app for remapping the Bixby button and [sideActions](https://beebom.com/remap-s-pen-button-galaxy-note-10/) – the app for remapping the S Pen.  

With gesturePlus, you get the extra customization features that you always wanted. The app **lets you set a variety of actions when you press or long-press the navigation bar**. By default, the app performs a back gesture when you tap on the navbar. You can also separately define single and long-press actions for the lock screen.  

You have the flexibility to choose to open an app or perform a shortcut action of your choice whenever you tap on the navigation bar. You can even set the navigation bar to trigger Google Assistant, which might come in handy.  

What’s more, the app lets you toggle the gesture sensitivity and long-press trigger duration. You can also choose to get a vibration whenever the long-press gesture is triggered.  

It is worth noting that **you’re limited to single press actions in the free version** of the app. The **pro version costs Rs. 150** and unlocks a few other features including the ability to turn the screen off, toggling split-screen, peek actions, taking a screenshot and more.  

If you have a Samsung device, you can disable the default back navigation gesture. However, do note that it requires running an [ADB command](https://beebom.com/how-to-install-adb-windows-mac/) given below.  

```
adb shell pm grant com.jamworks.besturenavigation android.permission.WRITE\_SECURE\_SETTINGS
```
