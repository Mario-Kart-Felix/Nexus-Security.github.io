Black Friday is **FEATHER FRIDAY** here at Adafruit this year! In addition to our 15% off site-wide sale we are offering 20% off products from our Feather line of development boards and accessories for ONE DAY ONLY.

Use code **ADATHANKS** to get a 20% discount \*only\* on Feather products! All other items will be 15% off. (Discount does not apply to gift certificates, subscriptions and software.) We also do not permit the use of discount codes on purchase orders.

The code is valid on Friday, November 29th until 11:59 PM EST. We cannot cancel previous orders or add the discount once your order is placed so **please remember to use the code**!

Orders placed on Saturday, Sunday or Monday using the **ADATHANKS** code will receive 15% off but will not receive the 20% discount on Feathers.
