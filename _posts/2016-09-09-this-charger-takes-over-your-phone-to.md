The [Facebook Amazon Netflix Google Obfuscator](http://martinnadal.eu/fango/) \[FANGo\] will look like an ordinary lightning charger (or similar). By randomly browsing the internet when plugged in, the FANGo will render your precious consumer data useless. Excellent idea from [Martin Nadal](http://martinnadal.eu/fango/):

> Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google were grouped under the acronym FANG as the most important and high-performing companies of the NASDAQ and pioneers of what is known today as surveillance capitalism.

> While the phone is charging, the microcontroller will perform searches, videos will be seen on YouTube will be given likes to Facebook posts, all these interactions will be captured by the data brokers without knowing that they are automatic, noise with the sole intention of worsening the quality of the data captured.
