The would-be invader of a mediaeval kingdom could expect to face some stern opposition from a variety of formidable weaponry. Making modern versions of these deadly curiosities seems to be a popular pursuit, and the bug has bitten \[Turbo Conquering Mega Eagle\], who’s created what he calls a “Stonebow”, [a crossbow on steroids that fires stones or large ball bearings with considerable force](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3yhTMGTjx0).

It uses a couple of leaves from automotive springs, mounted in a welded steel riser with two strings and a pouch for the projectile. The barrel is an oak fencing post, and at its other end is a cocking lever which also forms a stock, and a cleverly designed trigger mechanism. The projectile is loaded, the bow is cocked, and it is fired at a scrap Land Rover radiator in which it places a satisfying impact mark.

Despite two successful firings it’s evident that so much force isn’t easy to contain. The crimps that secure the strings aren’t up to the job, and neither is the oak fence post, which has cracked at the end. We trust that our Essex hacker friend will return having fixed these flaws, and more defenceless scrap car parts will be sacrificed for our entertainment.

We’ve featured \[Turbo Conquering Mega Eagle\] before, most recently [building a mini-bike for his youngsters](https://hackaday.com/2019/11/16/this-is-the-bike-you-wanted-your-dad-to-make-you-when-you-were-eight-years-old/). Meanwhile, enjoy the Stonebow in the video below the break.
