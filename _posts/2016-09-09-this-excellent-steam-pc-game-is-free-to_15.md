Steam regularly has free periods where you can play a game all weekend, but you usually have to buy it if you want to keep playing past Sunday. However, this weekend is different, and with Black Friday just around the corner, Steam and publisher Sega are offering free digital copies of [Company of Heroes 2](https://www.gamespot.com/company-of-heroes-2/) until November 17 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET.

All you have to do to get your free game is go to [Company of Heroes 2's Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/231430/Company_of_Heroes_2/), add it to your cart, and then checkout as if you were buying the game normally. You won't be charged, and it'll still be yours to keep forever. Sega is also discounting much of the game's DLC, so if you find you enjoy the game, you can pick some of it up at a cheaper price.

GameSpot's [Company of Heroes 2 review](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/company-of-heroes-2-review/1900-6410716/) scored the real-time strategy game a 7.5/10. "Such multiplayer mayhem recalls the original Company of Heroes' best moments, and you couldn't accuse this sequel of reaching the heights of the classic that spawned it," critic Kevin Van Ord wrote.

"This familiarity is unlikely to breed much contempt, however, given Company of Heroes 2's consistent level of enjoyment. Its barrage of online and offline skirmishes doesn't always hit its mark. But when it finds its target, Company of Heroes 2 delivers a loud and mighty payload."

In related news, Steam is offering a free-play weekend for the tactical FPS, [Squad](https://www.gamespot.com/squad/). If you enjoy playing it, you can grab it for 50% off all weekend--$20 USD, $25 CAD, or Â£16.25. Other games on sale include 2016's [Doom](https://www.gamespot.com/doom/), [Watch Dogs 2](https://www.gamespot.com/watch-dogs-2/), and [Street Fighter 5](https://www.gamespot.com/street-fighter-v/), among others.
