Radio control is good and all, and it’s always fun to watch a little vehicle scoot about the backyard. But there’s always something to be said for feeling as though you’re really in control. First person view, or FPV, is the way to do it, and [\[Brian\] has gone down that route with this tidy tank build](https://hackaday.io/project/164896-rc-fpv-tank-rover).

The tank is 3D printed, from the chassis right down to the wheels. There’s even a moving “eye” up front containing the FPV camera, controlled by a servo, allowing the driver to look up and down. A 5.8 GHz transmitter is used to send the signal back to the driver’s goggles. The tracks are a snap-together design that are fully 3D printed, requiring no additional metal links or hardware. Forward propulsion is courtesy of a pair of 12 volt gear motors, driven from an L298N motor driver. An Arduino Nano is used in conjunction with Spektrum RC gear to receive signals and tell the tank where to go.

It’s a tidy build that would be great fun to drive through the bushes or through the house. [We’ve seen even tinier builds used to inspect crawlspaces.](https://hackaday.com/2019/06/18/tiny-tank-inspects-your-crawlspace/) If you build one of your own, [be sure to let us know.](http://hackaday.com/submit-a-tip)
