An iOS designer is building an iPhone application that will transform the cell phone into an iPod Classic with its nostalgic snap wheel. Elvin Hu, a plan understudy at Cooper Union school in New York City, has been taking a shot at the task since October, and shared an early take a gander at the application on Twitter yesterday. It basically transforms your iPhone into a fullscreen iPod Classic with a tick wheel that incorporates haptic criticism and snap sounds simply like Apple's unique gadget.  
  
It has created a ton of enthusiasm on Twitter, with even the "father of the iPod," Tony Fadell, noticing it's a "decent return." Hu manufactured the application since he was taking a shot at a paper about the advancement of the iPod at school. "I've generally been a fanatic of Apple items since I was a child," uncovered Hu in an email to The Verge. "Before my family could manage the cost of one, I would draw the UI design of iPhone on covers of Ferrero Rocher boxes. Their items (among different items, for example, Windows Vista and Zune HD) have significantly affected my choice of seeking after plan as a vocation."

Transformed my iPhone into an iPod Classic with Click Wheel and Cover Flow with #SwiftUI  
  
Regardless of whether we'll ever get the opportunity to play with it ourselves will generally rely upon Apple, however. "I've been chipping away at this undertaking since October and whether I can discharge it or not depends on whether Apple favor it," conceded Hu. "I accept they have genuine reasons not to (licenses and different reasons)."  
  
The application additionally incorporates Apple's old Cover Flow include, a 3D graphical interface that allows you to parchment and flip through collection and melody fine art to choose tracks. Hu has incorporated this with the area over the snap wheel, and it likewise works in scene mode.

Making an iOS music application that resembles Cover Flow in #SwiftUI...  
  
On the off chance that Apple blocks the discharge, which is likely, at that point Hu may "discharge it as an open source venture in the wake of seeing the reaction from the network." The application is still being developed, and Hu is intending to finish it before the finish of December, thinks about allowing. In the event that Apple isn't content with the application, we can dare to dream that somebody on the iOS group has a heart loaded with sentimentality and includes this as a definitive Easter egg for Apple Music and iPod fans.
