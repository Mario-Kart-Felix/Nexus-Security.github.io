Learning a second (or third or fourth) language is a great way to unlock culture and make friends. While textbooks are pretty dry, there are now many apps that will help you master foreign tongues. [Babbel](https://deals.makeuseof.com/sales/babbel-lifetime-subscription-all-languages?utm_source=makeuseof.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=babbel-lifetime-subscription-all-languages&utm_term=scsf-362589&utm_content=a0x1P000004N6R6&scsonar=1) is one of the best, with speech recognition technology and content created by over 100 linguists. Now is your last chance to grab lifetime access to [all 14 language courses for $159](https://deals.makeuseof.com/sales/babbel-lifetime-subscription-all-languages?utm_source=makeuseof.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=babbel-lifetime-subscription-all-languages&utm_term=scsf-362589&utm_content=a0x1P000004N6R6&scsonar=1) at the MakeUseOf Shop.

Start Speaking Faster
---------------------

Many language learning apps make you learn loads of useless words before you get to everyday language. In three months, you might be able to say “the tortoise is eating sugar” but you can’t respond to “how are you?”

In contrast, Babbel helps you master everyday language faster. You learn through fun mini games and pictures quizzes that cover travel, family, business, and food. Once you have mastered some words and phrases, Babbel asks you to speak aloud. The app uses speech recognition to provide live feedback.

Learning with Babbel takes 10–15 minutes each day, and you can take your lessons offline. The app offers 14 languages in total, including Spanish, French, Portuguese, Russian, and more.
