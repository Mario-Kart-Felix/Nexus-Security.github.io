> A shimmering rock found in the ruins of an ancient city has been identified as part of a human brain that exploded due to the heat of a catastrophic volcanic eruption.
> 
> That’s the astonishing conclusion of a new study [published on Thursday](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1909867?query=featured_home) in _The New England Journal of Medicine_, led by Pier Paolo Petrone, a forensic anthropologist at the University of Naples Federico II.
> 
> “The preservation of ancient brain remains is an extremely rare finding, but this is the first ever discovery of ancient human brain remains, vitrified by heat at about 950°F produced by a volcanic eruption,” Petrone said in an email.
