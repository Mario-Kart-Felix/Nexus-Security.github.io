To make the lives of blind people better, a company named YGA has developed a smart walking stick that it calls WeWalk Smart Cane. The product attaches itself to a normal cane and expands its accessibility features.  

The smart cane provides users with warnings regarding obstacles found at their body and face levels, thanks to its **obstacle detection** feature made possible by ultrasonic sensors equipped in the device. This is a lifesaving feature in my opinion since a lot of blind people get hurt from obstacles at their face level without realizing its presence.  

Making the experience even more seamless, the cane **pairs with smartphones** through Bluetooth. Moreover, the touchpad present in the cane can be used to control the smartphone and access some necessary features like voice assistant and navigation.  

The device charges through a micro-USB port. In terms of battery life, WeWalk claims 20 hours of battery life on a single charge.  

Coming to the pricing and availability, the WeWalk smart cane is **priced at $499** and comes with 1 year of warranty. The company also has worldwide shipping through UPS, TNT or FedEx, in case you’re wondering.  

It is worth noting that the CEO and co-founder of YGA, Kursat Ceylan is himself a blind person. _“Beyond being just a product, WeWALK is a social platform and a movement which unites all blind people in the world, creates awareness in society, and fosters accessibility, social inclusion, more and equal participation in social life,”._  

Being an open platform, WeWalk aims to integrate support for ride-hailing apps like Uber in the near future as the next step to expand the product’s usability.
