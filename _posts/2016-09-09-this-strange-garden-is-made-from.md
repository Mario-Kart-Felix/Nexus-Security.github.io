> This is [Pause](http://www.asianart.org/layouts/pause), a new site-specific installation at San Francisco’s Asian Art Museum. Artist [Jean Shin](http://www.jeanshin.com/) used e-waste from the Bay Area, a leading tech hub, to design the sort of Zen rock garden that’s typically meant to capture the essence of nature and provide a setting for contemplation and spiritual connection.
> 
> It’s a place for unplugging made solely from materials that require plugging in.
> 
> “Ultimately, Pause is an installation of and about technology, but without electricity, Wi-Fi, flashing lights, moving images or sound,” said Mark Mayer, assistant curator of contemporary art and programs at the museum.
