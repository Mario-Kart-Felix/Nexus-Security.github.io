Clocks which use words to tell the time in place of numbers are an increasingly popular hacker project, but we have to admit that before seeing this gorgeous clock from \[Mitch Feig\], [we didn’t realize how badly we wanted to see one that could curse like a sailor](http://angryelectrons.co/WordClock-1).

But don’t worry, the WordClock-1 knows more than just the bad words. Rather than using an array of illuminated letters as we’ve seen in previous clocks, this one uses six alphanumeric LED displays. So not only can it display the time expressed with words _and_ numbers, but it can show pretty much any other text you might have in mind.

\[Mitch\] is partial to having his clock toss a swear word on the display every few seconds, but perhaps you’d rather have it show some Klingon vocabulary to help you brush up. The lack of extended characters does limit its language capabilities somewhat, but it still manages to include Spanish, Italian, French, and Croatian libraries.

The ESP32 powered clock comes as a kit, and \[Mitch\] has provided some very thorough documentation that should make assembling it fairly straightforward as long as you don’t mind tackling a few SMD components. Additional word databases are stored on an SD card, and you can easily add your own or edit the existing ones with nothing more exotic than a text editor. The clock itself is configured via a web interface, and includes features like RGB LED effects and support for pulling the time down from an external GPS receiver.

Of course, if you’re content with what we can apparently now refer to as “old style” word clocks, [we’ve seen plenty of projects](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/27/leds-shine-through-pcb-on-this-tiny-word-clock/) which [should serve as inspiration](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/09/rgb-word-clock-doesnt-skimp-on-the-features/) for anyone looking to [roll their own textual timepiece](https://hackaday.com/2019/02/15/is-that-a-word-clock-in-your-pocket/).
