Young maker Hugh Murtagh shared this project at the [BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition](https://btyoungscientist.com).

Via [the Journal.ie](https://www.thejournal.ie/young-scientist-autism-students-wristband-4959147-Jan2020/):

> The wristband, that can be worn by the student with Autism, has a button on it. When a student is feeling overwhelmed they can press the button which then sends an alert to the teacher to make them aware of the situation.
> 
> This system allows for the student to make their teacher aware that they are feeling overwhelmed without drawing extra attention to themselves in the classroom.
