Sadly, we just decided to abandon the Cocoa update for our app. It's not easy to walk away from 3 years of work, but better 3 years lost than 5. Time will be better spent on our Windows version. TurtleSoft started Mac-only with Excel templates in 1987. The first prototype of our current stand-alone accounting app was in the early 90s. Since then, programming for Mac has gone through four primary programming languages (Pascal, C++, Objective C, Swift). Three, soon to be four chip architectures (680x0, PPC, Intel, ARM). Four frameworks (MacApp or Think Class Library, PowerPlant, Carbon, Cocoa). Microsoft and Adobe are big enough that they've survived the many pivots. They can just throw 100 programmers at it. Intuit has barely kept up. For anyone smaller, it's hard to justify the constant need to rewrite code just to stay in the same place. Return on investment is just not there. Seems like each new update is more difficult. Many good apps for Mac have died in one pivot or another. We managed to lurch through most of the changes, but not this one. Thinking ahead to the consequences of Marzipan was the last straw. Meanwhile, our Windows version hasn't needed any work since 2000. It probably will take less than a year to get it updated to 64-bit and a better interface.
