Ever since I took glass blowing courses at the Ohio State University in the early 2000â€™s â€“ Iâ€™ve had a fascination with the art form. This fine art venetian glass demo is so intricate and beautiful. My finished pieces were never as thin or symmetrical as this, however my mother loves all of the heavier, wobblier pieces I made for her ![ðŸ™‚](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png) Corning Museum of Glass shared this video on [Youtube!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ_QioopZLk)

> This goblet is made using filigrana, a style of blown glass made with colorless, white, and sometimes colored canes that originated on the island of Murano in the 16th century. The canemaking and glassblowing processes are shown in the video.
