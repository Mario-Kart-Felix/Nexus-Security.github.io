During [the Inside Xbox X019 livestream](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/x019-inside-xbox-livestream-news-everwild-grounded/1100-6471272/), the company announced three new games coming to Xbox One: [Planet Coaster](https://www.gamespot.com/planet-coaster/), Tell Me Why, and [The Artful Escape](https://www.gamespot.com/the-artful-escape/).

Planet Coaster is a roller coaster management simulation and builder, where you construct your own amusement parks to satisfy the many denizens of the game's world. Microsoft announced that the game is headed to Xbox One in Summer 2020.

Tell Me Why is [the newest game from Dontnod Entertainment](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/life-is-strange-dev-reveals-new-game-tell-me-why/1100-6471450/), the studio behind the [Life is Strange](https://www.gamespot.com/life-is-strange/) series. The game is another narrative-focused experience that follows twins in a small Alaskan town. Similar to Planet Coaster, Tell Me Why is aiming for a Summer 2020 release on Xbox One.

The Artful Escape is a colorful platformer from prolific indie game publisher Annapurna Interactive. The game is expected to launch on Apple Arcade, PC, and Xbox One sometime in 2020.

Microsoft confirmed that every game revealed launches day and date on Xbox Game Pass. The X019 livestream is still underway and the company has already divulged a bevy of information, including some release dates, new game announcements, closed and open beta opportunities, and more.
