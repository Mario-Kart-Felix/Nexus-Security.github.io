**Prosecco Pringles – ‘What is yours, it will never give you pain and what is not yours will always give you pain’**  
  
From Katfriend **[David Serras Pereira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidserraspereira/)** (SCM) comes the news that Prosecco Pringles have been seized in Italy. Why? Read on:  
  
We learned last week from **[The Guardian](https://amp-theguardian-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/16/stop-you-cant-pop-prosecco-pringles-seized-in-italy)** that 250 boxes of Pringles 'prosecco and pink peppercorn flavour' had been seized in Italy. Allegedly, such seizure was based on the unauthorised use of the “Prosecco” Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) which was granted on [**17/10/2019**](https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/food-safety-and-quality/certification/quality-labels/geographical-indications-register/pdf/ec_wine_90772.pdf) and includes a number of [**specifications**](https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/food-safety-and-quality/certification/quality-labels/geographical-indications-register/includes/showSpecification.cfm?attachmentId=21911) (good luck reading them). From Pringles's short statement we learned that, on the one hand, they would discontinue this special edition but, on the other hand, they think that they acted in accordance with European legislation and guidelines governing the subject.  
  
So, to understand this clash of titans, let’s take a quick look at the main issues that require consideration.  
  
First, the relevant legislation consists of [**Regulations 1308/2013**](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32013R1308&from=pt) (Recital 97 and Articles 93 and 103(2)) and [**1151/2012**](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32012R1151) (Recital 32 and Articles 4(b)-(c), 12 and 13). Consideration should be also taken of the [**EU Guidelines on the labelling of foodstuffs using protected designations of origin (PDOs) or protected geographical indications (PGIs) as ingredients**](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52010XC1216(01)&from=PT). From the latter it appears that:  
  

*   A name registered as a PDO or PGI may legitimately be included in the list of ingredients of a foodstuff
*   A name registered as a PDO or PGI may be mentioned in or close to the trade name of a foodstuff incorporating products benefiting from a registered name, as well as in the labelling, presentation and advertising relating to that foodstuff, provided that the certain conditions are met. 
*   On the assumption that the conditions referred to in the point above are satisfied, the terms, abbreviations or symbols accompanying the registered name should be used in labelling, within or close to the trade name or in the list of ingredients of the foodstuff only if it is made clear that the said foodstuff is not itself a PDO or PGI.
*   If an ingredient comparable to an ingredient benefiting from a PDO/PGI has been incorporated in a foodstuff, the name registered as a PDO/PGI should appear only in the list of ingredients.

In case C‑393/16 ([**here**](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=198044&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=5170971); the _Champagner Sorbet_ case) the Court of Justice of the European Union (like **[IPKat](http://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2017/12/cjeu-rules-that-ice-cream-sold-as.html)** so well said!) “The CJEU substantially followed the AG Opinion, stating that if it tastes like champagne – it is champagne.”  
  
As Pringles said, they would discontinue this limited edition, but could have they fought back based on existing CJEU case law? Could they claim that their product had – as an essential characteristic – a taste attributable primarily to the presence of Prosecco in its composition (Pringles said that “We used prosecco DOC as an ingredient in the aroma”), thus leading to the conclusion that their actions did not constituted a false or misleading indication within the meaning of the relevant provisions of the two aforementioned Regulations? Could they rely on the _Champagner Sorbet_ case? Possibly yes!
