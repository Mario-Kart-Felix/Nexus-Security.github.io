> This project aims at building an interactive TicTacToe model using two different colored LEDs denoting the two players using a raspberry pi. The idea here was to implement this on a bigger scale in an alleyway – imagine a grid of 3×3 semi-globes (like ones shown above) stuck on the wall where pressing one initiates the game (and a specific colored LED turns on). This can be implemented in alleyways beside bars, pubs or any place where people have to line up and wait – hence making the zone an interactive area where people actually enjoy while they wait.
