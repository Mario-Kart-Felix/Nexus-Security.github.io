TikTok and UN Women have joined hands for a campaign called #KaunsiBadiBaatHai to raise awareness for violence against women in India. This collaboration is part of the global 16 days of activism against gender violence “[Orange the World](https://www.unwomen.org/-/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/what%20we%20do/evaw/16-days-2019-concept-note-en.pdf)” that started earlier this week on November 25 which is observed as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.  

TikTok users willing to take part in the campaign are asked to submit a video by syncing lips to a rap soundtrack by Delhi-based 16-year old rapper Abbas Ali from Slam Out Loud.
