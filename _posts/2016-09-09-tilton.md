Tilton
======

In 2000, the programmatic browser differences were perplexing, so I made a tool to help manage the problem. I started with something similar to `ecomcon` (see [_How JavaScript Works_](https://www.howjavascriptworks.com), Chapter 23). I would have special markers in the source that designated sections of code that would only be delivered to particular browsers.

```
<~ns4~layer.visibility = "hide";~> <~ie5~layer.style.visibility = "hidden";~>
```

The convention of combining angle brackets with special characters was popularized by PHP. I chose `~`tilde because it is rarely used in HTML, JavaScript, or English.

I then thought to add variables.

```
<~set~year~2000~> <~get~year~>
```

If a variable could contain a sequence of digits, I should be able to add them.

```
<~set~next year~<~add~<~get~year~>~1~>~>
```

At this point I should have noticed that this language was going to be inexcusably ugly, but astonishingly, I did not notice at the time. I kept pushing on, inspired by better languages like TRAC and LISP. I determined that this was the wrong approach for dealing with browser incompatibility, but I completed the language anyway. I named it [Tilton](https://www.crockford.com/tilton/tilton.html) after [Robert Tilton](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=robert+tilton), a television faith healer and speaker of tongues. I believe that [Tilton](https://www.crockford.com/tilton/tilton.html) is the ugliest programming language that was not intended to be an ugly programming language.

I do not expect anyone to use [Tilton](https://www.crockford.com/tilton/tilton.html), but I use [Tilton](https://www.crockford.com/tilton/tilton.html) every day. The [`json.org`](https://www.json.org) site is managed with [Tilton](https://www.crockford.com/tilton/tilton.html). [So is this one.](https://www.crockford.com)
