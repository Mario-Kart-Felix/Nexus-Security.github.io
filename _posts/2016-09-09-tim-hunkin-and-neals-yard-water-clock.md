We’re digging this delightfully retro [video](https://youtu.be/FzapXeMrW3s) about the Neal’s Yard Water Clock via [MechMinestrone68](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu2jrLmhS6Q7WUbP3J_ieww) on YouTube.

Here’s a bit more about the clock via [London Walking Tours](https://www.london-walking-tours.co.uk/secret-london/neals-yard-water-clock.htm):

> The clock was created in 1982 by the aquatic horologists (that’s what it says on the plaque!) Tim Hunkin and Andy Plant. It originally adorned the front of Michael Loftus’s Neal’s Yard Wholefood Warehouse.
> 
> A Holland and Barrett Health Food shop now occupies the premises, but the clock is still there and has been delighting (as well as occasionally soaking) passersby below for over 30 years..
> 
> When the clock worked (it hasn’t been fully functional for a while now) it was a wonderful sight to behold.
