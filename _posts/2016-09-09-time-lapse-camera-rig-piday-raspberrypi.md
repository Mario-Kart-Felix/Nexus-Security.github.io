> My time-lapse rig uses a first gen’ Pi + a very cheap USB webcam + a free stand (bipod). Part of my build criteria is to reuse/up-cycle stuff I’ve already got, otherwise I’d have just gone out and bought a Pi camera module and used this project guide. Oh.. and it all had to be run via the terminal – as I envisaged that most/all of the post processing would be done remotely (headless), or not using a network.
