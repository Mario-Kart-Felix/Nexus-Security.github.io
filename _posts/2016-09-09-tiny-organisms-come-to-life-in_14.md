> The familiar faces of friendly puppets like Kermit and Elmo are missing from [Judith Hope](https://www.judithhope.co.uk/)’s enlarged microbe creations that magnify the world’s tiniest organisms. A brown [bacteriophage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage), commonly known as a virus, features six moveable legs powered by a hand-operated device, while a pink tardigrade stands upright and sways side-to-side. Sometimes referred to as a “water bear,” the [tardigrade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade) imitates a resilient animal who can survive in extreme conditions and is usually only .02 inches long when fully grown. The models originally were created for the [Tatwood Puppets](https://www.instagram.com/tatwoodpuppets/?hl=en) production of [Microbodyssey](https://www.tatwoodpuppets.co.uk/microbodyssey), a visual experience utilizing puppetry and shadow theater to explore life under the microscope. You can watch a trailer for the microbe-based show on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/332080576), and see more of Hope’s handheld crafts on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/judithhopepuppetmaker/).
