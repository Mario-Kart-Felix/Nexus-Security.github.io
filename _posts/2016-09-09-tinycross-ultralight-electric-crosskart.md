We first wrote about Shane Colton’s TinyCross ultralight electric crosskart back on [August 27, 2018](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/27/tinycross-an-ultralight-electric-crosskart/). Since that time [some upgrades](http://scolton.blogspot.com/2019/09/tinycross-first-test-drive-and.html) have been in the making.

I haven’t done any tuning on it besides setting the preload, but it handles my pretty beat up parking lot nicely, absorbing bumps that would have broken [tinyKart](http://scolton.blogspot.com/p/cap-kart.html#tinykart) in minutes.

And any good vehicle these days gathers data on performance:

Nothing ever works perfectly on the first try, but having data logging built in from the start is the best way I know of to quickly diagnose problems. A lot of the stuff that happens in a motor drive is faster than typical data logging can capture, but a lot of it is also periodic. By synchronizing the data collected to the rotor electrical angle, its possible to reveal detailed periodic signals even with relatively low frequency (50Hz) logging to an SD card.
