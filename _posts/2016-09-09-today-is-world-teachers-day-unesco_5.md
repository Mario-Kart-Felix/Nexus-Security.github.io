Today the world celebrates teachers with #WorldTeachersDay. Great teachers have the ability to alter and uplift the course of students lives and its awesome to have a day to say thanks!

For 2019 the focus is on newer teachers to help support the next generation of educators.

From [UNESCO](https://en.unesco.org/commemorations/worldteachersday):

> In 2019, World Teachers’ Day will celebrate teachers with the theme, “Young Teachers: The future of the Profession.” The day provides the occasion to celebrate the teaching profession worldwide, to take stock of achievements, and to address some of the issues central for attracting and keeping the brightest minds and young talents in the profession.

If you want to learn more about the theme and its importance you can read more [here](https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/wtd-2019-concept-note-en.pdf)

There will be a [special celebration](https://en.unesco.org/events/world-teachers-days-2019-celebration-unesco) event on Monday October 7th in Paris
