Interbrand released the list of “Best Global Brands 2019” earlier this week and tech companies have topped the list. With no further delay, let’s take a look at the companies that made it to the top 10 positions.  

The company that managed to secure the first position in the list is none other than the [trillion-dollar behemoth of a company](https://beebom.com/apple-trillion-dollar-company-factsheet/), **Apple**, with a brand value of $234.24 billion. The Cupertino giant is followed by software giant **Google** whose brand value stands at $167.71 billion.  

**Amazon** comes third with a $125.26 billion brand value, while **Microsoft**, with 108.85 billion brand value managed to secure the fourth position. In the fifth position, we have a non-tech company – **Coca Cola**($63.36 billion) followed by **Samsung** in the sixth position with a $61.1 billion brand value.  

**Toyota** came seventh followed by **Mercedes-Benz** and **McDonald’s** on 8th and 9th positions with brand values $56.24 billion, $50.83 billion, and $45.36 billion respectively. To wrap up the list, we have **Disney,** with a brand value of $44.35 billion.  

It is worth noting that Facebook fell to 14th position from its 9th position the social media giant secured on 2018’s list. The report also mentions that the **luxury and retail industry is still the fastest growing sector** on the planet.  

_“The age of brand positioning is over. In a world where customer expectations will continue to move faster than businesses, static brand positions and incremental change will just about keep brands in the game – but it will take, brave, we would say ‘iconic’, moves, to make brands leap ahead of customer expectations and ultimately deliver extraordinary business results.”,_ says Charles Trevail, Global Chief Executive Officer of Interbrand.
