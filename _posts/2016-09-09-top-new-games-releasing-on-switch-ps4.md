New Releases breaks down the hottest games launching each week, and this episode is all over the globe. It starts in the east, where [Shenmue 3](https://www.gamespot.com/shenmue-iii/) continues Ryo Hazuki's story in China and [Sniper: Ghost Warrior Contracts](https://www.gamespot.com/sniper-ghost-warrior-contracts/) drops you into Siberia. Meanwhile, [Civilization 6](https://www.gamespot.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/) is coming to PS4 and Xbox One, letting you conquer the rest of the world. There are also some fantasy and sci-fi adventures to be had, thanks to [Munchkin: Quacked Quest](https://www.gamespot.com/munchkin-quacked-quest/) and [Black Future '88](https://www.gamespot.com/black-future-88/).

Shenmue 3 isn't the end of Ryo Hazuki's story, but fans of the [Sega Dreamcast](https://www.gamespot.com/dreamcast/) classic have been waiting a long time for the next chapter nonetheless. The third game picks up in a small fishing village in China, where Ryo continues to track down his father's killer. Expect the usual dose of mini-games and intriguing characters as you explore the open world.

Munchkin: Quacked Quest -- November 19
--------------------------------------

_Available on: PC, Switch_

[![No Caption Provided](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1563/15636435/3604954-1450251171-Munch.jpg)](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1563/15636435/3604954-1450251171-Munch.jpg)

Quacked Quest is based on the Munchkin card game, which is not just about fighting monsters and scoring loot--backstabbing your friends is just as important. This procedurally generated dungeon-crawler operates the same way. You can fight your way through castles and caverns in co-op, but there are lots of opportunities to turn on the party and steal all the gold for yourself.

Black Future '88 -- November 21
-------------------------------

_Available on: PC, Switch_

[![No Caption Provided](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1563/15636435/3604961-5839236502-rsz_b.jpg)](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1563/15636435/3604961-5839236502-rsz_b.jpg)

Munchkin isn't the only procedurally generated adventure dropping this week. Black Future '88 is set in a tower, and the layout changes each time you take another run to the top. Along the way, you'll dodge lasers and fight bosses until you reach the architect on the highest floor. You can make a vertical run in local co-op too.

The latest in the [Sniper: Ghost Warrior](https://www.gamespot.com/sniper-ghost-warrior/) series drops you in Siberia, where you'll have to take out targets in the concrete cities, snowy mountains, and deep forests. You can carry out your missions in a variety of ways, and the new AR mask opens up even more possibilities. You can use it to scan the environment, identifying weak points and objects of interest.
