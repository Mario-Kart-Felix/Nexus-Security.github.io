The biggest Apple news of this week was obviously the launch of the new 16-inch MacBook Pro, which debuted on Wednesday with a new "Magic Keyboard" and some other nice upgrades.  
  
  
  
  
  
Other popular topics this week included confirmation from Apple that the new Mac Pro will ship in December, rumors about Apple's AR headset/glasses project, a launch of the Research app that Apple previewed back in September, and some of our favorite tips and tricks for the new AirPods Pro.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
  
  
It's finally here. After months of seemingly endless rumors, [Apple has finally introduced the 16-inch MacBook Pro](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/13/16-inch-macbook-pro-announced-with-up-to-64gb-of-ram-and-8tb-ssd-new-keyboard-louder-speakers-and-more/).

New features include a larger 16-inch display with slimmer bezels, a so-called Magic Keyboard with a redesigned scissor mechanism, a physical Esc key, up to 8-core 9th-generation Intel Core processors, up to 8TB of SSD storage and 64GB RAM, and AMD Radeon Pro 5000M series graphics.  
  
  
  
  
  
[First impressions of the notebook have praised the new keyboard](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/13/16-inch-macbook-pro-first-impressions/), which should hopefully prove to be more reliable than the issue-prone butterfly keyboards on recent MacBook Pro models. We have an [early hands-on video](https://t.co/FeYGXJ58D6) with the new MacBook Pro and will have more extensive coverage next week.  
  
  
  
  
  
The new 16-inch MacBook Pro is [available to order on Apple.com](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch) and in the Apple Store app, with pricing starting at the same $2,399 as the previous 15-inch MacBook Pro, which has been discontinued. In-store availability and customer deliveries [have begun](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/15/16-inch-macbook-pro-apple-store-pickup/), and some third-party retailers are [already offering discounts](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/15/deals-16-inch-macbook-100-discount/) from Apple's pricing.

Trio of Friends Make Challenging Hike Across Catalina Island to Recreate the macOS Catalina Wallpaper
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
  
  
A few months ago, photographer Andrew Levitt teamed up with his friends Jacob Phillips and Taylor Gray on a one-week road trip to try to recreate all of Apple's default wallpapers included in macOS.  
  
  
  
  
  
![](https://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/11/catalina_island_photos-800x450.jpg)  
  
  
Just a few weeks after the video, Apple publicly released macOS Catalina, giving Levitt and his friends one more wallpaper to recreate. The task was more challenging this time, however, as the default ‌macOS Catalina‌ wallpaper showcases the remote, northern tip of Santa Catalina Island off the coast of Southern California.  
  
  
  
  
  
To accomplish the feat, [Levitt and his friends embarked on a challenging hike across Catalina Island](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/14/recreating-macos-catalina-wallpaper-video/), making for quite a fascinating video.
