Most wireheads are likely familiar with the world-famous electronics marketplaces of Huaqiangbei in Shenzhen, China. But did you know there is a similar marketplace in Shenzhen dedicated to the hardware, materials, and supplies used in manufacturing?

In the latest [Strange Parts](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO8DQrSp5yEP937qNqTooOw) video, Scotty and two of his maker pals spend a day touring the Yihua and Depu industrial markets of Shenzhen. Here you can buy CNC screw machines, Kapton tape dispensers, conveyor belt parts, pick and place pneumatics, industrial wire strippers, solder ingots, and lots of factory floor warning stickers.

Scottâ€™s friend Kenneth ends up buying a set of [Andon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andon_(manufacturing)) stack lights (used for indicating that a machine on a factory line needs attention) for around US$5. One of these units would cost hundreds in the US.
