Lightning strikes are quite high energy events, and release plenty of radio frequency energy when they go off in the atmosphere. This makes them easy to detect, and the magnitude of the energy release means it can be done at impressive range. [\[Jay\] decided to build a device of his very own, and was impressed at its detection performance.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VacGFyoY2vI&feature=youtu.be)

[The device is a simple but effective design](http://easycircuit012.blogspot.com/2012/12/lightning-detector-circuit-diagram.html). An antenna is used to capture RF signals, and these are then amplified through a single transistor stage. This is connected to a basic transistor flasher circuit, which is biased to only flash when tipped over the edge by an incoming signal. After building the circuit, \[Jay\] noticed that the device wasn’t just picking up signals from lightning, but also those from many other smaller discharges. The device was able to detect a shock from wearing socks on a wood floor, as well as discharges from a Van de Graff generator and even just from getting out of a chair!

Lightning detectors have been around for a long time now; [we’ve seen others grace these pages before](https://hackaday.com/2018/03/22/an-introduction-to-storm-detector-modules/). Video after the break.
