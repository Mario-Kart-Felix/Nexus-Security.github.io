###   

*   Automated Vulnerability Scanner for XSS 
*   Written in Python3 

  
Traxss is an automated framework to scan URLs and webpages for XSS Vulnerabilities. It includes over 575 Payloads to test with and multiple options for robustness of tests.  

### Getting Started

**Prerequisites**  
Traxss depends on Chromedriver. On MacOS this can be installed with the homebrew command:  
  
brew install cask chromedriver  
  
Alternatively, find a version for other operating systems here: https://ift.tt/1Ebv3hW  
  

### Installation

**Run the command:**  
  
pip3 install -r requirements.txt  
  
**Running Traxss**  
Traxx can be started with the command:  
  
python3 traxss.py  
  
This will launch an interactive CLI to guide you through the process.  
  

### Types of Scans

Full Scan with HTML  
  
Uses a query scan with 575+ payloads and attempts to find XSS vulnerabilities by passing parameters through the URL. It will also render the HTML and attempt to find manual XSS Vulnerablities (this feature is still in beta).  
  

### Full Scan w/o HTML

This scan will run the query scan only.  
  

### Fast Scan w/o HTML

This scan is the same as the full w/ HTML but it will only use 7 attack vectors rather than the 575+ vectors.
