Posted on the [Code and Life Blog](https://codeandlife.com/2016/01/07/adafruit-trinket-usb-keyboard-without-arduino/):

> Just a quick update this time: A long while ago I made a post about [using Adafruit Trinket without Arduino](https://codeandlife.com/2016/01/07/adafruit-trinket-usb-keyboard-without-arduino/) and later converted that into a TrinketMIDI Github repository for making a MIDI device with ATtiny:

TrinketMIDI is a V-USB MIDI implementation for [Adafruit Trinket](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1501). It also supports [Adafruit Pro Trinket](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2000).

The code is in [GitHub](https://github.com/jokkebk/TrinketMIDI) and is under a GPL license.

The new volume demo program is [here](https://github.com/jokkebk/TrinketMIDI/blob/master/demo_midivolume.c) and an explanation is below.
