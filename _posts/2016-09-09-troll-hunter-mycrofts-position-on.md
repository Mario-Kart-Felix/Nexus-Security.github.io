[Troll Hunter – Mycroft’s Position on Patent Trolls – Mycroft](https://mycroft.ai/blog/troll-hunter-mycrofts-position-on-patent-trolls/) –

> Mycroft’s First Patent Troll
> 
> …Tumey LLP based out of Texas ( a venue famous for hosting patent trolls ) contacted us with a “Highly Confidential” letter offering to license his “client’s” “valuable” voice patents to Mycroft AI Inc.  When we didn’t respond ( don’t feed the trolls! ) he filed suit in East Texas.
> 
> As a result, we’ve taken the time to develop an internal policy about how we’re going to deal with patent trolls.  Here is how we’re going to handle them:
> 
> “We are going to litigate every single patent suit to the fullest extent possible including appealing any adverse decisions all the way to the Supreme Court.”
> 
> Our policy is also to attack bogus patents like [U.S. Patent No. 9,794,348](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9794348B2/en) and have them re-examined and invalidated where possible.  We’ll be doing this in the context of a strong open source community that includes other troll hunters like the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Open Innovation Network – both of whom have a strong interest in protecting open technology from rent-seeking trolls.
> 
> Patent trolls get paid because short-sighted companies make the decision to pay.  Simply put, it is usually cheaper in the short run to pay a troll than it is to litigate.  It is also cheaper to give a schoolyard bully your lunch money than it is to visit a doctor.  The thing is, once you pay the bully, he’ll just come back again and again and again. Eventually, that lunch money adds up to a lot more than a doctor’s visit.  In the long run the best way to deal with a bully is to punch him square in the face. You might take a beating, but if you do it every time? The bully will find easier prey.
