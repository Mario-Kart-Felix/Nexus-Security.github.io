Before RadioShack decided the best business model for an electronics store was to harass its customers into buying overpriced batteries and cellphones, it was a great one-stop shop for most discrete components, knobs, resistors, radio equipment, and even a popular computer. That computer, the TRS-80, is a popular one in the retrocomputing world and if you can’t get original parts to restore one, [you can always build your own clone](http://www.glensstuff.com/trs80/trs80.htm).

This build comes to us from \[Glen\] aka \[glenk\] who is known for retrocomputing builds like [this classic PET we featured a little over a year ago](https://hackaday.com/2018/12/06/a-scratch-built-forgotten-classic-of-the-early-pc-age/), and this TRS-80 is his latest project. He really gets into the weeds on the hardware, too. This isn’t an FPGA or Raspberry Pi running a TRS-80 on lookalike hardware. \[Glen\] has completely redesigned the computer from the ground up using modern CMOS components in order to make a modern, perfectly functional replica of the RadioShack classic.

Because of the level of detail \[Glen\] goes into, this one is a must-read for anyone interested in computing hardware (as opposed to the software, which you could learn about through a more simple emulator) and retrocomputing in general, and also brings most of us back to a more nostalgic, simpler time where a trip to [RadioShack](https://hackaday.com/2018/07/23/the-return-of-radioshack/) was fun and interesting.
