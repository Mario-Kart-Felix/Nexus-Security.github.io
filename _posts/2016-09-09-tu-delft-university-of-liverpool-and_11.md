Welcome to drone day on the Adafruit blog. Every Monday we deliver the latest news, products and more from the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), quadcopter and drone communities. Drones can be [used](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle) for video & photography (dronies), civil applications, policing, farming, firefighting, military and non-military security work, such as surveillance of pipelines. Previous posts can be found via the #drone tag and our [drone](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/drones/) / [UAV categories](https://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/uavs/).
