> This thread clamp is fully 3d printable with no supports, glue, or cleanup.
> 
> Check out the videos for assembly instructions and a clamping demo.
> 
> All parts of this clamp can be printed with standard settings, but if you want it stronger, print the knob.stl at 100% infill. Also make sure to apply wax to the threads for smoother turning.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And donâ€™t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
