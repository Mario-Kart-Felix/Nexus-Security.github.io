Twitter is back at its annual blast from the past with #ThisHappened in 2019 where the company features the tweets and hashtags that managed to create a buzz on the microblogging platform across various interests. This year, we have got some interesting tweets so let’s get started with it.  

Firstly, we have the memorable ISRO’s [Chandrayaan-2](https://beebom.com/indias-chandrayaan-2-lunar-mission-lifts-off-successfully/) mission. While everyone had a heartbreaking moment when the [Vikram Lander](https://beebom.com/chandrayaan-2-mission-believed-to-have-ended-in-failure-as-lunar-lander-vikram-goes-missing/) went missing, we got emotional support and applause for the mission from Twitteratis worldwide, including renown space agency  NASA.

We commend [@ISRO](https://twitter.com/isro?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)’s attempt to land their [#Chandrayaan2](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Chandrayaan2?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) mission on the Moon’s South Pole. You have inspired us with your journey and look forward to future opportunities to explore our solar system together. [https://t.co/pKzzo9FDLL](https://t.co/pKzzo9FDLL)
