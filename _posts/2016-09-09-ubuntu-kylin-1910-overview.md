Ubuntu Kylin is an official Ubuntu subproject whose goal is to create a variant of Ubuntu that is more suitable for Chinese users using the Simplified Chinese writing system. The project provides a delicate, thoughtful and fully customised Chinese user experience out-of-the-box by providing a desktop user interface localised into Simplified Chinese and with software generally preferred by many Chinese users. Ubuntu Kylin was originally shipping with Ubuntu's Unity desktop, but starting with version 17.04, it was replaced with a custom desktop called UKUI (based on MATE).
