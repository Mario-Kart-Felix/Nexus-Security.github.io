I am ancient enough to remember 8-track tape technology. Some of my introductions to bands like King Crimson and Cream were through a mono ear bud plugged into a portal 8-track player from Sears.

But even though I was always inquisitive about technology and how things worked, I never knew how an 8-track cartridge actually functioned until this video.

Besides Mat taking apart a cart and figuring out how it works, he also unboxes a “new” Pioneer HR-99 8-track Recorder from 1975 that he bought on eBay.
