The Uncharted movie continues to take shape. Following the news that Bumblebee director [Travis Knight](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tom-hollands-uncharted-movie-gets-a-new-director/1100-6470155/) will helm the film, it's been reported that Mark Wahlberg is set to join Tom Holland in the cast.

According to [Variety](https://variety.com/2019/film/news/mark-wahlberg-tom-holland-uncharted-movie-sony-1203394336/), Wahlberg is in "final talks" to play Victor "Sully" Sullivan in the adaptation of the hit video game. Sullivan is described as an American treasure hunter, fortune seeker, and businessman, as well as a friend to main character Nathan Drake, the role Holland is playing. Sullivan is a recurring character in the video game series.

This isn't the first time Wahlberg has been attached to a movie version of Uncharted. Back in 2007, the star was set to play the role of Drake, with David O. Russell (American Hustle, The Fighter) writing and directing. However, Russell left the project in 2011, and the film has been stuck in development ever since.

Knight was announced as director in September, replacing Dan Trachtenberg. Knight scored a big hit last year with Bumblebee, his first live-action film, and he was Oscar-nominated for the acclaimed animated movie Kubo and the Two Strings. Uncharted is currently [slated for a December 18, 2020](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-uncharted-movie-starring-tom-holland-finally-h/1100-6467453/) release.
