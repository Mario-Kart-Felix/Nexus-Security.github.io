> This Unicorn Horn is perfect for your next Unicorn Party!  
> This is a remix from the Adafruit Unicorn Horn, with a bigger customizable horn and without all the Adafruit stuffs (using a small bike light).  
> I designed this so that there is room for a bike light inside of it, but that is optionnal.  
> The threaded base allows you to access the light by unscrewing the horn. It is curved so that it fit perfectly your hat radius!
> 
> I recommend you to sew the base on a hat, small holes in the base make it easy.
> 
> Is included a 250mm printable version, great for ender3, and a 200mm version for smaller printer.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And donâ€™t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
