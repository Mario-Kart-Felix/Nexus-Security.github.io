> A proper compass!
> 
> 70-80% rectilinear infill, PLA, 0.15 mm layer height  
> need 30mm m5 or 1.25″ #10 flat-head machine screw. File two flats on the head so it measures 7mm flat-to-flat. Screw it together with washer and thumb nut.
> 
> Point can be 2mm-5.5mm diameter. A sharpened nail works nice.
> 
> File or sand the wedge so it’s smooth. Trim it to length if you like.
> 
> The pivot is much smoother to adjust if you file the sharp edges (where it sticks to print bed) and scribble some graphite/soft pencil onto the touching conical surfaces.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
