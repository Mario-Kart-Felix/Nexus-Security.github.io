University of Helsinky and MIT are developing smart technology for remote monitoring of babies. Via [wearable technology](https://www.wearable-technologies.com/2020/02/university-of-helsinki-and-mit-researchers-develop-movement-suit-smart-diaper-for-remote-monitoring-of-babies/)

> Previously, it wasn’t possible to quantitatively track children’s spontaneous motility in their natural environment. Instead, children have been primarily qualitatively assessed at the physician’s or physiotherapist’s practice, which requires taking into account the fact that the infant’s behavior in the practice setting does not necessarily entirely match that seen at home, reports Miia Soininen in University of Helsinki News.

> “The smart jumpsuit provides us with the first opportunity to quantify infants’ spontaneous and voluntary movements outside the laboratory. The child can be sent back home with the suit for the rest of the day. The next day, it will be returned to the hospital where the results will then be processed,” explains Sampsa Vanhatalo, professor of clinical neurophysiology at the University of Helsinki.
