One of the globe's largest cryptocurrency transactions is being forced to cease account debits and credits when it was hit by a huge online theft worth $52M. UpBit, a South Korean cryptocurrency market, announced the provisional stay declaration on Wednesday accompanied by a letter from CEO Lee Seok-woo, Dunamu. "The heist took place on Wednesday in the afternoon. Around $50 million in Ethereum currency were sent from an UpBit account via an anonymous beneficiary," says Lee Seok-woo.

The victims of the robbery will have their damages satisfied by the firm, which has sent additional crypto-currencies into the firm's cool account for advanced safety. “It is expected that our company will take around 2 weeks more until the transaction gets active again. As soon as it is done, we'll inform the public,” stated Lee. UpBit’s toils are the newest in a lengthy series of victorious cyberattacks attacking cryptocurrencies markets in recent times. Other victims involve United States company Coinbase, which faced charges whopping $1million, Bitpoint, of Japan, that suffered $32million, Singapore firm Bitrue, that was stripped of $4.5million and Binance, whose headquarters are in Malta.  
  
"The newest heist is a serious lesson to account holders concerning the value of working only on safe and secure exchanging forums," argues Peter Wood, CEO CoinBurp, a cryptocurrency exchange. He further continues, "it is especially critical in the case of cryptocurrency because it can't be traced virtually and, no regulatory authority is present to look over this problem." “But, possible account holders are ensured that they shouldn't be concerned as attacks like these have happened before. However, the individuals must examine the safety contracts and measures carefully while working on any cryptocurrency exchanging program,” says Lee Seok-woo.  
  
At the beginning of this year, the United Nations accused North Korea of utilizing its increasing hacking abilities to attack crypto markets in an attempt to fulfill the country's treasures. North Korea is accused of storing $2 Billion from the cryptocurrency hacks. Upbit was originally started as a business among Bittrex and Dunamu, a South Korean app maker, that supports messenger colossal Kakao. Other cryptocurrency exchanges have warned their users about the heist.
