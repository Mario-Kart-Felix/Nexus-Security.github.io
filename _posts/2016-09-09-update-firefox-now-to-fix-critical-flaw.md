You need to update your Firefox right now. This is to patch a zero-day vulnerability that could allow hackers to access your computer. So, if you’re a Firefox user, please update Firefox to the latest available version in order to safeguard your system.

Why Do I Need to Update Firefox?
--------------------------------

Just two days after releasing Firefox 72, which introduced the option to [delete your telemetry data](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/firefox-delete-personal-data/), Mozilla released Firefox v72.0.1. This updated version fixes a critical security flaw which Mozilla admits is already being abused in the wild.

[Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2020-03/#CVE-2019-17026) describes the issue as an “IonMonkey type confusion with StoreElementHole and FallibleStoreElement.” It goes on to say that “Incorrect alias information in IonMonkey JIT compiler for setting array elements could lead to a type confusion.”

The United States Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) further [claims](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/current-activity/2020/01/08/mozilla-patches-critical-vulnerability) that “An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to take control of an affected system.” Therefore, it’s crucial that you update Firefox.

How to Update Firefox to the Latest Version
-------------------------------------------

If you have the correct settings enabled, there’s a good chance Firefox will have updated itself already. However, to make absolutely sure, you need to check the version you’re currently running on your computer, and, if necessary, update Firefox manually.

To update Firefox, do the following:

1.  Click the hamburger menu in the Firefox menu bar.
2.  Click **Help > About Firefox** (or **Firefox > About Firefox** on a Mac).
3.  You’ll see your current version of Firefox, and any available updates.
4.  If there’s an update, click “Restart to update Firefox” to apply it.

At the end of the process, you should have 72.0.1 (or later) installed. And that patches this particular zero-day vulnerability. While zero-day vulnerabilities are scary, at least Mozilla acted quickly to limit the potential damage of this one.

How to Protect Yourself from Zero-Day Exploits
----------------------------------------------

Zero-day vulnerabilities and critical flaws are an unfortunate reality in this day and age. However, there are things you can do to help safeguard your security. So, here are several [ways to protect yourself from zero-day exploits](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-ways-protect-zero-day-exploit/).
