> Fry’s Electronics stores look like they’re heading for liquidation, but the retailer, which operates eight stores in Texas, says its stores will be restocked.  
> “We are not liquidating, or planning to close any stores,” said Manuel Valerio, spokesman for San Jose, Calif.-based Fry’s.
> 
> There’s one exception — its Palo Alto store, which lost its lease, he said — but the other 34 stores in nine states will have product again “over the next several weeks.”
> 
> Fry’s, which has been in business since 1985, **is in the process of converting most of its suppliers to a consignment model, which means Fry’s won’t own the merchandise.**
