The [12mm LED Pixels](https://learn.adafruit.com/12mm-led-pixels) guide has been updated and includes setup instructions for usage through User Python code on the Raspberry Pi using Blinka as well as use with CircuitPython.

> RGB Pixels are digitally-controllable lights you can set to any color, or animate. Each pixel contains an RGB LED and a controller chip molded into a ‘dot’ of silicone, with flanges so they can be pushed into holes in thin sheet material. The dots are waterproof and rugged — they’re typically used to make outdoor signs.
> 
> The display is 3V powered and 3V logic, so we placed it on a fully assembled & tested breakout board with a 3V regulator and level shifting circuitry. The display slots into a ZIF socket on board and we use a piece of double-sided tape to adhere it onto one side. There are four mounting holes so you can easily attach it to a box.
> 
> Both types use an 8mm diffused RGB LED (“12mm” refers to the size of the mounting hole for installation) — diffused pixels mix colors nicer. At **5 volts**, they draw a maximum of **60 milliamps** per pixel: 20 mA each for red, green and blue.
