The [Nokia 5110/3310 Monochrome LCD](https://learn.adafruit.com/nokia-5110-3310-monochrome-lcd) guide has been updated to include setup instructions for usage through User Python code on the Raspberry Pi using Blinka as well as use with CircuitPython.

> This is a quick tutorial for our 84×48 pixel monochrome LCD display. These displays are small, only about 1.5″ diameter, but very readable due and comes with a backlight. This display is made of 84×48 individual pixels, so you can use it for graphics, text or bitmaps. These displays are inexpensive, easy to use, require only a few digital I/O pins and are fairly low power as well.
> 
> To drive the display, you will need 3 to 5 digital output pins (depending on whether you want to manually control the chip select and reset lines). Another pin can be used to control (via on/off or PWM) the backlight.
