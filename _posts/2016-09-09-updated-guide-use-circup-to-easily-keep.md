Updated Guide: [Use CircUp to easily keep your CircuitPython libraries up to date](https://learn.adafruit.com/keep-your-circuitpython-libraries-on-devices-up-to-date-with-circup)

This guide has been updated with the latest features such as the ability to work with both PY and MPY file, the ability to show all available libraries, the ability to install libraries through the command line, and an automatic updater that will update all of your libraries.

> Do you have one or more devices running CircuitPython and you find all the frequent library updates by the hard-working Adafruit folks and community members hard to keep up with? Well then CircUp may just be the tool for you.
> 
> CircUp is a utility written by [Nicholas Tollervey](https://github.com/ntoll) that looks at all the libraries inside of the `lib` folder on your connected CircuitPython device. It can tell you what version each of them is, if there are any out of date libraries, and if they are out of date, it can automatically go to the repo, download and update the library for you. It’s still in the early stages of development, but already works quite well.
