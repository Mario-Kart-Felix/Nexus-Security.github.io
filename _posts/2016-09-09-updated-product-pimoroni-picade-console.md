Picade Console is fight stick-style arcade console that riffs off the [Pimoroni Picade](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2706) with the same retro feel, same joystick and buttons, dedicated power button, and driven by the same powerful combo of the Raspberry Pi and Picade X HAT. It’s beautifully packaged, comes with stickers and a neon-infused A3 Picade Console poster, and full assembly instructions.

The Picade Console Controller comes in kit form for you to build at home. All parts, panels, and components are included – you just need to supply the Raspberry Pi, power supply, SD card and HDMI cable! You’ll need latest [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4296) as the extra processing power gives great performance in many emulators – any memory amount will work, even the 1G version.
