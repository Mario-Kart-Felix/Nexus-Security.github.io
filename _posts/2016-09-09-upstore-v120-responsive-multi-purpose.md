Twitter is considering a feature that would allow users to tip one another – in [Bitcoins](https://beebom.com/hcakers-tor-browser-bitcoin-stealing/) though. _The Information_ reports that the micro-blogging platform is working on implementing a new payment feature to let people send money to each other. It is not yet clear whether the [Twitter](https://beebom.com/twitter-blocking-animated-pngs/) tipping feature would integrate with Jack Dorsey’s other company, Square, which is a financial services, merchant services aggregator, and mobile payment company based in San Francisco.  

Dorsey has made absolutely no secret of his love of Bitcoin over the years. [NewsBTC has reported](https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/06/14/jack-dorsey-believes-the-internet-will-soon-have-one-currency-but-will-it-be-bitcoin/) on the Twitter CEO opining that [Bitcoin will one day be the currency of the internet](https://beebom.com/bitcoin-only-currency-10-years-jack-dorsey/) and his company Square integrating cryptocurrency payments. _“Dorsey has been a major investor in the Bitcoin micropayments solution Lightning Network”_, said the report.  

Dorsey will move to Africa for three-six months this year to _“define the future”_. _“Sad to be leaving the continent for now. Africa will define the future (especially the bitcoin one!). Not sure where yet, but I’ll be living here for 3-6 months mid-2020. Grateful I was able to experience a small part”_, said the Twitter CEO. Dorsey has also hired Bitcoin developers for his payments company. He is an advocate of digital currency bitcoin but he also says it is _“not functional as a currency”_.
