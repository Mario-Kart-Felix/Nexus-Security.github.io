> The urban architecture of Sofia, Bulgaria becomes an oversized Tetris game in a series by [Mariyan Atanasov](https://www.behance.net/stastny). To create the visual allusion, Atanasov abstracted the Eastern European city’s geometric buildings into minimal images, editing out distractions like phone wires and trees. In each photo sections of architecture seem to float down, ready to slot into the stack in the same mode as the [classic 80’s video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) created by Soviet Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov. Atanasov is based in Paris, Texas and shares his photography and design projects on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/stastny) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mariyanatanasov/), including many other minimalist architectural studies from around Europe.
