Interesting piece from [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/usb-c-surface-pro-kindle-ps5-iphone-standard/) on the rocky rise of USB-C:

> The reason for USB-C’s ascent is simple: It’s just better. It can charge both ways, letting you use a laptop to power your smartphone, for instance. It can also charge fast, pumping 18W to your device to get you from empty [to 80 percent full](https://thewirecutter.com/blog/why-you-should-switch-to-usb-c-fast-charging-now/) in only an hour. It can transfer data at blistering speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second—and eventually much faster, as [Intel’s Thunderbolt protocol converges with USB4](https://www.wired.com/story/thunderbolt-3-usb4-twice-as-fast/). It can power video to external displays. And it’s reversible, meaning it works whichever way you plug it in.

> The situation has improved over time, but it’s still something of a tangle. To know exactly what you’re getting, you’re best off sticking with the USB-C cable that comes in the box. If you need a replacement, either get it straight from the same manufacturer, or something with clear labeling from a reputable vendor like Amazon or Monoprice.
