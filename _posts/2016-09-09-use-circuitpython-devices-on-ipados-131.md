Good news! The newly released [iPadOS 13.1](https://www.apple.com/ipados/) works with CircuitPython USB devices just as well as iOS 13. This means you can copy/edit and run code on a [Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333) directly from an iPad using the [same steps outlined for iPhone here](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/09/19/program-circuitpython-devices-with-iphone-ios-13/).

This has been tested to work with the latest stable release of [CircuitPython (v4.1.0)](https://circuitpython.org/board/circuitplayground_express/) on [Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333). Users running CircuitPython 5.0.0-alpha.4 will be unable to replace files on the CIRUITPY drive from iPad and should instead paste/rename code.py â€“ or simply [load CircuitPython v4.1.0](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuit-playground-express-circuitpython-5-minute-guide/update-circuitpython). Keep an eye out for our forthcoming Learn Guide with all the details.
