### Introduction

The `noexcept` specifier was introduced in C++ standard 11. Its explanation is also very straightforward. It specifies whether a function could throw exceptions.

  

I actually did not quite understand why we would like to prevent a program from throwing exceptions. In this blog, I am going to describe how `noexcept` could be used to protect C++ programs from undesired behaviors.

### Example

It turns out that some functions, especially some black box functions from libraries, would cause memory leak when an exception is thrown. The `getArraySum` function, which is an weird orchestrated function, in the following code is a such example.

  

To prevent the undesired memory leak from happening, instead of using the `getArraySumWarraper` function, we would like to use the `getArraySumWarraperNoexcept` function with the `noexcept` specifier. When `getArraySumWarraper` is called, the program would never crash, but potentially have risk of memory leak. When we call `getArraySumWarraperNoexcept`, the program crashes whenever there is an exception thrown from `getArraySum`.

```
#include #include  int getArraySum(size_t n) { int sum = 0; int* array = new int[n]; for (int i = 0; i < n; i ++) { array[i] = i; } // Weird exception criteria // Throwing this exception would cause memory leak if (n > 10) { throw std::runtime_error{"Weird exception!"}; } for (int i = 0; i < n; i ++) { sum += array[i]; } delete array; return sum; } int getArraySumWarraper(size_t n) { return getArraySum(n); } int getArraySumWarraperNoexcept(size_t n) noexcept { return getArraySum(n); } int main(int argc, char **argv) { const int iterations = 3; size_t size; int sum; int (*fcnPtr)(size_t); if (argc == 2 && strcmp(argv[1], "--noexcept") == 0) { std::cout << "Use noexcept specifier." << std::endl; fcnPtr = getArraySumWarraperNoexcept; } else { std::cout << "Do not use noexcept specifier." << std::endl; fcnPtr = getArraySumWarraper; } std::cout << "--------------------------------------" << std::endl; for (int i = 0; i < iterations; i ++) { std::cout << "Iteration #" << i << std::endl; std::cout << "Please input array size: " << std::endl; std::cin >> size; try { sum = (*fcnPtr)(size); } catch(const std::exception& e) { std::cerr << e.what() << std::endl; } } } 
```

To compile the program, run the following command in the terminal.

```
$ g++ noexcept.cpp -o noexcept 
```

We use [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) to check whether the program has memory leak or not.

  

If we input three numbers 1, 2, and 3, we donâ€™t have memory leak for the program with or without using the `noexcept` specifier.

If we input three numbers 100, 200, and 300, we are supposed to have memory leaks for the programs. As we can tell from the Valgrind results, without using the `noexcept` specifier, there is memory leak as expected. However, with using the `noexcept` specifier, the program would just crash.

```

### Conclusions

The `noexcept` specifier protects C++ program from memory leaks and potentially other undesired behaviors brought by throwing exceptions. For key functions we hardly know how to handle its exceptions, it might be a good idea to add the `noexcept` specifier.
