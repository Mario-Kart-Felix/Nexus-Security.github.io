\[David\] sends in his very nicely designed “Thumpware Media Controller” that lets your mobile phone headphones [control the media playback on your PC](https://hackaday.io/project/164185-thumpware-media-controller).

We realize that some PCs have support for the extra pins on cellphone earbuds, but at least some of us have experienced the frustration (however small) of habitually reaching up to touch the media controls on our earbuds only to hear the forlorn click of an inactive-button. This solves that, assuming you’re [still holding on to those 3.5mm headphones](https://hackaday.com/2016/10/25/death-to-the-3-5mm-audio-jack-long-live-wireless/), at least.

The media controls are intercepted by a PIC16 and a small board splits and interprets the signals into a male 3.5mm and a USB port. What really impressed us is the professional-looking design and enclosure. A lot of care was taken to plan out the wiring, assembly, and strain relief. Overall it’s a pleasure to look at.

All the files are available, so with a bit of soldering, hacking, and careful sanding someone could put together a professional looking dongle for their own set-up.
