One of the best and most popular DIY tips I shared in [my newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/garethbranwyn) last year was this one. In this video on _Tech Tangents_, AkBkukU shows how you can use CA/Superglue and baking soda to reconstruct and repair broken plastic hinges, pins, and other parts on old computers and consumer electronics.

You basically use the glue and soda to build up material that you can then sand and file down into the shapes you desire. The resulting material is surprisingly workable, strong, and durable.
