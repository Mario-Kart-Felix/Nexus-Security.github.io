Via [Average Maker](https://twitter.com/Average_Maker), this post focuses on using L9110H motor controller ICs with the ESP8266-based Wemos D1 board. The L9110H is the little cousin to the more famous L293D motor controller.

> L9110H – The Perfect Beginner IC?
> ---------------------------------
> 
> I should give this thing more credit, it’s actually pretty solid for something so cheap and small.
> 
> The L9110H has some handy features that similar chips don’t always offer, which will help beginners (even if they’re not aware of them):
> 
> *   Wide input voltage range – 2.5V-12V
> *   Built-in clamp diodes
> *   Forward & reverse capability
> *   Just 8 pins
> 
> I love that you can make something move with just 8 pins and pretty much any battery pack you’ve likely got lying around the house. Let’s do it!
