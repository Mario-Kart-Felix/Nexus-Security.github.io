[Dr Terrible’s House of Bloggable](https://charliex2.wordpress.com/2019/09/29/using-vna-j-microvna-tiny-and-megiq-vna/) posts about using various software packages to do vector network analysis. From Wikipedia:

> Network analyzers are used mostly at high frequencies; operating frequencies can range from 5 Hz to 1.05 THz. Special types of network analyzers can also cover lower frequency ranges down to 1 Hz. These network analyzers can be used for example for the stability analysis of open loops or for the measurement of audio and ultrasonic components.
> 
> A **vector network analyzer** (VNA) is a form of RF network analyzer widely used for RF design applications. As of 2007, VNAs are the most common type of network analyzers, and so references to an unqualified “network analyzer” most often mean a VNA.

See the [video above](https://charliex2.wordpress.com/2019/09/29/using-vna-j-microvna-tiny-and-megiq-vna/) for an overview of VNA. See [the post](https://charliex2.wordpress.com/2019/09/29/using-vna-j-microvna-tiny-and-megiq-vna/) for various packages. And have a Smith Chart, below.
