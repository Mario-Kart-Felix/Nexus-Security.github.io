\[Ekaggrat Singh Kalsi\] submits this [interesting printer](https://hackaday.io/project/167701-micro-deltesian) he built for his daughter to use. He admits that the project started simply out of curiosity about the strange deltesian movement. In this configuration, the X and Z-axis are a delta mechanism while the Y-axis is a regular Cartesian bed on rails. There’s not a load of advantages to this movement, but it is really neat.

Eventually, he had a hammer in search of a nail and decided to make the printer easy enough for his daughter to use. To this end, he added a few [kid-friendly](https://hackaday.com/2015/11/14/an-e-waste-3d-printer-for-every-child/) modifications. The unheated bed is removable and snaps in and out of place with magnets. Considerable attention was paid to the filament loading and unloading to make it easy for small hands to perform the process. This was accomplished through a lever based latch mechanism.

As you can see in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=BpcdpfpDkwE) after the break, the project was a success, and his daughter is growing up with access to her very own 3D printer.
