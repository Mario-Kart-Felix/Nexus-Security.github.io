qemu vulnerabilities
--------------------

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

*   Ubuntu 14.04 ESM

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in QEMU.

### Software Description

*   qemu - Machine emulator and virtualizer

### Details

USN-4191-2 fixed a vulnerability in QEMU. This update provides the corresponding update for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that the LSI SCSI adapter emulator implementation in QEMU did not properly validate executed scripts. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-12068)

Sergej Schumilo, Cornelius Aschermann and Simon WÃ¶rner discovered that the qxl paravirtual graphics driver implementation in QEMU contained a null pointer dereference. A local attacker in a guest could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-12155)

Riccardo Schirone discovered that the QEMU bridge helper did not properly validate network interface names. A local attacker could possibly use this to bypass ACL restrictions. (CVE-2019-13164)

It was discovered that a heap-based buffer overflow existed in the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU. A local attacker in a guest could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code in the host. (CVE-2019-14378)

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU. A local attacker in a guest could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-15890)
