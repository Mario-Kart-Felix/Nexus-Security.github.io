[Jed Hodson writes](https://prototypingcorner.io/projects/uwb-feather/) on Prototype Corner about a new ATSAMD21 microcontroller board with an integrated [Decawave DWM1000](https://www.decawave.com/product/dwm1000-module/). The DWM1000 module is an IEEE802.15.4-2011 UWB compliant wireless module capable of precision indoor positioning and high data rates, making this board perfect for robotics projects where localization is required. The form factor is the [Adafruit Feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather/feather-specification) size, making the board compatible with over a [hundred additional boards](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-feather/blob/master/README.md).

**Features**:  
– Decawave DWM1000 for precision tracking  
– ARM Cortex M0 for fast & powerful applications  
– Adafruit Feather compatible to integrate with a wide existing ecosystem  
– SWD interface for programming and debugging applications  
– USB-C connector  
– Integrated LiPo battery charger

See the [blog post](https://prototypingcorner.io/projects/uwb-feather/) for further details. The board is released under Creative Commons BY-NC, you have access to all the source code and build files to make your own via [GitHub](https://github.com/prototyping-corner/UWB-Feather).
