VAR Symposium 2019 continued the momentum which was set into motion by [VAR Symposium 2018](https://varindia.com/2018/sna/micro-site/index.html). The coming together of key VARs from across the country along with the sales and marketing professionals from selected corporates and technical leaders set the stage ready for this year’s Symposium. The day-long session witnessed new business strategies being discussed, with a special focus on how to maximize partner profitability, thereby steering their business transformation. A total of 100+ VARs including MSPs, Integrators, Solution Providers and VARs converged, shared ideas and initiated discussions that define the current partner ecosystem in the country.

  

The theme for this year’s event is "Partner Transformation”, and the discussions during the day revolved around this topic. The event commenced with the lamp lighting ceremony in the august presence of guests like [Vipin Tyagi, ED - C-DOT](https://www.varindia.com/news/digital-transformation-and-disruptive-trends-to-drive-the-future-17th-varindia-infotech-forum-1); [Harold D’costa, CEO - IQSS](https://www.varindia.com/news/government-intervention-for-5g-is-a-must);, Dr Ramesh Subramaniam - Motivational; [Kaushik Pandiya, President - FAIITA](https://www.varindia.com/news/faiita-has-chosen-their-next-leadership); [Dr. Deepak Kr.

[Dr Deepak Kr. Sahu, Editor-in-Chief, VARINDIA](https://twitter.com/deepakvarindia) kick-started the event by giving his inaugural speech in which he highlighted the fact of how digitisation is creating tremendous opportunities for economies across the globe. “As a media house, our focus has been Technology, that is at the forefront of everything we do. I think most organisations acknowledge the fact that IT can play an important role to deliver value and competitive edge to the organisation. Many organisations consider such slowdown situation as best opportunity to sharpen their strategy using IT. However, the focus is more on direct tangible outcome projects rather than intangible.”
