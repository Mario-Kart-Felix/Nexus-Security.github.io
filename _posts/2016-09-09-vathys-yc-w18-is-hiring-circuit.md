Vathys is developing transformative hardware with a radical new architecture and new circuit techniques to deliver unprecedented machine learning performance as well as flexibility.

We are hiring a circuit verification engineer in order to perform verification for our circuits as well as some parts of the architecture. Note that this is primarily a circuit level verification problem. For example, ensure that the output of a multiplier is correct and works across multiple corners. Knowledge of SPICE and digital circuits is a requirement.

Compensation ranges from $100K to $150K with exceptions depending on the candidate.

Location is remote.
