> Hello, today I add to the dinosaur collection the fearsome “Velociraptor”, I wanted to represent it in a teenage version and a nice pose as well as easy to print without supports, with a very clean finish and scalable in size without problems, I have obtained very good results by reducing it to 50%, I am already thinking of new dinosaurs to add to the Collection, I hope you like it and see your makes soon.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
