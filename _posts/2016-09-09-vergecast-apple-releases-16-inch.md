This week on [_The Vergecast_](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-vergecast/id430333725), hosts Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, and Paul Miller go through the two big products announced this week: Apple's [16-inch MacBook Pro](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962771/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-hardware-specs-8tb-64gb-price) and Motorola's new [Razr foldable phone](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963294/motorola-razr-new-foldable-smartphone-android-hands-on-flip-phone-photos-video).

How much has Apple changed the [upgraded laptop?](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962380/apples-16-inch-macbook-pro-keyboard-screen-speakers-processor) Is the new [Razr](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/11/13/20963297/motorola-razr-2019-secret-retro-razr-mode-easter-egg-foldable) worth the $1,500 price tag? You'll probably find out if you listen.

In the second half of the show, _Verge_ reporter Julia Alexander stops by to cover [Disney's launch](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20960956/disney-plus-unable-to-connect-error-streaming) of its new streaming service Disney+. Find out how it is and how it will [affect competitors](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20962132/verizon-new-stream-tv-set-top-box-netflix-amazon-fire-tv-chromecast-apple-tv) in the ongoing [streaming wars](https://www.theverge.com/streaming-wars).

There's a whole lot more in between all of that — like Paul's weekly segment "[I'm taking my talents to artificial general intelligence](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963899/john-carmack-stepping-down-cto-of-oculus-work-on-ai)" — so listen through to get it all.
