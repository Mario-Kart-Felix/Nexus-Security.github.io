John Rodgers (Essex-Orleans), would make the possession of a cellphone punishable by up to one year in prison, a $1,000 fine, or both. Rodgers writes within the proposal that cellphones are a large factor in teenage driving deaths and can lead to bullying and radicalization. "In light of the dangerous and life-threatening consequences of cellphone use by young people, it is clear that persons under 21 years of age are not developmentally mature enough to safely possess them," the bill reads. "just as the General Assembly has concluded that persons under 21 years of age are not mature enough to possess firearms, smoke cigarettes or consume alcohol." In an interview with the Times Argus Wednesday, Rodgers said the bill was introduced to raise conversation, and he does not expect it to pass. "I have no delusions that it's going to pass," he told reporter Eric Blaisdell. "I wouldn't probably vote for it myself."The senator's comparison to other age-increasing legislation comes after two consecutive sessions that saw similar bills introduced — In 2018 the state decided to raise the purchasing age for firearms to 21, and in 2019 it raised the purchasing age to 21 for tobacco products. While several states have placed a ban on people under 21 years old using their cellphone while driving, none have introduced an all-encompassing age limit.
