Trains are great for hauling massive amounts of cargo from point A to point B, and occasionally, point C on weekends. But they’re not really known for climbing hills well, and anything vertical is right out. Regardless, \[Can Altineller\] knows what he wants and set to work, [creating the 3D Printed Wall Train](https://altineller.ca/post/117263513195/3d-printed-vertical-train).

The first step was to get the train to stick to a vertical surface. This was achieved with the use of neodymium magnets in the train, which are attracted to laser-cut steel plates beneath the plastic tracks. The train itself consists of a custom 3D printed locomotive, outfitted with a motor and step-down gears that drive all four wheels. Said wheels are of a conical shape, and covered with rubber to provide enough grip to overcome gravity. The project is [a progression from \[Cal\]’s earlier four-motor build](https://altineller.ca/post/117260656490/the-vertical-wall-train).

The final result is a charming wall display, with the four-wheel drive train merrily tugging its carriages around the circular course ad infinitum. It’s a fun build, and we’d love to see similar techniques applied to a bigger layout. If this whets your appetite for model railroading, [consider building your own turntable](https://hackaday.com/2019/01/11/a-turntable-for-model-railroads/), or [implementing some fancy sensors](https://hackaday.com/2017/06/27/tiniest-control-board-fits-inside-an-n-gauge-model-train/).
