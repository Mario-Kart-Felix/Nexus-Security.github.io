The [Maduino blog](https://maduinos.blogspot.com/) has posted video tutorials on using [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) in Korean. They have two videos according to [their Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/maduinos):

*   [RPi Lecture # 1-Is CircuitPython far away?](https://maduinos.blogspot.com/2019/11/rpi-lecture-1-circuitpython.html)
*   [RPi Lecture # 2-Configuring CircuitPython](https://maduinos.blogspot.com/2019/11/rpi-lecture-2-circuitpython.html)

Via Google Translate at the website [maduinos.blogspot.com](https://maduinos.blogspot.com/):

> This time, let’s take a look at CircuitPython which I learned while trying to play with Raspberry Pi.
> 
> CircuitPython is a language designed to simplify programming on inexpensive microcontroller boards. If Arduino is programmed in C, CircuitPython will be a language that controls hardware based on Python, as its name suggests.
> 
> As you know, Python is currently growing fast and is being used in a variety of ways. That’s because it’s easy to learn, based on the language intuition and various libraries that Python has. That’s why CircuitPython is easy to learn.
> 
> It’s only a few days now, but it supports a variety of boards based on Arm processors, so please refer to [https://circuitpython.org/downloads](https://circuitpython.org/downloads) to find out which boards are supported.

> CircuitPython supports not only microcontrollers but also SBCs (Single Board Computer)  through a library called ‘Blinka’. I‘m going to use the Blinka library to play with a Raspberry Pi, one of SBC’s flagship boards. Blinka seems to have been working on a development project at ‘adafruit’ which I learned about Arduino. So it’s very likely that Adafruit supports a lot of breakout boards. _(Ed: Yes, 56+ at last count)._
> 
> Let’s deal with the application of a variety of sensors using the Raspberry Pi Raspberry Pi.  8 bit microcontrollers such as Arduino and OS-based SBCs such as Raspberry Pi have different uses from the start, so the tutorial won’t be long. We also run it on YouTube. If you are interested, please subscribe ~:)
