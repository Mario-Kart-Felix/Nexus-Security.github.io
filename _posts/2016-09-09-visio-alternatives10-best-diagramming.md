Microsoft Visio is used by most of the major corporations and the fortune 500 companies as a diagramming tool. With its collection of 70 built-in templates and 4000 unique shapes, it is the go-to tool for anyone who wants to display information which can be easily visualized. With Visio, you can create business diagrams, process diagrams, flowcharts, floor plans, and more. However, the biggest benefit of using Visio is its seamless connection with various data sources such as Excel, SQL Servers, and SharePoint. It pulls the data on a live-basis keeping your diagrams up to date, giving you a one-stop solution for all your data visualization needs. Still it has its shortcomings including a high price tag and an aging UI. That’s why, in this article we are going to take a look at 10 best diagramming software which are the best Visio alternatives you can use in 2019.  

Best Microsoft Visio Alternatives in 2019
-----------------------------------------

  

Before we get to our list of the best diagramming tools that you can use to replace Visio, let us first take a look at some of the reasons why you should replace the app in the first place. With that said, let’s check out the reasons, shall we?  

### Why The Need for Microsoft Visio Alternatives?

  

In short, Microsoft Visio is great, but it’s also really costly, with **Visio subscription plans starting at $5/month for basics and $15/month for the pro version**. That is if you opt for the yearly plan. If you are going to pay monthly, it’s going to cost even more. The worst part is that unlike before, there’s no onetime buying system so you are stuck with the subscription pricing. If you aren’t planning to use all its features, there’s no point in paying such a hefty recurrent price for a piece of software, especially when there are so many open-source and cheaper yet similarly capable alternatives out there. Also, Visio’s interface looks dated, and it has become a bloated software over the years. So, if these drawbacks concern you and you are someone who is looking for a Visio alternative, here are 10 best Visio alternative diagramming software:  

List of Best Microsoft Visio Alternatives
-----------------------------------------

  

1\. LucidChart
--------------

  

If you search Google for Microsoft Visio, LucidChart will be just next to the Visio results, and rightly so. LucidChart is the biggest competitor to Visio and they don’t shy from making fun of its competition. But, advertisement aside, this is one of the best diagramming software available in the market today. The software is **based on HTML5 and Javascript and works as a web app** inside your browser. With this software, you can create flowcharts, wireframe diagrams, UML diagrams, smartphone mockups and more.  

### Why You Should Opt for LucidChart?

  

If you are just starting out and don’t have a team, then LucidChart is best for you, as **it’s free for personal use**. You need to pay only if you are buying this for a team. Secondly, it offers a seamless transition experience from Visio, as **it can easily import Visio files**. This means if you are collaborating with an external team who uses Visio, you will have no problem. Also, **since it is a web-based app, it is cross-platform**. They even offer a free iPad app. Lastly, the software is fully featured and you will never feel waiting for features if you are switching from Visio. The best part is that it packs all the power yet makes it really easy to use.  

### Key Features:

  

Easy to Learn, Visio compatible (can import.vdx, .vsd, or .vsdx files), fully integrated with other productivity tools (such as G suite, Confluence etc), multiple sharing options (PDF, Image, embed into webpage), and multiple diagrams creation including flowcharts, wireframe diagrams, UML diagrams, smartphone mockups and more.  

_**Supported Platforms:** Windows, macOS, and Linux (since its a web app it works on any modern web-browser including Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari), iPad._  

_**Pricing:** Free (Single user with feature restriction), starting at $20/month (3 members) for teams (no restriction)._

2\. yED Graph Editor
--------------------

  

If you are looking for a **completely free diagramming software** which runs on all the major platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux/Unix, take a look at yED Graph Editor. The best part about this software is that despite being cross-platform, it’s not a web app which means **you get a native app irrespective of the platform you are using**. That is something everyone will appreciate. I don’t think web-apps are still at that level that they can replace native apps, and hence, yED scores a big point here. When it comes to features, the software is no slouch. You can either manually create diagrams or use its automatic tool which **automatically creates diagrams from imported data**.  

### Why You Should Opt for yED Graph Editor?

  

The first reason to opt for yED is that **it is completely free and has native apps for all the major platforms**. Secondly, although its feature set is not as rich as either Visio or LucidChart, it is good enough for 90% of the users. Only the exceptionally power users will find missing features here. The automatic layout algorithms are really good at creating diagrams from imported data.  

### Key Features:

  

Cross-Platform native apps, automatic layout algorithms, feature rich, high-quality diagrams, and multiple diagram creation including Flowcharts, UML diagrams, Family trees and Semantic networks.  

_**Supported Platforms:** Windows, macOS, and Linux/Unix (native applications)._  

_**Pricing:** Free_

3\. Ardoq
---------

  

If you work in a field where you constantly need to **showcase complex information in easy to understand visual diagrams** or graphs, Ardoq is the one for you. Let me make this clear first, it’s not a cheap software, in fact, it’s the costliest software on this list by far, but it is worth every penny for its target customers. Specially **designed for architects, developers, process owners, project managers, and business owners**, it has an assembly of tools which can take complex data sets and convert them into easy to understand diagrams. It can import data on a live basis making sure that all your diagrams are up to date at any point in time.

  
  

  

### Why You Should Opt for Ardoq?

  

As I mentioned earlier, Ardoq is best for people who **work with large sets of complex datasets**. If you are one of those people, this is a no-brainer for you.

You can also **automate repetitive tasks by creating custom shortcuts**. Everything about Ardoq is aimed at helping you create diagrams in the easiest and the fastest way possible.

4\. OmniGraffle 7
-----------------

  

OmniGraffle is **by far the best looking diagramming tool** out there. The only sad part is that it is only available for the macOS system, hence, Windows users cannot make use of this awesome software. When you open OmniGraffle, you will fall in love with its user interface. The team at OmniGraffle has nailed the user experience. When you get past the beauty of its interface, you will find that it is also **one of the easiest diagram software to learn**. When it comes to features, OmniGraffle goes head-to-head with the best software on this list. If you own a Mac, OmniGraffle can be the best diagram software for you.  

### Why You Should Opt for OmniGraffle 7?

It also supports both imports and exports of Visio files along with **automation tools created with JavaScript and AppleScript**. With OmniGraffle, you can create precise, beautiful graphics of website wireframes, electrical systems, family trees, maps of software classes, and more.
