In this fascinating video, maker and amateur scientist, Ben of [NightHawkInLight](https://www.youtube.com/user/Nighthawkinlight/), uses fire to show the directional resistance that a Telsa value creates.

The [Tesla value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_valve), patented by Nicola Tesla in 1920, employs a series of restricting fins arranged in such a way that a liquid or gas can flow freely in one direction while greatly resisting flow in the opposite direction. Using ignited propane and slow-motion photography, you can clearly see how this directional resistance is achieved with no moving parts.
