Fun project from [erindavis](https://erdavis.com/2020/01/04/visualizing-the-geography-of-fm-radio/) who “makes stuff with data.” These maps show the different ranges of broadcasting. Different maps are even broken down into categories. The blog post lays out methodology and sources. Via [Data Stuff](https://erdavis.com/2020/01/04/visualizing-the-geography-of-fm-radio/):
