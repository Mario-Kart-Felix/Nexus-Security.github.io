Vivo S1 with a waterdrop notch and triple cameras launched in India back in August last year. The Chinese giant has now added a “Pro” variant to the S1 lineup to provide you a more well-rounded camera experience. Vivo S1 Pro sports a quad-camera setup that’s housed in a diamond-shaped cutout and is backed by a Snapdragon chipset as opposed to the MediaTek one aboard the standard Vivo S1.  

Vivo S1 Pro: Specs and Features
-------------------------------

  

Vivo is still sticking with a plastic construction but ups the premium factor (which is also the distinguishing factor) by adding a [diamond-shaped camera module](https://www.vivo.com/in/products/s1pro) on the rear. The company has painted the edges of the phone’s body differently and added an accented power button to round up the kitty.  

Vivo S1 Pro features a 6.38-inch Full-HD+ Super AMOLED display with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio and 1080 x 2340 pixels resolution. There’s a waterdrop notch up-top and a rather larger bottom bezel as compared to all other sides of the screen. You will also find an in-display fingerprint scanner onboard.

I know, we have seen a lot of phones **powered by the Snapdragon 665 chipset** in the sub-Rs. 10,000 price bracket. The same chipset runs the show under the hood on the Vivo S1 Pro but at a rather exorbitant price. It’s paired with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage.  

In the camera department, Vivo S1 Pro boasts a diamond-shaped camera bump (which we first saw on the [Vivo S5](https://beebom.com/vivo-s5-launch-specs-leaked/) in China) and includes a 48MP (f/1.8) primary sensor. It’s coupled with an 8MP (f/2.2) ultra-wide lens, a 2MP depth sensor, and a dedicated 2MP macro lens. There’s also a 32MP (f/2.0) selfie camera baked into the waterdrop notch on the front.

Vivo S1 Pro comes equipped with a **4,500mAh battery pack** with 18W Dual Engine fast charging support. It boasts all essential connectivity options, including a USB Type-C port, and runs Android Pie-based FunTouch OS 9.2 out-of-the-box.  

Price and Availability
----------------------

  

Vivo S1 Pro has been launched in a single 8GB RAM and 128GB storage configuration. It has today gone on **sale for a pricey Rs 19,990** at both online and offline stores. You’re free to choose from among 3 color variants namely Mystic Black, Jazy Blue, and Dreamy White.  

If you are looking to shell out around Rs 20,000 on a mid-range phone, I would suggest you go for the Realme X2. It offers you Snapdragon 730G chipset, 64MP camera, VOOC charging 4.0, and a lot more. Dislike the notch? You can pick the Redmi K20 with a full-screen bezel-less experience if that’s the case.
