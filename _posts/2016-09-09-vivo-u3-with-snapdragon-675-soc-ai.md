After the launch of Vivo U3x, the company has now officially teased the announcement of Vivo U3 with AI triple rear cameras, Snapdragon 675 SoC, and more. The teaser image posted by Vivo China reveals that the U3x will sport a Halo FullView display, will be powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 processor and will likely sport 4GB/6GB RAM with 128GB internal storage. The image also shows the rear of the phone with AI triple rear cameras and physical fingerprint scanner. In related news, a Vivo phone with model number V1914A/T surfaced on TENAA a while back with key specifications like 6.53-inch FULL HD+ display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 processor, and 16MP (primary) + 8MP (ultra-wide) + 2MP(depth sensor) and 16MP front camera. Going by the TENAA certification and the official teaser, Vivo U3x must be the V1914A/T model. Vivo U3 will go on pre-sale starting October 21st 2019, and we should know more information in the coming days. Source
