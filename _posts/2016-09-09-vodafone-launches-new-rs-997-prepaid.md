On similar lines now, Vodafone has launched new Rs. 997 prepaid recharge plan with benefits like unlimited calling, 1.5GB data per day, and more. This comes after the launch of Rs. 99 and Rs. 555 prepaid plans and this new Rs. 997 prepaid plan offers 1.5GB of data per day along with Unlimited Calling, 100 SMS and comes with 180 days validity. Additional benefits include Vodafone Play subscription worth Rs. 499 and Zee5 subscription worth Rs. 999. To compare, the Rs. 599 plan comes with similar benefits but has a validity of 84 days. The new prepaid plan is not available in all circles as of now and is expected to be available in all circles soon. Similarly, to compare, Airtel and Reliance offer Rs. 598, Rs. 599 prepaid plans, but they don't offer 180 days validity. Hopefully, other operators will also introduce similar plans soon.
