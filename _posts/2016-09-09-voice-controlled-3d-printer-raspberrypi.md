> I hate using the control panel of my 3D printer to tweak its settings. Sometimes when I need to preheat the hotend or the bed, I have to navigate through a bunch of menus using an encoder that is too outdated in this age of voice control and AI.
> 
> This project will let you control your 3D printer using a RaspberryPi and the power of your voice!
> 
> It also has some handy features such as active power monitoring, and even shuts the printer down when it exceeds a preset current limit. **(specially if there’s a nasty electrical short that can lead to fire)**
