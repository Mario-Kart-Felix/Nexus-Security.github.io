Here’s a great voice control media station project from [Sid](https://www.hackster.io/shiva-siddharth) via [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/shiva-siddharth/voice-controlled-pi-based-media-station-fb2481):

> This is not your typical Kodi based media player implemented using Pi. This features voice control and built-in Google Assistant. The Kodi is invoked by wakeword “Kodi” (if you want some other wakeword, of course you can change) and the Google Assistant with the usual “Hey Google” and “Ok Google” wakeword. Commands issued with “Kodi” wakeword is processed for Kodi control and “Hey Google” or “Ok Google” wakeword is processed for queries.
