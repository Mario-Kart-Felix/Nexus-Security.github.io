FEW WORDS ABOUT OUR COMPANY

  

Volta Labs builds systems for automating complex biological workflows on a programmable chip (a microprocessor for biology). Building our system touches many fields: electrical engineering, material science, biology, robotics and computer science. Our team uses a breadth of skills spanning across these fields to solve problems that no one field can solve. Our ultimate goal is to establish the infrastructure required for future biological factories.

  

We are an early stage company spun off from the MIT Media Lab and founded with genomics expert

[George Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_M._Church)

. We were incubated at the

[MIT Engine](http://engine.xyz/)

and we just came out of

[Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/)

.

  

THE OPPORTUNITY

  

We are in the processing of gathering people with an interdisciplinary mindset to form the foundations of what will become the company over the next few years. You will come on board as an early member of the team and grow with our engineering organization. You will work collaboratively with a team of engineers, biologists and scientists and take responsibility to drive all things related to electrical engineering. This will involve: supporting our engineers and scientists in developing the core technology and taking full responsibility in architecting the electrical system for our MVP.

  

THE TEAM

  

You’ll join a team where everyone—including you—is not afraid to go into unexplored territories across many fields to build our automation system. We are an incredibly supportive team–we love to pitch in when problems arise and give great peer feedback to help each other grow. We are passionate about lots of things--automation, biology, computation, robotics, fabrication, industrial design, great user experience for customers--and we love sharing those passions with each other. You'll be a key driver of instilling these values in our new Cambridge office and play a big role in helping grow the team.
