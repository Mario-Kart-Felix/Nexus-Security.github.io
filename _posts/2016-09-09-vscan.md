**Vscan - Vulnerability Scanner Tool Using Nmap And Nse Scripts**

  

  
vulnerability scanner tool is using nmap and nse scripts to find vulnerabilities  
This tool puts an additional value into [vulnerability scanning](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Vulnerability%20Scanning "vulnerability scanning") with nmap. It uses NSE scripts which can add flexibility in terms of [vulnerability detection](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Vulnerability%20Detection "vulnerability detection") and exploitation. Below there are some of the features that NSE scripts provide

*   Network discovery
*   More sophisticated version detection
*   Vulnerability detection
*   Backdoor detection
*   Vulnerability exploitation

This tool uses the path `/usr/share/nmap/scripts/` where the nse scripts are located in kali linux  
The tool performs the following

*   check the communication to the target hosts by cheking icmp requests
*   takes as input a protocol name such as http and executes all nse scripts related to that protocol
*   if any [vulnerability](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Vulnerability "vulnerability") triggers it saves the output into a log file
*   it may perform all of the above actions for a range of IP addresses

If the tool finds a vulnerabilty in a certain protocol (e.g http) it keeps the output into a log file which is created and saved in the following location `/home/vulnerabilities_enumeration/http_vulnerabilities/http_vulnerabilities/http_vulnerabilities.txt` In this example the folders have been created using the protocol prefix which in the current occasion is the http protocol.
