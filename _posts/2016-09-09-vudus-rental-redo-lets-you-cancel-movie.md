If you rent a movie from Vudu the company is now offering you the chance to change your mind about it. Rental Redo means that you can get your money back on a movie rental as long as you stop watching it within the first 30 minutes. Which is a cracking deal.

Vudu Offers Money Back on Movie Rentals
---------------------------------------

Vudu announced **Rental Redo** in a post on [the Vudu Blog](https://blog.vudu.com/get-more-movie-nights-this-winter-with-rental-redo-our-low-price-promise/). The company describes Rental Redo as “just like having a gift receipt for your movie”. This is because “if you decide your rental is not for you within the first 30 minutes, Vudu will give you a redo.

A redo in this context is “a credit equal to the price of the rental”. And all you need to do to claim it is stop watching the film within the first 30 minutes. Then, call or email Vudu’s Customer Care team, who will credit your account within 24 hours.

> Best Holiday Surprise. Ever. Rent risk-free with our Rental Redo (“redo” your rental if you don’t like it within 30 minutes) and Low Price Promise. Use the promo code to save 50% off any rental: [https://t.co/2MV9ER9zCB](https://t.co/2MV9ER9zCB).

Rental Redo isn’t available for movies you have already downloaded. This is because Vudu wouldn’t be able to stop you watching a movie you’ve downloaded, even if you did request a refund. And Vudu isn’t dumb enough to leave such an obvious loophole open.

Vudu is offering other sweeteners for the holidays. Its **Low Price Promise** means Vudu will credit the difference if you find a movie available to rent cheaper elsewhere. It’s also offering **Weekly Rental Deals**, starting with 50 percent off your next rental.

Rental Redo is a great idea. After all, a trailer can trick you into thinking a movie is better than it actually is. This way, you can change your mind if and when you realize you’ve been suckered in. Which should give Vudu an edge over the competition.
