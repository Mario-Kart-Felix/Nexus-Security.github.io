The Vulnerability -  
The vulnerability allows the attacker to join a meeting if they have the meeting ID or meeting URL from the mobile device browser. Then the browser will launch the meeting on Webex mobile application, and then the unauthenticated user can join the password-protected meeting without the said browser. “The unauthorized attendee will be visible in the attendee list of the meeting as a mobile attendee,” reads the Cisco blog post.  
  
This makes it quite easy to track the unauthorized individual as they will be visible as a mobile attendee. This Cisco Webex vulnerability has received a score of 7.2 out of 10 (can be tracked as CVE-2020-3142). Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) said that they have not yet faced an attacker exploiting the vulnerability. Versions with the vulnerability - The vulnerability is seen in Cisco Webex Meetings Suite sites and Cisco Webex Meetings Online versions earlier than 39.11.5 and 40.1.3. Though Cisco says that the Webex meeting server is unaffected with the vulnerability.  
  
After discovering the vulnerability, Cisco has now released a new version fixing the vulnerability in versions 39.11.5 and later 40.1.3 for Cisco Webex Meetings Suite sites and Cisco Webex Meetings Online sites. “The fix applies to Cisco Webex Meetings Suite sites and Cisco Webex Meetings sites only. Customers are not required to update the Cisco Webex Meetings mobile application or the Cisco Webex Meetings desktop application.”  
  
Cisco recently fixed 11 more bugs in Cisco Data Center Network Manager when the faults let hackers RCE, SQL Injection, and Authentication Bypass Attacks. Cisco is expected to fix the bug soon. The users are advised to stay careful of any suspicious activity and report to the company immediately if they found any malicious activity on the platform.
