Wakey Control your screen sleep and brightness Premium 6.5.1 APK For Android

Wakey keeps your screen on, depending on your conditions - makes it really bright, dark, or even completely dark - but the phone is still awake and working. Wakey can also be configured to keep your screen on when certain apps or games are active, or when the device is charging, or even when you are watching the device.  
Wakey is battery compatible - it will only keep the screen awake when you need it. You can activate it manually with the big bulb directly in the app at any time, then touch it again or use the notification to deactivate it.
