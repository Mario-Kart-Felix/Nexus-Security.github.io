If you’re already looking for [Black Friday 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20951389/black-friday-deals-best-tech-gadgets-walmart-amazon-target-how-to-save) deals, Walmart is among the first of the major retailers to serve them up. It’s hard to consider them as true Black Friday deals since they’re launching before the big shopping day. Nevertheless, the deals are good, and they are likely a strong sign of what other sale prices are expected in the next few weeks.

Walmart’s collection of pre-Black Friday deals is constantly changing, so we’ll be updating this post as new deals arrive from now until Black Friday, which kicks off on Friday, November 29th.

The best Black Friday deals from Walmart so far

[Apple Watch Series 3 (GPS + LTE, 38mm) is $199](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-Cellular-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case-Silver-White%2F728936788) right now. This is usually the cost for the GPS-only model, so if you’re looking for a watch that can track your location and can serve as a stand-in for your phone, this is worth checking out. This is around $40 cheaper than other retailers at the time of writing.

[Lenovo’s Legion Y545 gaming laptop (15.6-inch display, Intel Core i7 CPU, 16GB RAM, Nvidia RTX 2060, 512GB PCIe SSD) is $1,099 right now](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLaptop-Hexa-Core-Processor-RAM-i7-9750H-PCIe-Black-Intel-GeForce-Nvidia-6GB-Y545-RTX-16GB-Core-Lenovo-81Q6000QUS-Card-SSD-2060-Graphics-512GB-Storage%2F560161624) (usually $1,599). Any laptop with Nvidia’s ray tracing-enabled graphics card for less than $1,200 deserves your attention, so you should check this deal out while it’s available.

The [second-generation Apple AirPods truly wireless headphones are $144](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Fathcpid%3D604342441%26athpgid%3DathenaHomepage%26athcgid%3Dnull%26athznid%3DBestInDeals%26athieid%3Dv1%26athstid%3DCS020%26athguid%3D466001f5-46cfa622-42efd1179a18a716%26athancid%3Dnull%26athena%3Dtrue), down from $159. These rarely see a discount, though this sale price has been making appearances at various retailers for the past few weeks.

Apple’s previous generation iPad with Wi-Fi and cellular capabilities is more affordable than it is at other retailers. [The tablet with 128GB of storage costs $399](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-6th-Gen-128GB-Wi-Fi-Cellular%2F536086915), and is unlocked for use with most US carriers. For reference, the 32GB Wi-Fi + cellular model costs $459 at Best Buy, so this is a great deal if you want a tablet with a lot of storage. [The same model costs $299 at Walmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-6th-Gen-32GB-Wi-Fi-Cellular-Gold%2F371098880).

It usually costs $129, so this is a small, but welcome discount. The [Google Home smart speaker that regularly costs $100 is down to $79](https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Home-Smart-Speaker-Google-Assistant%2F54742302).
