After [acquiring InExile Entertainment last year](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-acquires-wasteland-bards-tale-studio-inxile-e/1100-6463149/), Microsoft confirmed during [its X019 livestream](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/x019-inside-xbox-news-halo-reach-coming-to-mcc-new/1100-6471272/) that the studio's upcoming RPG, [Wasteland 3](https://www.gamespot.com/wasteland-3/), will launch on May 19 for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

Before wrapping up the livestream, InExile boss Brian Fargo announced [the game's release date](https://www.inxile-entertainment.com/wasteland3) alongside a brand-new trailer that was incredibly chilling. The "1987" trailer, below, shows survivors battling computerized enemies in a snow-covered Colorado devasted by bombs.

Fargo, who is [expected to retire after Wasteland 3 ships](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inxile-boss-brian-fargo-to-retire-after-wasteland-/1100-6448961/), said the game was designed as a standalone experience. He also confirmed that no previous knowledge of the Wasteland series, nor playing [Wasteland](https://www.gamespot.com/wasteland/) or [Wasteland 2](https://www.gamespot.com/wasteland-2/), is necessary to jump into Wasteland 3.

Wasteland 3 was [announced three years ago](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wasteland-3-announced-features-co-op-and-vehicles/1100-6443998/) through crowdfunding site Fig. Since then, the project has [surpassed $3 million](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wasteland-3-passes-3-million-new-stretch-goals-unl/1100-6444654/) and [made an appearance at E3 2019](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2019-wasteland-3-gets-a-chilly-new-trailer/1100-6467545/). We were able to [go hands-on with Wasteland 3](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wasteland-3-is-a-massive-upgrade-from-its-predeces/1100-6469334/), where we said the game is "shaping up to be a solid follow-up that maintains the level of choice and agency from its predecessor--while also really seeing the stakes with its increased production quality."
