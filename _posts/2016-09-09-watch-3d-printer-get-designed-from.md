Too often when you see a build video, you only get to see the final product. Even if there’s footage of the build itself, it’s usually only the highlights as a major component is completed. But thankfully that’s not the case with the [“V-Baby” CoreXY 3D printer](https://hackaday.io/project/165523-v-baby-corexy) that \[Roy Berntsen\] has been working on.

Watching through [his playlist of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbPNETX55xSmn3s6fIVaMbz-eXo9Rz-0l), you’re able to see him tackle his various design goals. For example he’d like the final design to be both machinable _and_ printable, which is possible, but it certainly adds complexity and time. He also transitions from a triangular base to a rectangular one at some point. These decisions, and the reasons behind them, are all documented and discussed.

Towards the end of the series we can see the final testing and torturing process as he ramps up to a final design release. This should definitely demystify the process for anyone attempting their [first 3D printer design from scratch](https://hackaday.com/2016/07/06/build-a-3d-printer-workhorse/).
