Two International Space Station (ISS) astronauts are completing a spacewalk today to fix a dark matter experiment and you can the repair operation live on [NASA TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evaBhht5uGA).

  

At 6:39 a.m. EST, Expedition 61 Commander¬†Luca Parmitano (European Space Agency) and NASA flight engineer Andrew Morgan went outside the [space station](https://www.geek.com/news/watch-first-all-female-spacewalk-is-underway-at-international-space-station-1807837/) to replace a cooling system on the [Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS)](https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2019/11/15/veteran-spacewalkers-begin-complex-work-to-repair-cosmic-particle-detector/), a cosmic ray detector. This is the first spacewalk in a series of many that will fix the experiment, which was built to find dark matter in space, [Space.com noted](https://www.space.com/space-station-astronauts-first-ams-repair-spacewalk-webcast.html).

  

  

Parmitano is wearing the suit with red stripes and helmet camera No. 11, while Morgan is sporting a suit with no stripes and helmet camera No. 18.

The first spacewalk will involve both astronauts positioning materials, taking out a debris cover on the AMS, and placing handrails in preparation for upcoming spacewalks. The astronauts are expected to complete the tasks in approximately six-and-a-half hours.

According to [NASA](https://www.geek.com/news/nasas-juno-spacecraft-snaps-swirly-jovian-vortex-view-1810048/), AMS is a joint effort between NASA and the Department of Energy‚Äôs Office of Science. AMS has been capturing high-energy cosmic rays, so researchers can answer important questions about antimatter, the unseen [‚Äúdark matter‚Äù](https://www.geek.com/news/cygnus-resupply-mission-is-bringing-these-cool-experiments-to-the-space-station-1808918/) that makes up most of the mass in the universe and weird dark energy that‚Äôs responsible for expanding the cosmos.

  

NASA has not shared a date for the second AMS repair spacewalk yet.
