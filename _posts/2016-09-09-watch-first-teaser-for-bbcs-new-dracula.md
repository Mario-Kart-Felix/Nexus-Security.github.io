Sign me up for ANYTHING from the creators of the amazingly entertaining Cumberbatch + Freeman _Sherlock_. We heard it first from [Tor.com](https://www.tor.com/2019/10/28/watch-the-first-teaser-for-bbcs-new-dracula-series-from-the-creators-of-sherlock/).

> Action-nuns! Body horror! Dracula with a British (not Transylvanian) accent! Over the weekend, the BBC dropped the very first teaser for Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss’ adaptation of Bram Stoker’s novel, and it (understandably) looks way darker than Sherlock. 
> 
> The super-short clip is light on the dialog but stuffed with blink-and-you’ll-miss-it shots of all the spooky paraphernalia you’d expect from a Dracula adaptation (jugular-slitting nails, portentous crucifixes, wooden stakes–wielded by nuns, no less!), and then some. We also get a glimpse of a contortionist monster of some kind (could this be Dracula in hangry mode?), an uncomfortably long shot of someone’s extra-juicy wrist veins, and a good, hard look at the titular vampire count, played by Claes Bang.
