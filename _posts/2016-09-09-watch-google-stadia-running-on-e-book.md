Sebastian Ørsted, a Danish Ph.D. student from Aarhus University’s Department of Mathematics managed to get Google Stadia running on something nobody would have expected – an e-book reader.  

As _[Vice](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/dygvdq/you-can-play-google-stadia-on-an-e-book-reader)_ reports, **the e-book reader was [Onyx Boox Max 3](https://onyxboox.com/boox_max3), running on Android Pie**. It has a 13.3-inch touch screen e-ink display and a 4300mAh battery. Ørsted estimated that he had lag between 500 and 1000 milliseconds, which is surprising for an e-ink display.  

As you might expect, **the gameplay is choppy** and is not even playable by gamer standards. However, the fact that it works is incredible and unusual. _“So this setup would obviously be useless for any practical video game experience. But as a tech demonstration, I think it’s really cool that it works at all.”,_ Ørsted told Vice.  

It appears like the Boox Max 3 has a high refresh rate mode called “X-mode” aimed at heavier tasks like playing videos. **The performance of the game improved after he enabled X-mode**. _“At first, the experience was quite bad. I was surprised, myself, at how well it suddenly went”,_ he added.  

In case you’re interested to test out Stadia on different Android devices, you can bypass the compatibility check by following this [trick](https://beebom.com/play-google-stadia-games-any-android-phone/) or by using this [Xposed module](https://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/xposed-xtadia-play-stadia-games-t4022113). Make sure you have an active Stadia subscription and a stable internet connection before you get started.
