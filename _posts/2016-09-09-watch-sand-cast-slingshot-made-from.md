[![](https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/sand-casted-slingshot.jpg?w=250)](https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/sand-casted-slingshot.jpg)Sand-casting metal parts is a technique that has been around for a very long time, but it can be educational to see the process from start to finish. That’s exactly what \[Frederico\] shows us with [his sand-cast slingshot of his own design](https://www.manmademayhem.com/?p=3665), and it’s not bad for what he says is a first try!

First, \[Frederico\] makes a two-part [green sand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_casting#Green_sand) mold of the slingshot body. Green sand is a sand and clay mix, and is only _green_ in the sense that it is wet or “raw” and not further processed. After the mold is made, it’s time to melt aluminum in the propane-powered furnace, and the molten aluminum is then poured into the mold.

After cooling, \[Frederico\] breaks up the sand to reveal the rough cast object. There is post-processing to do in the form of sprues to cut and some flashing around the seams to remove, but overall it looks to have turned out well. You can watch the whole process in the video, embedded below.

Sand casting is an old technology, but it makes friends easily and [isn’t afraid to be seen with new kids on the block like 3D printing](https://hackaday.com/2018/07/14/casting-a-3d-printed-extruder-body-in-aluminum/).
