> Hi, I’m a hobbyist watchmaker, this is a watch hand press, I always want to have a more sturdy way to install watch hands, but I already own a nice set of Horotec watch hand installing tools, so I don’t want to buy a watch hand press if I can just design one using the nice tools I have.

> so I design one, the dimensions are for Horotec watch hand tools, please measure your tools before printing this out, dimensions are in the photos, enjoy.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
