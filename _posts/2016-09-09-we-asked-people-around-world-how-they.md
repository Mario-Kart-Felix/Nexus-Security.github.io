### **When we look at this data as a whole, what story does it start to tell us?**

People are concerned about artificial intelligence. They are also curious and hopeful and excited for what it might bring--as long as it doesn’t bring about world destruction. People are also somewhat interested in learning more about AI. They might not be super excited about it yet, but they are open minded and aware that they need to pay attention. This is good.

Over the next couple of years, [Mozilla plans to focus on making sure the world builds trustworthy AI](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/mozillas-approach-to-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence-ai/). We want to help people understand that we all can and should have a say in when algorithms and computers are making decisions for us.
