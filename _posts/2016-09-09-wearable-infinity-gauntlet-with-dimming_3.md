> This is a remix of the Wearable Infinity Gauntlet. I made it so that when you make a fist, the LEDs and stones brighten for a more realistic effect. I added a battery cage for a rechargeable battery, and a desktop stand with the Avengers Infinity War logo with a switch on the side for desktop use.

> Gauntlet:  
> Printed at 100% scale and used bondo to link the two palm pieces. I wish I would have printed slightly larger for my hands to fit in a little better. Spray painted with metallic gold and then dusted with gunmetal grey to give a slightly worn affect.
> 
> Stones:  
> Used a Dremel to carefully carve the stones down to size. Use a lighter to slightly melt the acrylic and make it clear again. I used some sand paper on the backs of the stones to make the led diffuse light a little better from behind. Used super glue to hold in place.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And donâ€™t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!
