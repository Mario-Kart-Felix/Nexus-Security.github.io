> Swedish retailer Carlings has released its augmented-reality The Last Statement T-shirt, which can show a variety of political messages.
> 
> Developed for the brand by creative agency Virtue, the T-shirt is nearly blank to the naked eye. Viewed through a phone, however, it sports a bold, animated design that comments on a political topic of the day.
> 
> The wearer can choose from a range of graphics created especially for The Last Statement T-shirt and accessible through the Instagram or Facebook apps, where it works on the same principle as face filters.
