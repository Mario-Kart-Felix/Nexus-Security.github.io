These lights will let you know the weather.

Clever idea shared by [natethecoder](https://www.instructables.com/member/natethecoder/) on [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/Weather-Alert-Light-System/):

> The weather alert lighting system changes lighting to indicate different weather warnings or watches. This system leverages freely accessible weather data to make a lighting change to indicate weather status. A raspberry pi (via node-red) checks the weather data regularly and turns on a red light when there is severe weather(warning), a yellow light to indicate threatening weather(watch), a snowflake for impending snow, and a regular lamp to signify clear skies.
