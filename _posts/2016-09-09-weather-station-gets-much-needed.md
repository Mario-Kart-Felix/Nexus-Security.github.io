Weather stations are a popular project, partly because it’s helpful (and interesting) to know about the weather at your exact location rather than a forecast that might be vaguely in your zip code. They’re also popular because they’re a good way to get experience with microcontrollers, sensors, I/O, and communications protocols. Your own build may also be easily upgradeable as the years go by, and \[Tysonpower\] shows us some of the [upgrades he’s made to the popular Sparkfun weather station](https://tysonpower.de/blog/esp8266-weather-station) from a few years ago.

[The Sparkfun station](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/weather-meter-hookup-guide) is a good basis for a build though, it just needs some updates. The first was that the sensor package isn’t readily available though, but some hunting on Aliexpress netted a similar set of sensors from China. A Wemos D1 Mini was used as a replacement controller, and with it all buttoned up and programmed it turns out to be slightly cheaper (and more up-to-date) than the original Sparkfun station.

All of the parts and code for this new station are available on [\[Tysonpower\]’s Github page](https://gitlab.com/Tynet.eu/esp8266-thingsboard-weatherstation), and if you want to take a look at a similar station that we’ve featured here before, there’s [one from three years ago that’s also solar-powered](https://hackaday.com/2016/08/17/solar-powered-weather-station-has-the-complete-suite-of-sensors/).
