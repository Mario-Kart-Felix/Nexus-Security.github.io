=========================================================================

WebGLStudio.js is an open-source, browser-based 3D graphics suite. You can edit scenes and materials, design effects and shaders, code behaviours, and share your work - all within a browser using standard web technologies.

Some important WebGLStudio.js features:

*   A full 3D graphics engine ([LiteScene.js](https://github.com/jagenjo/litescene.js)) that supports multiple lights, shadowmaps, realtime reflections, custom materials, postFX, skinning, animation, and much more.
*   An easily extended, component-based system for controlling the rendering pipeline and interaction event hooks
*   An easy to use, what you see is what you get (WYSIWYG) editor that provides a single interface for all coding, graph compositing and timeline features.
*   A graph editor for controlling behaviours and post-processing effects.
*   Supports the [LiteFileSystem.js](https://github.com/jagenjo/litefilesystem.js), a virtual file system that allows drag-and-drop storage of resources on the web, with configurable quotas, users and shared folders.
*   Export and share your work by sending a single link.
