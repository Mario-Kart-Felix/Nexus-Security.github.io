It is no secret that we love Halloween at Adafruit. What better time to show off your awesome [wearable](https://learn.adafruit.com/category/wearables) project or set up a super spooky yard display? Because we can’t hold our excitement to one day, we celebrate #ElectronicHolloween for the whole month of October.

Be sure to follow along this month on the [Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/category/halloween/) as we share tricks and treats with a Halloween theme.

Want to get started on your Halloween projects ASAP? We have a growing assortment of [Halloween products](https://www.adafruit.com/category/307) in the shop, and projects in the [Learning System](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/09/24/the-adafruit-learning-system-has-2000-guides-adafruit-adafruit-thank-you/) ready for your ghoulish inspiration.

If you received an [AdaBox](https://www.adafruit.com/adabox/) lucky number [13](https://www.adafruit.com/adabox013) you already have your hands on the Monster M4sk. Now you can easily add a frightful set of eyes to nearly anything!

Let the Halloween making madness begin!
