[Black Friday](https://www.theverge.com/black-friday) is almost here, and with it, you can expect lots of deals on a range of tech gadgets. Even though it’s almost winter on the East Coast, there’s another kind of product you should consider for your list: electric scooters. Whether you use scooter-sharing services like Lime and Bird, or you (or someone you know) have an eye out for electric scooter deals, now’s a pretty good time to buy one. Wellbots is offering exclusive deals with free shipping and no sales tax (outside of NY state) to readers of _The Verge_. These deals will run through Cyber Monday, or until supplies last.

  

The [Ninebot Segway ES2 Electric Scooter](https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellbots.com%2Fproducts%2Fninebot-by-segway-es2-foldable-segway-scooter&referrer=theverge.com), a popular choice among scooter-sharing companies like Bird and Lime, is currently $469 instead of $599 with the code **ES2VERGE**. The 27.6-pound scooter can reach speeds of 15.5 mph, and you can ride it for 15.5 miles on a single charge. It takes no more than 3.5 hours to charge it back up, and it has rear suspension.

The [Ninebot Segway ES4 Electric Scooter](https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellbots.com%2Fproducts%2Fninebot-by-segway-es4-electric-offroad-scooter&referrer=theverge.com) is discounted to $629 with the code **ES4VERGE**. That’s $140 off of the usual price. This 30.9-pound scooter can go as fast as 18.6 mph, and you can ride it for 28 miles a charge. It takes up to seven hours to charge back up again, and it’s fitted with front and rear suspension for smooth riding.

  

You can get $110 off of the [Ninebot Segway MAX Electric Scooter](https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wellbots.com%2Fproducts%2Fsegway-kickscooter-max-folding-electric-scooter&referrer=theverge.com) with the code **MAXVERGE**, for a price of $689. It can reach the same speed as the ES4, but it can travel further per charge: up to 40.4 miles. As a result, it’s heavier than other scooters on this list, at a weight of 42 pounds, but it charges quicker than the ES4, with a maximum charging time of six hours.

  

**Update November 22nd, 3:27PM ET:** _Wellbots has knocked an extra $10 off of each of these prices since we first published the post._
