The next game from developer Raw Fury (known for the Kingdom series) was revealed during [Microsoft's X019 event](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/x019-inside-xbox-livestream-start-time-and-how-to-/1100-6471272/). It's called West Of Dead and it's playable now through an open beta on Xbox One. It also features the sultry tones of actor Ron Perlman who's the game's narrator and main character named William Mason.

West Of Dead has a distinct painterly art style and it appears as an isometric action game that plays like a fast-paced twin-stick shooter. It's a procedurally generated game where you gun through enemies in a series of hunting grounds in which you have dodge attacks and use cover. The game takes place in Purgatory, Wyoming in the year 1888 and taps into some classic western themes. You can check out in-game screenshots below.

The Microsoft store page describes Purgatory as, "A place of gun smoke and darkness, sin and damnation, wendigos and witches. A shifting, chaotic world that takes its form from the memories, culture or beliefs of the souls who pass through." It continues to outline the premise with, "When a dead man awakens with only the memory of a figure in black, he sets into motion a chain of events that have truly mythic consequences."
