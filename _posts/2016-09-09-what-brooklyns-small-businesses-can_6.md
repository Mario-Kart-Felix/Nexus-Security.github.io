Some quick business insights from watching WeWorks rise and subsequent troubles. Broken down the lessons can be summarized: be inclusive, harbor community and be careful with growth. The author has a similar, much smaller, business; so they have been watching closely.

From Neil Carlson on [Bklyner](https://bklyner.com/what-brooklyns-small-businesses-can-learn-from-weworks-troubles/):

According to a recent study by the Boston Consulting Group, companies with diverse management teams had revenues that were 19 percentage points higher than those of companies with below-average leadership diversity.
