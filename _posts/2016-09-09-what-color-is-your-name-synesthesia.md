> My name is Bernadette, and for as long as I can remember, I’ve had a particular kind of Synesthesia called Grapheme-color synesthesia. This means my brain “sees” letters and numbers as very specific colors.
> 
> For me, this happens the most with names. As a result, when I meet new people, I am terrible at remembering names. I hear the name, but my mind is distracted. In my head, I am calculating the number of letters in the name, and visualizing the colors of each letter. Your name may be Emily, but to me, you’re a bright, happy swath of five letters with an “E” and an “I”. When I meet you again later, I may think your name is Emily or Jille or Ellie. Five letters, with an “I” and an “e.”
> 
> I’ve launched this project to document this phenomenon, and to share with you how I see your name. I hope you enjoy!
