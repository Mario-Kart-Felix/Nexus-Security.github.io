Can you believe that 2019 is almost over? December is right around the corner, and that means streaming services like Hulu have a whole new batch of content coming your way. Hulu--[whose live TV service is getting a price hike soon](https://www.cnet.com/news/hulu-with-live-tv-is-getting-a-10-price-hike-in-december/)\--has released its list for December, and there are more movies, TV shows, and originals to binge-watch to your heart's content. Check it all out below, along with some recommendations.

The majority of Hulu's content drops on the first of the month. If you love the Fast & Furious franchise, then you can enjoy The Fast and the Furious. 2 Fast 2 Furious, and Tokyo Drift on December 1. Sure, the first three movies in this franchise are the weakest--as they were more about driving cars fast and hadn't become the action movies we know now--but Tokyo Drift does have Han in it, and we all love Han. Rest in peace. The fourth movie in the franchise, titled Fast & Furious, arrives later in the month on December 16.

On December 13, the first Transformers spinoff movie, Bumblebee, arrives. It's easily the most-fun of the giant robot series, and in his [review for Bumblebee](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bumblebee-review-totally-an-80s-movie/1100-6463783/), GameSpot's Michael Rougeau said, "Bumblebee hits a perfect tone with a great mix of action, humor, and heart. The soundtrack strikes all the right chords, the action is mostly clear and easy to follow even when two massive robots are rapidly grappling and transforming into various forms, and the characters are instantly relatable, without screenwriter Christina Hodson relying too much on cliches. The homages to Spielberg, Hughes, and other '80s filmmakers may not be subtle, but they are a lot of fun, and Bumblebee pays tribute in smart ways that don't feel out of place or forced."

On December 31, there are plenty of movies leaving the service as well, and there is one you really need to watch again before it leaves. That movie is [Demolition Man](https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/taco-bell-built-its-demolition-man-restaurant-at-c/2900-2149/). It is one of the best sci-fi action movies of the '90s, and you deserve to treat yourself to it. Below, you'll find everything coming and going for Hulu for December, and while you wait for next month to roll around, check out the November release lists for [Hulu](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/coming-to-hulu-in-november-2019-new-movies-tv-and-/1100-6470612/), [Netflix](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/coming-to-netflix-in-november-2019-new-movies-tv-a/1100-6470809/), and [Amazon Prime Video](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-to-amazon-prime-video-for-november-2019-movies/1100-6470599/).
