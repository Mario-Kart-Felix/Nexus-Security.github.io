As 2020 starts, let’s take some time to set goals for CircuitPython in 2020. Just like 2019 (full summary [here](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/01/28/circuitpython-in-2019/)), we’d like everyone in the CircuitPython community to contribute by posting their thoughts to some public place on the Internet.

Here are a few ways to post:

*   a video on YouTube
*   [a post on the CircuitPython forum](https://forums.adafruit.com/posting.php?mode=post&f=60)
*   a blog post on your site
*   a series of Tweets
*   a [Gist on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/)

We want to hear from you. When you post, please add **#CircuitPython2020** and email **circuitpython2020@adafruit.com** to let us know about your post so we can blog it up here.

The post can cover any topic related to CircuitPython. Here are some specific topics you could address:

*   Projects you’d like to build
*   Things you think could be easier
*   Additional community programs
    *   Weekly meeting
*   Core CircuitPython features
    *   Core CPython libraries to add
    *   Additional microcontroller platforms
    *   New boards to support
*   Library improvements
    *   [Blinka](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka)
    *   Additional libraries
    *   Package management
*   Documentation improvements
    *   [Learn guides](https://learn.adafruit.com/category/circuitpython)
    *   [ReadTheDocs](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    *   [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/adafruit)
*   Ecosystem needs
    *   [the newsletter](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/12/17/python-on-microcontrollers-newsletter-sign-up-today-python-circuitpython-microcontrollers-circuitpython-micropython-thepsf-adafruit-2/)
    *   [Awesome list](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-circuitpython)
    *   [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/)
    *   [Adafruit support forum](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewforum.php?f=60)
    *   [Discord channel](https://adafru.it/discord)
*   Tooling enhancements
    *   Github Actions
    *   [the library bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle)
    *   the bootloader

These, of course, are just ideas to start from. Please us know about all ideas you have for CircuitPython.

We’ll read these over the first half of January. After the January 13th CircuitPython weekly we’ll draft an overarching vision post for CircuitPython in 2020 and discuss it in the following meeting.

Thanks to the Rust folks for [the inspiration](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/10/29/A-call-for-blogs-2020.html).
