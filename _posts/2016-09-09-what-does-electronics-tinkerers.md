Ever been in a situation where you’re not sure where to begin building your own electronics workbench or improve your existing one? \[Jeff Glass\] writes in with a blog post as detailed as it is beautifully long, [chronicling each and every part of his own home lab](https://jeff.glass/2019/12/01/electronics-lab-tools/) in order to give us some ideas on how to get one started.

Despite \[Jeff\] using his own workbench tools accrued over 10 years of working in the field as prime example, his guide takes into account that you don’t need the latest and most expensive in order to get working. Affordable examples of the tools presented are suggested, along with plenty of links to follow and what to look for in each one of them. He even goes on and aside to note the lack of affordable versions of bench-top multimeters, seeing how the portable counterparts are so cheap and plentiful in contrast.

However, contrary to \[Jeff\]’s claims, we would argue that there are things you could do without, such as the oscilloscope. And you could use a regular soldering iron instead of a soldering station if you are in a pinch. It just depends on the type of work you’re looking to do, and simpler tools can work just fine, that’s what they’re there for after all. That’s not to say his advice is all bad though, just that every job has different requirements, and he notes just that in the final notes as something to keep in mind when building your own lab.

Lastly, we appreciate having a section dedicated to shop safety and the inclusion of soldering fume extractors in the recommendations. We’ve talked about [the importance of fire safety when working with these tools at home](https://hackaday.com/2016/12/06/hack-safely-fire-safety-in-the-home-shop/) before, and how [soldering is not the only thing that can produce toxic fumes in your shop](https://hackaday.com/2016/09/26/the-healthy-maker-tackling-vapors-fumes-and-heavy-metals/). With [no shortage of great tips](https://hackaday.com/2018/01/29/take-a-deep-breath-thanks-to-a-3d-printed-fume-extractor/) on [how to build your own fume extractors](https://hackaday.com/2016/10/02/a-desk-lamp-solder-fume-extractor/), we hope everybody’s out there hacking safely.
