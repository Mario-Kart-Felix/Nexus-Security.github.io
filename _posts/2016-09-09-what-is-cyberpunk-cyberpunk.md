What is cyberpunk? Good question. Cyberpunk means different things to different people, often depending on what doorway one entered the genre through: sci-fi literature, movies, video or tabletop roleplaying games, hacker culture, or cosplay.

The word cyberpunk was first used to a identify a sci-fi literary genre of the mid-to-late 1980s and early 90s, books by authors like William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Rudy Rucker, Pat Cadigan, Ricahrd Kadrey, and Lew Shiner. The term originally came from a [Bruce Bethke short story](http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/cpunk.htm) published in _Amazing Stories_ in 1983. Bruce was looking for a way to describe a rebellious youth subculture in a high-tech near future, so he tried to think of a compound word that would convey both high-technology and nonconformity. Thus, cyberpunk.

After the publication of William Gibson’s groundbreaking novel, _Neuromancer_, in 1984, well-known sci-fi editor, Gardner Dozois, began using the term to refer to a growing body of near-future sci-fi that shared certain themes, stylistic similarities, and aesthetics.

So, what were some of these styles and themes? In 1992, I wrote a post on [The Well BBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WELL) entitled “Is there a cyberpunk movement?” The post was an attempt at summarizing what cyberpunk was, both as a literary genre, and how its depictions of near-future worlds were imploding onto the present of early 90s high-tech nerd culture (hackers, gamers, industrial/electronic music, tech artists, and cyberpunk zine publishers).

Apparently, the post struck a nerve as it quickly spread beyond the confines of The Well, was dubbed a “cyberpunk manifesto,” and ended up in the pages of _Mondo 2000_ magazine, Rudy Rucker and Mondo 2000’s book [The User’s Guide to the New Edge](https://www.amazon.com/Mondo-2000-Aphrodisiacs-Artificial-Techno-Erotic/dp/0060969288), and as lyrics on Billy Idol’s 1993 record, [Cyberpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_(album)) (but those are all stories to be told here later in the series).

**My own 1991 project, Beyond Cyberpunk! (w/ Peter Sugarman, Mark Frauenfelder, and Jim Leftwich), an attempt at gathering together cyberpunk art, literature, and media and the burgeoning real-world cyberculture into an huge interactive electronic book (created in HyperCard).**

The text of my post is a little dated, but here’s the gist of what I was trying to encapsulate:

\* In a cyberpunk world, global megacorporations are more powerful than governments.  
\* Individual hackers and “high-tech low lifes” can wield disproportionate amounts of power within cyberspace and beyond.  
\* The new “stage” for the human drama has shifted from the “real world” to a virtual one, one inside our networks and our minds. The new frontiers for human society–technology, art, culture, and warfare– have moved into cyberspace.  
\* The “street finds its own uses for things” (Gibson). In a tech-saturated world, high-technology becomes folk technology, is present at every level of society and culture, and ends up being used in ways its creators never could have foreseen.  
\* We are all becoming cyborgs. Our technology daily grows smaller and smaller, ever closer to our person, and soon it will disappear inside of us.  
\* “The future is already here, it’s just not evenly distributed yet” (Gibson) — how rapidly stratifying economic and class divisions are creating a post-human world where the survival advantages of high-technology and bleeding edge science are only available to the rich and powerful.  
\* The world is splintering into a trillion subcultures with their own beliefs, languages, and lifestyles.

In the early 1990s, this was all considered “15 minutes into the future” (as _Max Headroom_ put it), but as you can see, this chillingly describes a lot of the world we’re living inside of now. Which brings us to another hallmark of cyberpunk: dystopianism — dark and broken worlds where individuals and small tribes of like-minded rebels and “blanks” eek out an existence below the radar of reigning corporate authoritarianism.

In this series on _Adafruit_ we’ll be exploring the history and import on cyberpunk. We’ll be surfing the cyberpunk timeline, from its origins in the mid-80s up to the present. We’ll look at the literature, the art, and the media of cyberpunk, the cultures that it helped spawn, how it has impacted real-world technology, hacker and maker culture, and what it got right and what it got wrong in its “speculative fiction” imaginings.

To give you more of an overview, here is a 15-minute mini-doc which paints a decent thumbnail picture of the genre, from then to now, starting with 1982’s groundbreaking film, _Blade Runner_.
