> Quantum teleportation is the result of a quantum phenomenon called “entanglement.” When two (or more) quantum particles are created or interact in a specific way, they can end up dependent on each other, or “entangled,” even when they are separated from each other by long distances.
> 
> In a way, entangled particles behave as if they are aware of how the other particle is behaving. Quantum particles, at any point, are in a quantum state of probabilities, where properties like position, momentum, and spin of the particle are not precisely determined until there is some measurement. For entangled particles, the quantum state of each depends on the quantum state of the other; if one particle is measured and changes state, for example, the other particle’s state will change accordingly.
