> …Feels like we kinda hacked the matrix by releasing our Mr. Puppet video. Pretty quickly after we dropped the video, angels, VCs, studios, & creators started flooding our inbox to take meetings & flapping their checkbooks at us.

Excellent, honest article about raising funds in a unique way, it was refreshing to read. A few specific things I really liked 1) [Thinkco](https://thinko.com/) used one of my favorite “org charts” from Disney, I added bigger versions below. and 2) Thinkco used Adafruit stuff for their prototypes and more ([here’s our post on that](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/01/12/digital-puppets-using-ar-augmented-reality-some-apps-companies-and-14-ish-years-of-trying-things-2020cv_inc-thinkoco-creativecloud-characteranimator-adafruit-circuitplayground/)). Real hardware and software was used to [do the meetings](https://twitter.com/pasql/status/1220455822217695233) using Mr. Puppet for the VCs to see what Thinkco is all about. 3) They are New York based. The Bay Area gets a lot of the focus and attention around start ups, there are a lot of cool NY software and hardware (and both!) start ups, Thinkco is one of them.
