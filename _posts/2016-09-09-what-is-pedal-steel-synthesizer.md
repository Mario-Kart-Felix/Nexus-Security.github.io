> Sound Stone are developing a new type of electro-acoustic synthesizer that uses strings instead of oscillators. They say that it’s a sort of hybrid pedal steel/synth, kind of based of an Ondes Martenot or slide theremin and would like to know what you think of it to determine whether it’s something that they should produce commercially.

> “We have recently completed a prototype of our new Pedal Steel Synthesizer instrument. Inspired by the rare Ondes Martenot, our instrument uses the Sound Stone sustainer tech along with a slide bar, pitch bending pedal, delay, and a built-in analog filter. A typical synthesizer uses an oscillator for its source tone, but ours uses strings. This adds lush harmonics and a very human quality to the sound.”
