Microsoft is already working on Windows 10’s 20H1 update. Expected sometime around April 2020, this will likely be Windows 10 version 2003. It’s much bigger than the upcoming [19H2 update](https://www.howtogeek.com/437112/whats-new-in-windows-10s-19h2-update-arriving-fall-2019/) but still feels like a collection of useful improvements.

This post is up-to-date with features included in [Windows Insider](https://www.howtogeek.com/257948/should-you-use-the-windows-10-insider-previews/) builds up to [build 18890](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/09/24/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-18990/), released on September 24, 2019.

More Control Over Optional Updates
----------------------------------

Windows Update automatically installs many updates, but some updates are optional. Now, there’s a new screen that shows all these updates in one place.

Hardware driver updates, big feature updates like 20H1 itself, and monthly non-security quality updates like the [C and D updates](https://www.howtogeek.com/398226/now-windows-10-has-c-b-and-d-updates.-what-is-microsoft-smoking/) will appear here.

To find this screen after updating to 20H1, head to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update > View optional updates. You can then choose which updates you might want to install.

Windows Update will still automatically install many hardware driver updates, but sometimes there are additional updates that may not automatically be installed. In the past, you had to dig through the Device Manager and select a specific device to update. Now, all optional hardware driver updates will appear on this screen. Microsoft [says](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/09/19/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-18985/), “if you’re having a problem one of those optional drivers might help.”

A New Cortana Experience (With Typing)
