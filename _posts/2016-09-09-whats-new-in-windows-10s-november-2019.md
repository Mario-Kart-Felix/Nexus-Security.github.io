Microsoft is now getting Windows 10’s November 2019 Update, codenamed 19H2, ready for release. Also known as Windows 10 version 1909, this will be the smallest, quickest Windows 10 Update yet. It’s practically just a service pack.

We’ve updated this article with the latest features up to Windows Insider [build 18363.418](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/10/10/getting-the-november-2019-update-ready-for-release/), which Microsoft said was likely the final build on October 10, 2019.

A “Less Disruptive Update” With Fewer Changes
---------------------------------------------

Microsoft’s John Cable [explains](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/07/01/evolving-windows-10-servicing-and-quality-the-next-steps) that this update “will be a scoped set of features for select performance improvements, enterprise features, and quality enhancements.” In other words, expect a select set of bug fixes, performance tweaks, and a handful of business features.

If you’re sick of big Windows 10 updates every six months, Windows 10’s November 2019 Update (19H2) is the update for you! Installing this update will be more like installing a standard cumulative update like the updates that arrive on Patch Tuesday. It should be a small download with a fast installation process—no long reboot and purging of old Windows installations necessary.

Computers with the [May 2019 Update](https://www.howtogeek.com/402569/everything-new-in-windows-10s-april-2019-update/) (also known as 19H1) installed will get a small patch via Windows Update and quickly update themselves to the November 2019 Update (19H2.) This will likely arrive sometime in November 2019, as the name suggests.

With [Windows 7’s end of life looming on January 14, 2020](https://www.howtogeek.com/408556/how-to-avoid-windows-7s-end-of-support-nags/), Microsoft clearly wants to avoid a repeat of last year’s buggy [October 2018 Update](https://www.howtogeek.com/353165/whats-new-in-windows-10s-redstone-5-update-available-fall-2018/).

It’s already out there and being tested. As of [September 5](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/08/26/testing-the-throttled-delivery-approach-for-19h2/), Microsoft says every Windows Insider in the “Release Preview” ring has been offered Windows 10 version 1909. A year ago, Windows 10’s October 2018 Update was released without any testing in the Release Preview ring at all. On October 10, Microsoft said Windows Insiders in the Release Preview ring already had what Microsoft expects is the final build.
