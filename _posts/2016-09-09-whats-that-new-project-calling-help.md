Know someone who loves electronics but doesn’t know the difference between an [XBee](https://www.adafruit.com/category/29), a [soldering iron](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=soldering%20iron), and a [SMA to uFL/u.FL/IPX/IPEX RF Adapter Cable](http://www.adafruit.com/products/851)? Want to buy the perfect gift but don’t know whether your Maker friend is a [BeagleBone](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1996) fan or a [Rasp Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/products/3055) devotee?
