![](https://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/WhatsApp-logo.jpg) Back in 2017, WhatsApp announced that it will continue to support Android 2.3 till 2020 and earlier this year, the company confirmed that it will stop support for Windows Phone at end of 2019. Now, WhatsApp has announced that it will not support iOS 8.0 and older, Android 2.3.7 and older from February 2020. WhatsApp in its blog updated the support for other operating systems wherein the company said it will provide support for devices running Android running OS 4.0.3 and above, iPhone running iOS 9 and above, and select phones running KaiOS 2.5.1 and above, including JioPhone and JioPhone 2. If your device is running iOS 8 and older, and Android 2.3.7 and older, WhatsApp will stop working from February 1, 2020. WhatsApp in a statement said: On iOS 8, you can no longer create new accounts or reverify existing accounts. For the best experience, we recommend you use the latest version of iOS available for your phone. We don't explicitly restrict the use of jailbroken or unlocked devices. However, because these modifications might affect the functionality of your device, we can't provide support for devices using modified versions of the iPhone's operating system. Source
