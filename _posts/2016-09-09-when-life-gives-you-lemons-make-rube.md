When life gives you lemons, you make lemonade. At least that’s what the \[Sprice Machines\] thought when they decided to turn a house into the set of a 9-minute long [Rube Goldberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av07QiqmsoA) machine to make lemonade. (Video embedded below.) The complex chain reactions runs across multiple rooms, using everyday objects like brooms and even a vibrating smartphone to transfer energy across the complex contraption.

While the team professionally builds Rube Goldberg machines for clients, the Lemonade Machine looks surprisingly organic, like something a family might decide to do for fun over a long weekend (although there area few moments that make you question just how they were able to perfectly time every sequence in the chain reaction). Even though the actual lemonade making only takes up a small fraction of the machine, watching marble runs, weights dashing across a clothesline, and random household items repurposed into energy transfer mechanisms is really entertaining.

The \[[Sprice Machines](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSprice17/videos)\] have been making Rube Goldberg machines for quite some time, posting the videos of their final runs on YouTube. Other builders for the Lemonade Machine included \[[Hevesh5](https://www.youtube.com/user/Hevesh5)\], \[[DrComplicated](https://www.youtube.com/user/DrComplicated)\], \[[DoodleChaos](https://www.youtube.com/user/DoodleChaos)\], \[[TheInvention11](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheInvention11)\], \[[5MadMovieMakers](https://www.youtube.com/user/5MadMovieMakers)\], and \[[SmileyPeaceFun](https://www.youtube.com/user/smileypeacefun)\].
