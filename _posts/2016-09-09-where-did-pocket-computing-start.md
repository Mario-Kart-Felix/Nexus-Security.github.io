A smartphone in 2019 is an essential piece of everyday equipment. Many of you are probably reading this page on one, and it will pack a very significant quantity of computing power into your hand. Pocket computing has a long history stretching back decades before the mass adoption of smartphones though, and Paleotronic [has an interesting retrospective of that earlier history](https://paleotronic.com/2019/09/28/from-pocket-computers-to-palmtops-an-early-history-of-mobile-telecomputing/).

The piece starts with the Radio Shack PC-1, a rebadged Sharp with a calculator-style keyboard and a one-line alphanumeric LCD display, then continues through the legendary TRS-80 Model 100 to the era of the palmtop. It’s a difficult subject to cover in its entirety as there are so many milestones on the pocket computing path, but it’s an interesting read nevertheless as it successfully evokes the era when a 300 Baud connection via an acoustic coupler was a big deal. We might for example have mentioned the Atari Portfolio if only for its use by a young John Connor [to scam an ATM in _Terminator 2_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB82FNPoiPM), and as any grizzled old sysadmin will tell you, there was a time when owning [a Nokia Communicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_9000_Communicator) might just save your bacon.

Of the classic pocket computing devices mentioned, only one has received significant coverage here. The TRS-80 model 100 still has a huge following, and among quite a few hacks featuring it we’ve seen one brought into the smartphone age by [getting the ability to make a cellular connection](https://hackaday.com/2018/01/04/trs-80-model-100-goes-cellular/).
