Things are a bit quiet this week in [Destiny 2](https://www.gamespot.com/destiny-2/). There have been several new Exotic weapons added to the game--[Xenophage](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-how-to-start-the-exotic-xenophage-weapon/1100-6471033/), [Deathbringer](https://www.gamespot.com/videos/destiny-2-shadowkeep-deathbringer-exotic-guide/2300-6451197/), [Divinity](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-divinity-exotic-weapon-guide-how-to-earn/1100-6470434/), and [Leviathan's Breath](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-how-to-complete-make-bows-not-war-exotic/1100-6470703/)\--but right now, we're between events in the Season of the Undying. That's okay, though: Xur is back for the weekend, and he's got a few Exotics for you to pick up if you're all done hunting down all the new ones from this season. Here's where you can find Xur and what he's offering for your Exotic collection this week.

Xur Location
------------

To find Xur this week, you'll want to travel to Io. Spawn in at the Giant's Scar transmat zone and head northeast through the archway, then northwest to the edge of the area. You'll find Xur hanging out in a dark cave.

What Is Xur Selling?
--------------------

There's not much of note in Xur's haul this week. The weapon he sports is Riskrunner, a solid Year One SMG option to have in your arsenal, especially with [nerfs on their way next season for The Recluse](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-best-gun-is-getting-nerfed-again/1100-6471470/). He also has one Year Two Exotic this week in Ophidia Spathe, a piece of chest armor for Hunters.

If Xur's wares aren't compelling, you can always roll the dice on the expensive Fated Engram he brings with him. This gives you a single Exotic from the limited pool of ones you haven't already earned, for the price of 97 Legendary shards. If there's something you're missing from your collection, it's a good deal, but be sure to purchase it on the character who's missing the Exotic, and note that you can only get one per week, so choose wisely which of your characters makes the buy. If you're a PC or Xbox One player taking advantage of cross-save, you can now [potentially get Wavesplitter](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-ps4-exclusive-gun-is-finally-available-/1100-6469337/) from the Fated Engram as well.

### Xur Item Lineup (Nov. 15-19)

*   Riskrunner (Exotic submachine gun)
*   Mask of the Quiet One (Exotic Titan helmet)
*   Skull of the Dire Ahamkara (Exotic Warlock helmet)
*   Ophidia Spathe (Exotic Hunter chest armor)

### **Riskrunner**

[![No Caption Provided](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/3604906-destiny%202_20191115090522.jpg)](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1581/15811374/3604906-destiny%202_20191115090522.jpg)

In any situation in which you need to kill a lot of enemies fast--particularly Fallen enemies--Riskrunner is the gun for the job. The SMG Arc Conductor perk causes it to get overloaded by Arc damage you take from incoming fire, making it more powerful while giving you a shield that resists additional Arc damage. While Arc Conductor is running, there's a chance your Riskrunner shots will create chain lightning between enemies and return ammo to the gun. Thus, while you're under fire from Arc weapons, Riskrunner becomes a lightning-spraying bullet hose that can keep you alive.

### **Mask of the Quiet One (Titan)**

[![No Caption Provided](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/3604907-destiny%202_20191115090601.jpg)](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1581/15811374/3604907-destiny%202_20191115090601.jpg)

For Titans, Xur has the Mask of the Quiet One, which gives you bonuses whenever you're hurt. Taking damage gives you ability energy for your grenades, barriers, and melee strikes. If you take critical damage, kills you score can regain maximum health, making it a great Exotic to take into tough situations or the Crucible to help you turn the tides of battle.

**Stats:**

*   Mobility: 6
*   Resilience: 8
*   Recovery: 10
*   Discipline: 6
*   Intellect: 6
*   Strength: 12
*   Total: 48

### **Skull of Dire Ahamkara (Warlock)**

[![No Caption Provided](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/3604908-destiny%202_20191115091958.jpg)](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1581/15811374/3604908-destiny%202_20191115091958.jpg)

A Warlock Exotic favorite, the Skull of Dire Ahamkara used to be a must-have whenever you were running Nova Bomb--but despite some recent nerfs, it's still a highly useful helmet. When using your Nova Bomb, the helmet makes you more resistant to damage, which helps make sure you can get your Super fired even under fire in the Crucible. Landing kills with the Nova Bomb returns Super energy so you can get it back faster, which is very handy in PvE situations.

**Stats:**

*   Mobility: 10
*   Resilience: 3
*   Recovery: 11
*   Discipline: 22
*   Intellect: 2
*   Strength: 2
*   Total: 50

### **Ophidia Spathe (Hunter)**

[![No Caption Provided](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/3604909-destiny%202_20191115092011.jpg)](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1581/15811374/3604909-destiny%202_20191115092011.jpg)

The only Year Two Exotic in Xur's bag this week is for Hunters: Ophidia Spathe. This simple but effective Exotic chest armor gives you two throwing knives per melee charge instead of just one. Paired with the middle tree of the Gunslinger class, Ophidia Spathe can be highly effective, allowing you to use melee attacks to activate the Playing With Fire perk again and again for super-fast melee recharges.

**Stats:**

*   Mobility: 12
*   Resilience: 6
*   Recovery: 7
*   Discipline: 6
*   Intellect: 2
*   Strength: 16
*   Total: 49
