Whenever you need to add custom code to your WordPress site, the typical recommendation is to put it in the theme’s functions.php file. I don’t like doing that as it’s easy to forget to copy-paste that code to the new theme when it’s time to a refresh.

Moreover, if done in that manner, you don’t have the ability to switch on or off certain functions.

The solution for me has been the following plugins:

[Pluginception](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pluginception/) – Lets you create plugins from within the WordPress dashboard. This is useful when I just want to create one plugin to dump all the custom functionality into and have it protected whenever I change themes.

[Code Snippets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/) – An excellent plugin that lets you create snippets of code as functions that can be switched on or off at will, in the same way as you would with normal plugins.

Do you like these solutions?
