When I lived in Vancouver, [I was enthusiastic about SkyTrain](https://pedestrianobservations.com/2013/02/18/skytrain-and-ubc/), which combined high service levels with relatively low construction costs. At the time, the budget for the 12-kilometer Broadway subway from VCC-Clark to UBC was $3 billion (all figures are in Canadian dollars, so subtract 20% for US PPP equivalents). The cost per km was average for a non-English-speaking country, and very low for an English-speaking one, and the corridor has high population and job density. With a ridership projection of 350,000, it was by a large margin North America’s most cost-effective rail extension.

Since then, costs have sharply risen. TransLink lost its referendum and had to scramble for funding, which it got from the new Trudeau administration – but the money was only sufficient to build half the line, between VCC-Clark and Arbutus. With the [latest cost overrun](https://globalnews.ca/news/4177197/broadway-subway-line-costs-grow/), the budget is now $2.83 billion for 5.6 km: **C$500 million per kilometer**. This is [barely below average for a North American subway](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/01/why-its-so-expensive-to-build-urban-rail-in-the-us/551408/), and very high for a Continental European one. I tried reaching out to TransLink before the overrun was announced, trying to understand how it was building subways for less money than the rest of North America, but while the agency knew who I am and what I was querying, it didn’t respond; now I know why.

Outside Vancouver, costs are high as well. In Toronto, there are several subway projects recently built or proposed, all expensive.

The least expensive is the Vaughan extension of the Yonge-University-Spadina Line. It opened last year, after a two-year delay, [at the cost of $3.2 billion for 8.6 km](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/transportation/2017/12/15/trudeau-wynne-tory-on-hand-to-cut-ribbon-on-32-billion-subway-extension.html), or **C$370 million per** **kilometer**. Andy Byford, then the chair of the Toronto Transit Commission, now New York City Transit chief, was credited with limiting the cost overruns after problems began. The line is an outward extension into low-density suburbia, and construction has no reason to be difficult. The source also cites the expected ridership: 24 million per year by 2020, or about 80,000 per weekday, for a total of $40,000 per rider, a high though not outrageous figure.

More expensive is the Scarborough subway. [Toronto has an above-ground rapid transit line connecting Scarborough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_3_Scarborough) with Kennedy on the Bloor-Danforth Line, using the same technology as SkyTrain but with a driver. But unlike Vancouver, Toronto is unhappy with the technology and has wanted to replace the entire line. Originally the plan was to replace it with light rail, but subsequently the plans have changed to a subway. The current plan is to build a 6.4-km nonstop extension of the Bloor-Danforth Line, [which would cost $3.35 billion](https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2017/02/28/cost-of-scarborough-subway-extension-rises-to-335b.html), or **C$520 million per kilometer**. While this is still slightly below average by American standards, [the dominant factor for construction costs in New York is the stations](https://pedestrianobservations.com/2018/01/27/construction-costs-metro-stations/), which means a long subway tunnel with just one new station should be cheap. At the per-item costs of Paris, the line should cost US$1.07 billion, or about C$1.35 billion. At those of Second Avenue Subway, it should cost US$3.3 billion, or about C$4.1 billion. In other words, Toronto is building a subway for almost the same costs as New York, taking station spacing into account, through much lower-density areas than the Upper East Side.

Finally, Toronto has long-term plans for a [Downtown Relief Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_Line_(Toronto)), providing service to the CBD without using the Yonge-University-Spadina Line. The estimated cost in 2016 dollars is $4-4.4 billion ([source](https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2016/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-94624.pdf), PDF-p. 31), but this assumes faster-than-inflation cost escalation already, and adjusted only for inflation this is higher, about $5-5.5 billion. Per PDF-p. 15 the line would have 6.25-6.7 km of tunnel, for a total cost of about **C$800 million per** **kilometer**. The DRL is planned to go under older subways and serve Downtown Toronto, contributing to its higher cost, but the stations are to be constructed cut-and-cover. Despite using cheap construction methods, Toronto is thus about to build an extremely expensive subway.

While I’ve drawn a distinction between costs in English- and non-English-speaking countries, or between common and civil law countries Montreal’s costs are solidly common law Anglophone even though Quebec is Francophone and uses civil law. [A 5.8 km extension of the Blue Line is budgeted at $3.9 billion](http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-metro-green-light-for-blue-line-extension), a total of **C$670 million per kilometer**. The Blue Line is circumferential, and the extension would extend it further out, but the residential areas served are fairly dense, around 10,000 people per square kilometer on adjacent census tracts.

The last case is Ottawa, where costs are less clear. Ottawa is replacing its BRT line with light rail, which includes a short city center tunnel, called the Confederation Line. [The cost is $2.1 billion and the length of the line is 12.5 km, of which 2.5 is in tunnel](https://www.aecom.com/projects/ottawa-light-rail/) and the rest is on the surface. The overall project is more expensive, at [$3.6 billion](http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/reevely-new-3-6b-cost-for-ottawas-rail-plans-makes-provincial-funding-deal-urgent), but that includes related works on other lines. I don’t know the portion of the Confederation Line’s cost that’s attributed to the tunnel, so any estimate for tunneling cost has to rely on estimates for the underground premium over surface transit. In Vancouver the original estimate for Broadway rail had a 2.5:1 premium, which would make the cost of the tunnel $320 million per km; however, a more common premium is 6:1, which would raise the cost of the tunnel to $500 million per km.

I don’t know why Canada is so expensive; I’m less familiar with the details of its subway extensions than I am with those of either the US or the UK. The fact that Toronto manages to have very high construction costs even while using cheap methods (cut-and-cover stations, or long nonstop segments) is worrying, since it casts doubt on the ability of high-cost cities to rein in expenses by using cut-and-cover stations rather than mining.

Moreover, the social reasons leading to degradation of civil service in the US are less relevant to Canada. There is less [hyperlocal empowerment](https://pedestrianobservations.com/2018/02/02/civil-service-racism-and-cost-control/) than in the US and stronger provinces relative to both the federal government and municipalities. Anecdotally I have also found Canadians less geographically solipsistic than Americans. If I had to guess I would say that Canadians look to the US as a best practices model, just as Americans in various cities do to other American (and sometimes Canadian) cities, and if they look at foreign models they look at the UK. Montreal used Paris as a model when it first built its Metro, but more recently its ideas about using France as a model have devolved into [no-bid contracts](http://www.cat-bus.com/2010/10/montreal-metro-cars-bombardier-wins-contract-taxpayers-loose/).
