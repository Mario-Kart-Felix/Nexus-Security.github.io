We’ve all been taught to believe that was an RGB source such as a NeoPixel or the RGB pixels on your computer monitor or flatscreen TV you can make any color you want. But it turns out that our concept of “Brown” is a different thing. It all depends on context. In this fascinating video from [Technology Connections](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy0tKL1T7wFoYcxCe0xjN6Q) they explained that Brown is actually a human construct that is not among “the colors of the rainbow” and is virtually impossible to create with RGB LED such as a NeoPixel.
