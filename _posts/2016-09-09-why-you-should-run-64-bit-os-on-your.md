> The Rpi4 comes with a quad core ARM Cortex A72, up to 4 GB of RAM and a gigabit ethernet port, at a very low price of 35 $.  
> Raspberry provides Raspbian (a Debian derivative), an already ready distro for their products, so I put it on an sd card to boot it quickly.  
> I was looking at the syslog and I noticed that, uh, both the kernel and the whole userland are compiled as armv7, which means 32 bit ARM.
> 
> I know for sure that the RPi4 is 64 bit capable, so I refused to run a 32 bit OS on it. I get another sd card and I installed Debian on it. A lean and mean Debian compiled as aarch64, which means 64 bit ARM.  
> As soon as the 64 bit OS booted, I was curious to know how much it performs better than the 32 bit one, so I did some tests.
