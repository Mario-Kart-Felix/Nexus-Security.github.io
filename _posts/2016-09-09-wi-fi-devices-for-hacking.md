You can easily find lists of chipsets that support packet injection mode on many websites and forums in Internet, but we would recommend you first get familiar with the manuals written by the [](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/null)Aircrack-ng team at their website:

*   [http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compatible\_cards](http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compatible_cards)
*   [http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compatibility\_drivers](http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compatibility_drivers)

[](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/null)In our experience, the most popular suitable chipsets are as follows:

*   Atheros AR9271
*   Ralink RT3070
*   Ralink RT3572
*   Realtek 8187L

[](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/null)If you don't want to spend time on comparing various Wi-Fi interfaces and their parameters, we can recommend our favorites from the company Alpha Network:

*   Alfa AWUS 036 H on RTL8187 chipset
*   Alfa AWUS 036 NHR (v.2) on RTL8188RU chipset

[](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/null)TP-Link TP-WN722N is a very good USB dongle interface. You can see all those three interfaces in the following image:

Our "workhorses" for Wi-Fi pentesting

If you already [](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/null)[](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/null)have a Wi-Fi interface and you are not sure if it supports the packet injection mode, you can test it with the Aircrack-ng suite [](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/null)using the following manual:
