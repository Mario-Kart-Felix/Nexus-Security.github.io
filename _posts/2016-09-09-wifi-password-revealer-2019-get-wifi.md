NOTE #1: This is NOT Wi-Fi password sniffer or stealer. It will only show your saved Wi-Fi passwords (which you have entered in the past).

  

NOTE #2: Administrator rights are required on your PC in order to decrypt stored passwords.

  

NOTE #3: For Windows XP and 2003 Server users. your passwords will be recovered as 64 HEX digits, and not exact password which you have entered. This is NOT a bug. Windows XP automatically converts them into this form, and it can't be converted back. But you can still use this HEX digits instead of real password in order to connect to your wireless network.
