The launch of a major Windows 10 update isn't the end of a process — it's really just the beginning. As soon as one of Microsoft's twice-yearly feature updates is released, the company quickly gets to work on improving it by fixing bugs, releasing security patches, and occasionally adding new features.

Here we've summarized what you need to know about every Windows 10 update being released to the public. First come updates to the currently shipping version of Windows 10 — version 1909, known as the November 2019 Update — with the most recent updates on top.

(Note that Microsoft has not yet begun actively pushing 1909 to users. You can [seek out and install the release](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3453277/microsofts-windows-10-november-2019-update-goes-live.html) on your PC, but why rush things? In fact, we recommend [keeping 1909 off your machine](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3232632/how-to-block-the-windows-10-november-2019-update-version-1909-from-installing.html) for now to avoid any bugs that may crop up with the new release.)
