Thanks to [@dosnostalgic](https://twitter.com/dosnostalgic) on Twitter posting about [eSheep](https://adrianotiger.github.io/desktopPet//Pets/esheep64/), an open source program by Adriano Petrucci which recreates the Windows Desktop Pets from the 1990s.

> If you had a lot of them on the desktopâ€¦ welcome to this page!  
> This project gives you the possibility to add a pet to your desktop.

This pet can fall down up to the taskbar and is able to detect windows on your desktop. In this way, this pet is able to walk, run, etc around your working screen area (also on multiscreens).

The project is on GitHub and available for Windows (7 to 10), as a Win10 App, for webpages (Javascript), and has tools to create your own pets (toasters anyone??).
