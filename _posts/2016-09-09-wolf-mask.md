------------------------------------------------------

> My 7 year old wanted to be the big bad wolf for Halloween, so I took @Sewfiart Wolf Head design and used Meshmixer to create a custom mask for him. Using a scanned head and some dimensions I took from his head, I used it to create a mask that would fit his head.
> 
> The 3d print was printed on an Ultimaker S5, using Ultimaker Black TPU and Ultimaker Breakaway.
> 
> We also placed some electronics inside the head so the eye’s would light up.

Every Thursday is [#3dthursday](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) here at Adafruit! The DIY 3D printing community has passion and dedication for making solid objects from digital models. Recently, we have noticed electronics projects integrated with 3D printed enclosures, brackets, and sculptures, so each Thursday we celebrate and highlight these bold pioneers!

Have you considered building a 3D project around an [Arduino](http://www.adafruit.com/category/17) or other microcontroller? How about printing a bracket to mount your [Raspberry Pi](http://www.adafruit.com/category/105) to the back of your HD monitor? And don’t forget the countless [LED projects](http://www.adafruit.com/category/37) that are possible when you are modeling your projects in 3D!

The [Adafruit Learning System](http://learn.adafruit.com) has dozens of great tools to get you well on your way to creating incredible works of engineering, interactive art, and design with your 3D printer! If you’ve made a cool project that combines 3D printing and electronics, be sure to let us know, and we’ll [feature](http://www.adafruit.com/blog/category/3d-printing/) it here!
