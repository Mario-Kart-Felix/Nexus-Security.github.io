DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser 5.41.0 APK For Android

At DuckDuckGo, we believe that the internet should not be so scary and that the privacy you deserve online should be as simple as closing the blinds.  
**Characteristics:**  
\* Escape Advertising Tracker Networks - Our privacy protection will block any hidden third-party trackers we can find, exposing the main advertising networks that follow you over time, so you can follow who is trying to follow you.  
\* Increase protection against encryption - We force sites to use an encrypted connection when available, thereby protecting your data from prying eyes, such as ISPs.  
\* Private research - You share your most personal information with your search engine, such as your financial, medical and political questions. What you're looking for is your own business, that's why DuckDuckGo research isn't following you. Already.  
\* Decode privacy policies - We have partnered with unread terms of service to include their scores and labels for terms of service and website privacy policies, if applicable.
