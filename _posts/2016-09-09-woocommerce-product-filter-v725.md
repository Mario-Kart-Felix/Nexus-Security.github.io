![](https://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/OPPO-Find-X2-Q1-2020.jpg) It was back in December when we learnt at the Qualcomm Summit that OPPO would announce its Find X2 smartphone sometime in Q1 2020. Now  details have surfaces showing the Find X2's screen that will be a Samsung OLED curved display. The screen size is reported to be 6.5-inches with a resolution of 3168x1440 pixels, becoming OPPO's highest quality screen till date. For refresh rate, it is said to feature a 120Hz refresh rate screen at QHD+ resolution that is sure to drain the battery much faster. It will be powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 865 with the Snapdragon X55 5G for 5G capabilities. Charging will also be one of its fastest with a 65W wired charger, same as Reno Ace. In the camera department, it looks like the OPPO Find X2 will not come with an under screen front camera as the technology does not seem good enough. However, for the rear camera, OPPO will outfit the phone with Sony's new sensor with the all Pixel Omni-directional PDAF technology, which will improve the focusing speed. Source
