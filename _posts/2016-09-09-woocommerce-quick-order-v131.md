![](https://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Xiaomi-Mi-A3-White_fonearena-18-1024x623.jpg) Xiaomi introduced the Android One series of smartphones in collaboration with Google back in September 2017, the Android One program guarantees a couple of Android version updates with regular security patch updates. Xiaomi has been releasing a new Android One device with a focus on cameras and design every year since 2017, and as a result, we have Mi A1, Mi A2, and Mi A3 under the Android One program from Xiaomi. Xiaomi launched the Mi A3 in India back in August and said it will be amongst the first devices to receive Android 10 update. Its been more than 4 months since Android 10 was released but Xiaomi's Mi A3 which is an Android One device is yet to receive the Android 10 update. To remind, the company has already rolled out Android 10 based MIUI update to Redmi K20 Pro, Redmi K20, Mi 9 and Mi 8. Some smartphones such as Redmi Note 8 Pro, Mi MIX 3, Mi 9 SE, Mi 8 SE and Redmi Note 7 have already started receiving Android 10 based MIUI update in China. Thanks for your excitement and patience. Glad to announce the update will be out in mid February for Mi A3. — Mi India #108MP ...
