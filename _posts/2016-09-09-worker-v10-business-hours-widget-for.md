Vivo has taken the Indian budget segment by storm with its [U- and Z-series](https://beebom.com/latest-vivo-u20-sports-snapdragon-675-5000mah-battery/) but it’s now looking to further its assault on the mid-range segment with the Vivo V17. The company has launched the Vivo V17 today at a launch event in New Delhi.  

The Chinese giant has made a point to stand out from its competitors, first with the dual pop-up selfie camera in the [Vivo V17 Pro](https://beebom.com/vivo-v17-pro-launched-price-specs-features/) and now with a tiny punch-hole and rectangular rear-camera module on the Vivo V17. There’s also a powerful Snapdragon chipset in tow, so let’s check out the complete specifications:  

Vivo V17: Specs and Features
----------------------------

  

Starting off with the design, Vivo V17 features a plastic build, but it looks and feels a lot like glass. It comes in two stunning color variants — Midnight Ocean and Glacier Ice. We have the Glacier Ice variant with us and it looks amazing. It sports a rectangular camera bump, which is expected to become a standard in 2020, as well.

Vivo V17 features a **6.44-inch Full-HD+ E3 Super AMOLED display** with the trendy punch-hole design. It boasts a 20:9 aspect ratio, 2400 x 1080p resolution, and 91.38% screen-to-body ratio. Since it’s an AMOLED panel, Vivo V17 comes with **an in-display fingerprint sensor** instead of a physical one.  

> Vivo V17 features only a miniature 2.98mm selfie punch-hole design. Vivo boasts it to be the world’s tiniest punch-hole smartphone.

  

Under the hood, it’s the **Snapdragon 675 chipset** that runs the show. It’s paired with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of onboard storage, expandable up to 256GB via the dedicated microSD card slot onboard. Vivo V17 **runs Android 9 Pie-based FunTouchOS 9.2** in December – almost 4 months after Android 10 was made official. But we can expect the company to take the wraps off [Android 10-based JoviOS](https://beebom.com/jovios-replace-funtouch-os/) at the [Vivo X30 5G launch](https://beebom.com/vivo-x30-launch-date-december-16/) next week.

Moving on, the USP of this phone will have to be the cameras. You get a **quad-camera setup with a 48MP (f/1.8) primary lens**, along with an 8MP (f/2.2) ultra-wide-angle lens with a 120-degree field-of-view, a 2MP (f/2.4) depth sensor, and 2MP (f/2.4) macro lens. This is the same camera setup most phone makers are offering nowadays to boast quad-camera setups. Not much merit here.

  
  

  

The camera software is overflowing with features including the Super Night Mode, Ultra Stable Video, Portrait light effect, Pose Master, and more. There’s also a 32MP selfie lens sitting in the punch-hole. It’s the exact same camera setup that we find on the [recently announced Vivo S5](https://beebom.com/vivo-s5-launch-specs-leaked/) in China.  

Vivo V17 comes equipped with a **4,500mAh battery** with 18W fast charging support. It also packs all essential connectivity options including GPS, Bluetooth 5.0, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, and more.  

Price and Availability
