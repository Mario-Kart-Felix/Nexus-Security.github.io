**Powerful and Easy Yet WordPress File Manager**  
  
We mean it - - the file manager is really. It's basically like managing files on a desktop file browser. For example, you can change the order and levels of file categories with drag-and-drop as well as order files. And everything is saved with AJAX - on the fly. Add new files? All you have to do is drag and drop one or several files. Move or duplicate files? It's a piece if a cake. Drag files or use the buttons to copy, cut, or paste them at the same time.
