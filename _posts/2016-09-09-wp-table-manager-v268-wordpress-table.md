WP Table Manager is the only WordPress table plugin that offers a full spreadsheet interface to manage tables, like in Excel! Create a table, apply some really cool themes and start editing tables right away. As a webmaster you'll enjoy the availability of advanced tools, such as HTML cell editing, table copying, calculation, custom CSS, Excel Import & Export and more. As a user, editing a table is as simple as clicking on cell, and editing data with or without a visual text editor. It's even saved automatically! Usually tables require HTML/CSS knowledge, but this is no longer the case with WP Table manager. It works in the same way both publicly and in the admin side. What's more, full table editing can be done right from your editor.
