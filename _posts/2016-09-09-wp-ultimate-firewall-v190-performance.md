Advanced Firewall protection detects fake, spam and attacking users and protects your website. Indeed, it cannot be blocked by Google or other search engine detections and does not harm your website in terms of SEO. Real-time firewall protection works according to the two options; one is blocking attacks when it is detected and the other one is checking it with reCAPTHCA. You can arrange these settings with Prevention Method System.
