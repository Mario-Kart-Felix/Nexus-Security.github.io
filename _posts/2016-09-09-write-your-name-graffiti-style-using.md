Graffiti is something most people don’t have firsthand experience with. But it still looks cool, and who hasn’t imagined their name being written out in slick graffiti art?

Using some online graffiti generators, you can create graffiti of your name easily. Whether you want to create cool art without committing a crime or just write your name in style, you can do it with these graffiti creators.

1\. [Graffiti Creator](http://www.graffiticreator.net/)
-------------------------------------------------------

This long-time graffiti maker bills itself as “the original” on its site. To get started, pick from one of the several graffiti styles, including Kodiak, Bubbles, Wavy, and Flava.

The site still uses Adobe Flash, so you’ll need to allow it to run in your browser. Enter your text in the bottom-left corner and click **Create** to get a template. Adjust the letter-spacing below this and pick a color from the wheel or RGB sliders.

At the bottom-right, you can apply graphical styles to your graffiti to further customize it. If you want to customize letters individually, click and drag them on the canvas. Above the styles box, you can also select individual letters to apply effects to.

That’s all there is to this graffiti name generator; get as creative as you’d like. There’s no built-in option to save or export your creation, so you’ll need to right-click the canvas and choose **Print** to save it as a PDF or similar. Alternatively, you can take a screenshot of your art.

The creator of this page is a full-time graffiti artist and illustrator whose work has been featured in many products. If you’re looking for more professional graffiti of your name, you can reach out to him for a commission at [CustomGraffiti.net](https://customgraffiti.net/).

Note that Adobe plans to discontinue Flash after 2020, so this app won’t work after that unless it receives an update to use modern technology.

2\. Download or Copy Graffiti Fonts
-----------------------------------

If you don’t want to use a dedicated graffiti creator app, you can download some free graffiti fonts manually and use them in your own projects. You’re sure to find plenty of graffiti-related options on [the best free font sites](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/free-fonts-sites-where-find-them/).

One example is the [Graffiti Fonts collection on Font Meme](https://fontmeme.com/graffiti-fonts/). This collects dozens of fonts from around the site in one easy page. Plus, if you don’t want to download and install a font, you can quickly generate any text you like and copy it.

To do this, enter some text in the first box, then select a font from the dropdown below it. After choosing the font size, you can apply one of the many effects if you want to. To finish up, just pick a color and hit the **Generate** button when ready.

You’ll see a preview of the text appear below. Confirm it looks right, then right-click it and choose **Save image as** to keep a copy of it. Alternatively, right-click and select **Copy** to paste it into an image editor. The **Embed** button provides links to add your creation to your website or link to the image.

3\. [GraffWriter](https://graffwriter.com/graffwriter/create.php)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Here’s an alternate graffiti name maker that’s also easy to use. Enter your text in the top-left corner of the maker, then adjust the size, color, and gradient on the left side. You can even add a background image if you like.

To go deeper, use the controls along the top of the editor. **Effects** lets you add outlines, shadows, blurs, and similar effects. If you’re not feeling too creative, use **Presets** to apply a pre-made theme. Check the available **Fonts** if you don’t like what you’re using.

The major downside of this service is that it doesn’t update your graffiti name in real-time. You’ll need to click the **Submit** button to apply your changes each time. It will also display an error if your item is too large.

When you’re satisfied with your creation, click the **Host this image** button to generate an embed code and image download link. You can save or copy this image wherever you want to use it.

4\. [Graffiter](https://graffiter.com/app/walls)
------------------------------------------------

Thus far, we’ve looked at tools mainly intended as graffiti name generators. But what if you want to create virtual graffiti for the fun of drawing? That’s where Graffiter comes in.

This site lets you pick from a variety of walls to tag. Once you’ve selected one, you can use different drawing tools at the top for certain looks, like smeared or clean. Choose your drawing colors, and even zoom in if you need to.

After you’ve completed your masterpiece, the service lets you upload it to Graffiter.com for other people to see. You can peruse what others have added to get ideas for your own creations.

Graffiter is a fun way to live out drawing on a wall without fear of getting arrested. You’ll be able to make more impressive art if you have a touchscreen device, of course.

How Will You Graffiti Your Name?
--------------------------------

These graffiti creators for names are a perfect way to create a fancy logo for yourself. Whether you want to add them to a website or just mess around for fun, they’re easy to use and paste into other image editors.
