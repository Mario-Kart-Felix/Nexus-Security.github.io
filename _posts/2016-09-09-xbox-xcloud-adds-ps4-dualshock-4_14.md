During its Xbox fan event in London, [X019](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/x019-inside-xbox-livestream-start-time-and-how-to-/1100-6471272/), Microsoft shared more details on its game-streaming service, Project xCloud. One of the biggest new reveals is that Microsoft is adding [numerous more games](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-game-pass-games-announced-some-available-/1100-6471451/) to the service along with support for new controllers, including Sony PlayStation's DualShock 4.

xCloud already supports Xbox One controllers, but the company said it plans to expand to the DualShock 4 from Sony's PS4 and other game pads from peripheral company Razer. It's not exactly clear how DualShock 4 support would work given the button names are completely different.

Microsoft also announced that, in 2020, it plans to add support for xCloud on Windows 10 PCs, as well as devices made by a "broad set of partners." Currently, xCloud only works on Android phones. Another big piece of news is that Microsoft is expanding the network of public testers to, so if you didn't receive an invite to the initial beta, check your email again now. The current xCloud public trial continues to be exclusive to the US, UK, and Korea, however.

Another big piece of xCloud news is that game streaming is also coming to Xbox Game Pass, so subscribers can play games in that catalogue via the cloud on compatible devices.

In 2020, the xCloud preview program will expand to Canada, Japan, India, and Western Europe, though there is no word on support for Australia or other major areas around the globe. Microsoft has said it wants xCloud to eventually reach 2 billion gamers across the world, and it appears it will take a while for that dream to become a reality.

Microsoft also announced it's adding more than 50 additional games to the xCloud preview. These include [Madden NFL 20](https://www.gamespot.com/madden-nfl-20/), [Tekken 7](https://www.gamespot.com/tekken-7/), [Hitman](https://www.gamespot.com/hitman/), [Just Cause 4](https://www.gamespot.com/just-cause-4/), [Borderlands: The Handsome Collection](https://www.gamespot.com/borderlands-the-handsome-collection/), and [Darksiders 3](https://www.gamespot.com/darksiders-iii/), among many others.
