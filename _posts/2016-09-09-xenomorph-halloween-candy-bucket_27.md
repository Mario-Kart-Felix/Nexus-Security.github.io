Why roam around with a boring pumpkin bucket when you can lay eggs in warm human intestines collect delicious candy with a robotic Xenomorph head?

This robotic candy bucket shoots out a small receptacle to retrieve candy and bring it back into [the bucket](https://super7.com/products/alien-superbucket-alien).

Some 3D printing is required to create the linear actuator. Two servo motors controlled by a Circuit Playground Express, coded with MakeCode, power this project.
