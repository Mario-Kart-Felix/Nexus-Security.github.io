A new Android trojan tension has become a headliner after darting upon the detector of several cyber-security firms and disturbing the smartphone users, because of its re-installing peculiarity that has become a headache. The malware was located in March for the first time but it gradually developed to affect the android phones.

Hot as xHelper, it is a unique malware that has been detected by antivirus corporations. xHelper is quite dangerous as it has a self re-install origin, a process that makes it very difficult to eliminate from Android gadgets. The Trojan is said to have corrupted around 45,000 devices. "Every day, 131 different devices are corrupted, whereas, 2,400 devices are being affected every month," says Symantec, a cybersecurity company. Eliminating the xHelper assistance from your Android device is useless as the malware re-establishes itself despite the user completing a factory reset.  
  
In the conclusion of a story, the Trojan provides for popup ads on devices simultaneously beside spams. These popup notices make profits for the bodies responsible for the deed. Also, the trojan-infected android devices are required to install various apps from the Google Play Store, once the damage has been done. The malware secures profit in the scheme of pay-per-download payments, once the application is installed on the android phone.  
  
But it appears that the Trojan does not perform any lethal actions on the device. "xHelper is only confined to interfering popup ads and spams, it doesn't possess any severe threat to the device" claims the reports of Symantec and Malwarebytes. Besides, excluding the xHelper assistance from the Android OS devices won't do any relief as the malware re-fixes itself despite the user restoring the phone to factory reset settings. The matter of concern, though, is the point that android device users have been notified that while xHelper is momentarily only confined to popups, spams, and ads, it can, however, install different applications, which could extend a secondary degree trojan threat that can steal sensitive data such as personal information and banking credentials of the users.
