Xiaomi recently kicked-off its 2020 launch cycle with the [Redmi 8A Dual](https://beebom.com/redmi-8a-dual-launched-india/) and two [Redmi-branded power banks](https://beebom.com/redmi-power-banks-launched-india/). Well, the Chinese giant is hitting the throttle and has teased the launch of a new Mi-branded audio product next week.  

In an official tweet sent out by Xiaomi India, the company revealed its plans to launch **a new audio product in India on 17th February**. The caption reads, _“Time to go big on sound. While you take a guess, do think about where will you #CarryYourSound.”_

The latter half of the caption, along with the silhouette of a speaker’s diaphragm in the video below hints at the arrival of a portable Bluetooth speaker. However, the company could also finally expand into the truly wireless market to compete against the [Realme Buds Air](https://beebom.com/realme-buds-air-launched-india/). It seems unlikely to me because Xiaomi will tackle that market under Redmi’s brand name, launching the [Redmi AirDots](https://beebom.com/how-to-buy-redmi-airdots-india/) (or maybe a second-gen upgrade).  

It’s great to see Xiaomi circling back to expand its audio products lineup, which saw the company add a new [on-ear Bluetooth headset](https://beebom.com/mi-superbass-wireless-headphones-launched-price-availability-specs/) and [neckband earphones](https://beebom.com/mi-neckband-bluetooth-earphones-launched/) in mid-2019. It hasn’t launched a new speaker in a long while, so let’s see what Xiaomi has in store on February 17.
