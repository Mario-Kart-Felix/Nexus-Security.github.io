As the name says, this offers matte finish on the back and the sides offering a battery grip and promises all round protection for the phone since it is made of shock absorbent material. Even the volume keys on the sides are protection so that it can protect the phone from scratches. Inner side of the phone is made of soft material. Similar to protective cases for the K20 series, the bottom part of this case is left open to access the ports easily, and there are holes on the top for the IR sensor and the secondary microphone. You have to remove the case only when you have to remove the SIM tray which is located on the left side of the phone. The Mi Matte Hard Case for the Note 8 Pro comes only in Black color, is priced at Rs. 499 and is available from mi.com.
