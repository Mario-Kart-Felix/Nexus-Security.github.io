After [teasing](https://beebom.com/xiaomi-new-bluetooth-speaker-launch-expected/) the arrival of a new audio product for the past few days, Xiaomi has today launched the _Mi Outdoor Bluetooth speaker_ in India. It’s a tiny and lightweight cuboidal speaker that fits in the palm of your hand. This portable speaker has been **priced at an attractive Rs. 1,399 in India**.  

Mi Outdoor Bluetooth Speaker: Specs and Features
------------------------------------------------

  

One look at Xiaomi’s portable speaker is enough to tell you that it looks like the [Google Home Mini](https://beebom.com/google-home-mini-review/), with the plastic bottom and grey fabric-covered top. The shape of Xiaomi’s speaker may not be the same but it does exude Home Mini vibes.  

Mi Outdoor Bluetooth speaker packs the power and play/pause button on one side and volume rockers on the other. The other two edges include a loop strip to hang or easily carry the speaker and the charging port, as well as AUX port, respectively.

As for the audio department, Xiaomi has baked a 5W speaker in this tiny thing and says that you can expect _“clear, rich, and punchy bass”_ onboard. One of the highlights of this speaker is the **IPx5 water resistance rating**. It supports both Android and iOS devices, along with Bluetooth 5.0 to establish a connection. You can use the built-in microphone to answer calls.  

Xiaomi threw us a [curveball with the teasers](https://twitter.com/XiaomiIndia/status/1228210085354033153), making us think that it will launch a smart speaker today. But that’s not the case. Instead, the Mi Outdoor Bluetooth speaker has a **button to let you easily access the voice assistant** on your smartphone.  

In terms of music playback, the speaker comes backed by a 2,000mAh battery that will enable you to **stream music for up to 20 hours**. Now that’s an impressive battery life claim but we will have to test it ourselves, along with the audio quality, to be the better judge.
