With a 26 percent market share, Chinese handset maker, Xiaomi, continued its dominance in the India smartphone market during the third quarter of 2019. That’s according to the [latest Market Monitor report](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/india-smartphone-shipments-reached-record-high-49-million-units-defying-economic-slowdown-trends-sectors/) from Counterpoint Research, which says smartphone shipments during the quarter reached a record 49 million units despite the slowdown in the overall economy.

Vivo also reached its highest-ever share in the Indian smartphone market, thanks largely to the success of its U10, Z1X, and Z1 Pro smartphones.
