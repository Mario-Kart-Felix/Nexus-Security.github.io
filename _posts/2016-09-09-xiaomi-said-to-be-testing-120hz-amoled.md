![](https://images.fonearena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mi-Note-10-1.jpg) Xiaomi launched K20 Pro (Mi 9T Pro) flagship smartphone this year, and it introduced Mi 9 Pro 5G in China recently, but these feature standard 60Hz display, compared to 90Hz display in OnePlus, Pixel 4 and 120Hz display in ASUS ROG Phone II and Razer Phone 2. Now the news from China is that Xiaomi is working on a new flagship smartphone with 120Hz AMOLED display for 2020. Screenshots that surfaced last month showed 120Hz and 90Hz refresh rate option in setting in the MIUI ROM that is in development, even though there are no phones with that hardware. OnePlus is also said to be working on implementing 120Hz display in its upcoming flagship — OnePlus 8 for next year. It is not clear which flagship Xiaomi phone will feature 120Hz display, but rumors say that it could be Mi MIX 4, since Mi MIX Alpha that was introduced last month is just a concept phone. We should know more details about this in the coming months. Source 1, 2
