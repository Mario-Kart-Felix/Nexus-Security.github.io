The electronic payment service Yandex.Money will re-issue the cards of its customers, the data of which users stored on one of the hacked servers.  
  
Earlier, one of the Telegram channels reported that the attackers took possession of a full dump of the database network of electronic money exchangers. According to the channel, they are trying to sell a dump containing logins, names, addresses, partially decrypted passwords of user ID-wallets, card numbers and their balance for 50 thousand dollars.  
  
According to Yandex Representatives, all information was taken from a third-party server through which users exchanged funds. As a result of verification, Yandex found out that a private website was hacked.  
  
Itâ€™s important to note that scammers will not be able to use payment information, since all transactions require a number of actions confirming the operation.  
  
"All wallet transactions require a payment password, card transactions also require 3Ds confirmation, but in any case, we will reissue all cards whose details have been made public," the company said.  
  
QIWI Technical Director Kirill Ermakov told that the leak does not relate to the compromise of QIWI databases and does not pose a threat to users.  
  
"The data of third-party services that are not related to QIWI were leaked. We take the protection of personal data of our customers very seriously and constantly inform customers that they can not leave their personal data and data to enter your personal account on third-party resources," he said.  
  
Last week, hackers posted information about the sale of data cards of customers of Sberbank. The authors of the announcement stated that their database contains 60 million entries. Initially, the Bank confirmed that the data of 200 customers had leaked, but later Sberbank admitted that the leak affected 5 thousand customers. According to the credit institution, their data is safe. Sberbank found a suspect in the leak, he was an employee of the Bank.
