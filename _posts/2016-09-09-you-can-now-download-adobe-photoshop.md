Adobe has finally released Photoshop for iPad. It may have taken a while to arrive, but Photoshop is finally available on iPadOS a year after it was first announced. Which means you can now download Adobe Photoshop onto your iPad.

In October 2018, Adobe showed off a preview of Photoshop for iPad. The company promised a new UI designed just for tablets, and most of the same features beloved by users of the desktop version. And now, in November 2019, [Photoshop for iPad](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/ipad.html) has arrived.

What to Expect From Adobe Photoshop for iPad
--------------------------------------------

Adobe announced the release of Photoshop for iPad in a post on [the Adobe Blog](https://theblog.adobe.com/creativity-is-everywhere-now-photoshop-is-too-begin-the-journey-of-photoshop-reimagined-for-the-ipad/). Adobe has labelled this Photoshop for iPad Version 1.0, stating that “this is just the beginning of our journey to expand Photoshop to devices”.

At launch, Photoshop for iPad is “focused on compositing, basic retouching, and masking, common tasks and workflows that we know will be useful for most Photoshop users.” The new cloud documents system lets you “open and edit your PSDs anytime, anywhere.”

Photoshop for iPad is “built using the same code base as Photoshop on the desktop.” However, it has been “optimized for pencil and touch on a smaller screen.” The toolbar is on the left, layers are on the right, and everything is automatically saved to the cloud.

This is clearly just a starting point, with Adobe promising to “add more capabilities and workflows as we learn more about how customers use Photoshop on a mobile device.” Features such as rotate canvas, select subject, and refine edge are already on their way.
