Microsoft has released the new Microsoft Edge to the masses. Which means you can download the new Chromium-based Microsoft Edge on Windows and macOS right now. Or you can wait for Microsoft to update you automatically in the coming months.

What Is the New Chromium-Based Microsoft Edge?
----------------------------------------------

The new Microsoft Edge has been rebuilt using Chromium, an open-source project that also powers Google Chrome. It has been in development for a year, with Windows Insiders testing the early versions for several months. And now [it’s ready for general release](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2020/01/15/new-year-new-browser-the-new-microsoft-edge-is-out-of-preview-and-now-available-for-download/).

Microsoft has rebuilt Edge using Chromium to foster better compatibility for all web users and reduce fragmentation for web developers. Microsoft has also committed to helping improve the Chromium engine overall in order to improve the way web browsers work.

How to Download the New Microsoft Edge
--------------------------------------

To download the new Chromium-based Microsoft Edge, go to [the Microsoft Edge site](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge), and download the installer for your device(s). The new Microsoft Edge is available for Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, and Windows 7, plus macOS, Android, and iOS.

Run the installer, and the new Microsoft Edge will either install from scratch or overwrite the previous version of Edge. Launch the new Edge, and choose whether to import your data or start from scratch. You can also configure other settings at this time.

If you would rather not download the new Edge manually, you can wait until Microsoft upgrades you automatically. This will happen on Windows 7 through 10 (even though [Microsoft no longer supports Windows 7](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/microsoft-ends-windows-7-support/)), plus macOS, Android, and iOS.

Sign Up to the Microsoft Edge Insider Channels
----------------------------------------------

While this is a stable release of the new Edge, it’s still a work in progress. Microsoft will continue improving Edge, adding some key features—such as Collections, which lets you organize information from web pages into shareable documents—not currently available.

If you download the new, Chromium-based Microsoft Edge and like what you see, you can sign up to one of [the Microsoft Edge Insider Channels](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/new-microsoft-edge-insider-channels/). Doing so will enable you to test the latest version of Edge before it’s released in the wild.
