Spotify Wants to Make Playlists for Your Pets
---------------------------------------------

According to Spotify, 71 percent of pet owners have played music for their pets, and 80 percent believe their pets like music. This is based on a survey of 5,000 music-streaming pet owners from the US, the UK, Australia, Spain, and Italy.

Upon discovering how mad most pet owners are, Spotify set about creating playlists for pets. So, as outlined on [For the Record](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-01-15/spotify-has-the-pawfect-playlist-for-you-and-your-pet/), Spotify “created a unique experience to help you craft the pawfect algorithmically generated playlist for you and your pet to enjoy together.”

How to Make a Spotify Playlist for Your Pet
-------------------------------------------

1.  Open [the Spotify for Pets microsite](https://pets.byspotify.com/) and sign into your Spotify account.
2.  Pick your pet (only dogs, cats, hamsters, birds, and iguanas are available).
3.  Use the slider to indicate your pet’s personality (**from Relaxed to Energetic**).
4.  Use the slider to indicate your pet’s personality (**from Shy to Friendly**).
5.  Use the slider to indicate your pet’s personality (**from Apathetic to Curious**).
6.  Type in the name of your pet and upload a photo of your pet (optional).
7.  Spotify will sync your pet’s personality with your tastes to create a playlist.

You’ll then be presented with a card revealing a selection of the artists included on the playlist. And you can either click “Listen Now” to open Spotify, or “Share what you just made for your best friend” with others via Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

Spotify’s playlists for pets are “algorithmically created” and “based on your listening habits and your pet’s attributes”. Spotify admits that “music for pets isn’t an exact science,” but assures us that they “consulted with experts in the pet industry”.

If you’re wondering why your goldfish, tarantula, or snake aren’t catered for, according to Spotify, it’s because they don’t have ears. Obviously. As for rabbits, aardvarks, and horses, Spotify has no excuse, but suggests trying a playlist meant for another animal.

How Did Your Pet Respond to Their Spotify Playlist?
---------------------------------------------------

Music playlists for pets are just a bit of fun, and not to be taken too seriously. Still, it would be interesting to hear how your pet reacted to Spotify’s choice of music for them. Unfortunately, [virtual pets that live on your mobile](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-virtual-pet-games-for-mobile/) don’t count. Yet.
