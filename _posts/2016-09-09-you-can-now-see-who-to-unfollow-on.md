In an effort to help you streamline your Instagram, the social network has added categories to Following. This new feature lets you see whose posts you’re seeing often and which accounts you’re interacting with the least. Helping you decide who to unfollow.

It’s Time to Unfollow People on Instagram
-----------------------------------------

When you first start out on Instagram, you tend to follow lots of people. Starting with your friends, then the celebrities and brands you like, and then the people who start following you as you start posting photos and videos. The classic “follow back”.

However, years later, you’re probably following far too many people on Instagram. Some will no longer be active, while others may post content that doesn’t interest you. It’s time to prune the number of people you follow on Instagram, but where to start?

How to Use Instagram’s New Following Categories
-----------------------------------------------

Instagram is giving you the perfect starting point with two new categories you can use to sort through who you’re following. The two categories are **Least Interacted With** and **Most Shown in Feed**, both of which should be pretty self-explanatory.

**Least Interacted With** shows you the accounts you’ve had the least interactions with over the past 90 days. These are the people whose posts you rarely like or comment on. **Most Shown in Feed** shows you which accounts are posting far more than is healthy.

To access these categories, first, **open Instagram** on your phone. Then, **click on your profile** (the human-shaped icon in the bottom-right. Then, **click Following**, and you should see the new **Categories**. Click on one of these to see accounts listed in order.

You can use these to see who may be worth unfollowing. Either because you’re clearly not interested in what they’re posting or because they’re filling up your feed with endless posts. Whatever the reason, you can click **Following** from the list to unfollow them.
