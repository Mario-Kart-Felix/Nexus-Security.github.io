YouTube TV is now available to watch on Amazon Fire TV devices. Google and Amazon were at war for several years, which adversely affected consumers. However, in 2019, the hostilities were called off, and we’re now seeing the fruits of those peace talks.

What Is YouTube TV?
-------------------

At the beginning of 2017, Google launched YouTube TV. YouTube TV being Google’s live TV streaming service. For $50/month, subscribers can gain access to 70+ networks including ABC, CBS, ESPN, AMC, Discovery, Disney, FX, National Geographic, and more.

YouTube TV is one of a slew of [viable alternatives to cable TV](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/live-tv-streaming-services/) now available. But unlike many others, YouTube TV has never been available on Amazon Fire TV devices. Until now. And it’s all thanks to the thawing in relations between Google and Amazon.

How to Watch YouTube TV on Your Fire TV
---------------------------------------

On [the Amazon Fire TV Blog](https://amazonfiretv.blog/can-i-watch-youtube-tv-on-fire-tv-4a95287b26de), Amazon announced that YouTube TV is now available on Fire TV devices. The company implies that this is a response to customer feedback, but the improving relationship between Amazon and Google clearly helped as well.

YouTube TV is now available on most Fire TV devices, including the Fire TV Stick (2nd Gen), Fire TV Stick 4K, Fire TV Cube, Fire TV (2nd and 3rd Gen), and Fire TV Edition smart TVs. YouTube TV is not compatible with the Fire TV Stick (1st Gen) and Fire TV (1st Gen).
