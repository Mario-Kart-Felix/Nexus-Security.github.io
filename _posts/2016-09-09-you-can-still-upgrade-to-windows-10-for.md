Thankfully, you’re in luck—for now. It is still possible to upgrade to Windows 10 for free by using a method that was officially axed in 2018.

Upgrade to Windows 10 for Free
------------------------------

Follow the instructions below to learn how to upgrade to Windows 10 for free:

1.  Head to the [official Windows download website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10).
2.  Look for **Create Windows 10 installation media > Download tool now**.
3.  Click on **Run**.
4.  Select **Upgrade this PC now** (or **Create installation media for another PC** if you want to install Windows 10 on a different machine).
5.  Follow the remain on-screen installation prompts.

Despite being a loophole, there is nothing wrong with upgrading to Windows 10 using this method. You will receive a full and legal Windows 10 license. It will b connected to your Microsoft Account profile.

But remember, we cannot guarantee how long this loophole will remain open. Microsoft could pull the plug at any moment. If you’d rather save yourself some cash, you need to move quickly.

How to Pay For Windows 10 Upgrade
---------------------------------

Even if Microsoft does close the loophole to upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 for free, it will always be possible to upgrade to Windows 10 via the [Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-10-home/d76qx4bznwk4). A Windows 10 license costs a one-off fee $139.

If you want to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, the cost is $199. Windows 10 Pro gives you some extra features, including remote desktop, BitLocker, the ability to create and run virtual machines with Hyper-V, and Azure Active Directory.

Regardless of which package you choose, you can choose to download the installer for your new copy of Windows for either the desktop or a USB stick. Make your choice directly on the Microsoft website. Once the installation app is running, just follow the on-screen instructions.

Lastly, you could hit the shops and upgrade your laptop at the same time. A mid-spec Windows 10 laptop is very reasonably priced. To learn more, check out our list of [the best Windows laptops](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-windows-pc-laptop/).
