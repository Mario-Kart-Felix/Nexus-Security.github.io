By now most readers will be familiar with the Miniware TS100 and TS80 soldering irons, compact and lightweight temperature controlled soldering tools that have set a new standard at the lower-priced end of the decent soldering iron market. We know they have an STM32 processor, a USB interface, and an OLED display, and that there have been a variety of alternative firmwares produced for them.

Take a close look at the TS80, and you’ll find the element connector is rather familiar. It’s a 3.5 mm jack plug, something we’re more used to as an audio connector. Surely audio from a soldering iron would be crazy? Not if you are \[Joric\], who has [created a music player firmware](https://github.com/joric/ts80player) for the little USB-C iron. It’s hardly a _tour de force_ of musical entertainment and it won’t pull away the audiophiles from their reference DACs, but it does at least produce a recognisable _We Wish You A Merry Christmas_ as you’ll see from the video below the break.

Since [the TS100 arrived](https://hackaday.com/2017/07/24/review-ts100-soldering-iron/) a couple of years ago we’ve seen a variety of inventive firmware for it. You may remember \[Joric\]’s previous triumph of a Tetris game for the iron, but our favourite is probably [the TS100 oscilloscope](https://hackaday.com/2017/09/28/part-soldering-iron-part-hand-held-oscilloscope/).

Thanks \[cahbtexhuk\] for the tip.
