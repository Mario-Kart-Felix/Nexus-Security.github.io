YouTube Music now offers personalized playlists, or, as it’s referring to them, personalized mixes. These playlists are designed to mirror your music tastes, providing a blend of songs you already know alongside new releases and undiscovered gems.

From Mixtapes to Personalized Playlists
---------------------------------------

Playlists were already established before streaming services became a thing. Everyone over a certain age will remember making a mixtape for a crush. However, because streaming services know exactly what music you listen to, mixtapes have evolved.

[Spotify has turned playlists into an art form](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/discover-new-music-spotifys-automagic-playlists/), using people’s listening habits to deliver curated playlists pitched perfectly to individual users’ tastes. And now YouTube Music is getting in on the action with its own blend of personalized mixes.

YouTube Music Launches Personalized Mixes
-----------------------------------------

YouTube launched its new personalized mixes on [the Official YouTube Blog](https://youtube.googleblog.com/2019/12/youtube-music-makes-discovery-more.html). The company explains that “these mixes will use your listening history to create a unique experience and guide your music exploration to exciting and fresh destinations week after week.”

The **Discover Mix** is a weekly playlist (that updates every Wednesday) comprising of 50 tracks. These will be a mix of songs by artists you’ve never listened to and deep cuts from artists you’re already familiar with. The idea being you’ll discover new music.

> We just got more personal. Check out our new playlists, mixed for you, only on [#YouTubeMusic](https://twitter.com/hashtag/YouTubeMusic?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) ? [https://t.co/IuDil1Co73](https://t.co/IuDil1Co73) [pic.twitter.com/VESSLvYdgn](https://t.co/VESSLvYdgn)

The **New Release Mix** does exactly what it says on the tin. It’s a playlist packed with new releases by your favorite artists and artists YouTube thinks you’ll enjoy. This playlist will update every Friday (to coincide with the day of the week most releases drop).

**Your Mix** is a playlist packed with songs you’re (almost) guaranteed to like. It will consist mostly of artists and songs you already listen to, but with some artists and songs you don’t know mixed in. YouTube Music will update this regularly.

All Streaming Services Are Copying Spotify
------------------------------------------

You should find these new personalized mixes on a shelf in the YouTube Music app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.music) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/youtube-music/id1017492454), as well as on [youtube.music.com](https://music.youtube.com/). They’re now available globally for all YouTube Music listeners, with YouTube promising more to come in the future.

Spotify deserves the credit for starting this trend of delivering personalized playlists. However, everyone else has since copied Spotify, with [Apple Music](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/apple-music-replay-favorite-songs/), [Tidal](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/tidal-curated-my-mix-playlists/), and [Pandora](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/pandora-spotify-curated-playlists/) all now offering curated playlists designed to mirror your music tastes.
