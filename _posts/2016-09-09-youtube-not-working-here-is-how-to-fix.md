14\. Use a VPN
--------------

  

If YouTube is not working in your school or college then it’s very likely that the website has been restricted by the authority.

15\. Contact your Internet Service Provider
-------------------------------------------

  

If none of the methods worked then your ISP may be at fault. ISPs are responsible for providing internet access, but they can also block access to certain websites from their end. So to resolve the YouTube issue, you should **contact your ISP and ask them to lift the restriction**.
