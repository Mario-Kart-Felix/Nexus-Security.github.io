What Happened With YouTube Rewind 2018?
---------------------------------------

Every year, YouTube publishes a video representing the past 12 months on YouTube. It generally features the biggest YouTubers, viral videos, music videos, and cultural moments that define the year. However, things took a turn for the worse in 2018.

YouTube Rewind 2018 changed things. There was no mention of YouTubers such as PewDiePie and Shane Dawson. Instead, Will Smith and Ninja set the tone for a trawl through mainstream fare. Which is why everybody hated YouTube Rewind 2018.

YouTube Changes Tact With YouTube Rewind 2019
---------------------------------------------

YouTube Rewind 2019 is a direct response to the hate aimed at YouTube Rewind 2018. So much so that the video opens with the line, “In 2018, we made something you didn’t like. For Rewind 2019, let’s see what you DID like.” Which is exactly what the video delivers.

YouTube bills YouTube Rewind 2019 as “Celebrating the creators, music and moments that mattered most to you in 2019.” Hence the lists of most-subscribed creators, most-viewed videos, and most-liked music videos. All of which is based on statistical facts.

In order to avoid any accusation of bias, YouTube has even revealed [how the top lists were generated](https://rewind.youtube/about/). Which involved YouTube delving into data from November 1st, 2019. So if you’re angry about who and what made the cut, blame your fellow YouTube viewers.

Should YouTube Just Kill Rewind Altogether?
-------------------------------------------

YouTube has played it safe here, and that’s fine. What else could it do after [the backlash to YouTube Rewind 2018](//www.makeuseof.com/tag/everyone-hates-youtube-rewind-2018/)? Unfortunately, the dislikes are racking up already, so we suspect YouTube is damned whatever it chooses to do with Rewind. Unless it kills it altogether.
